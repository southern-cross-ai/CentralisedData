<,> <{2><[2>astrology</[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yuk </[1></{1>

<$A> <#\>It's about from the beginning of the universe till now
so
<$B> <#\>Oh I was gonna do that actually instead of doing
politics
<$A> <#\>It's a bit hard to follow
<$B> <#\>Oh <,> thank god I didn't do it <,,> so
<$A> <#\>Friendly birdie 
<$B> <#\>It's an ugly bird <,>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> told ya <#\>The birdie got the
caterpillar instead of me <,>

<O>laughter</O> <,>
<$A> <#\>Are they it's eyes or not
<$B> <#\>Far out this is the first time I've actually seen a
bird eating a caterpillar <,,> <#\>Flew away <#\>It's scared of
you <@>forenameA</@> 
<$A> <#\>Must have good eyes to see that <O>laughter</O> <,>

<$A> <#\>O k <,> <#\>No jokes then
<$B> <#\>Mmm no jokes <O>laughter</O> <#\>No noises either
<@>forenameA</@> no no no don't 
<$A> <#\>Alright <,,> <#\>So what d'you think of the state of
the economy at the moment
<$B> <#\>It's down the tube <O>laughter</O> <#\>It can't go
any lower <,,> <#\>So <@>forenameA</@> talk to me in politics
<$A> <#\>Politics
<$B> <#\>Yeah <,>
<$A> <#\>I dunno <#\>Politics is like <,,> ah sort of
interesting sometimes  <{><[>and</[> boring sometimes <,,> 
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm </[></{>
     <#\>Therefore <,>
<$A> <#\>Therefore we come to the conclusion 
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>That I dunno politics <,,> is alright <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Gee that took a long time didn't it 
<$A> <#\>Hang on <O>cough</O> <,> <#\>I don't really know what
you can do with it but <#\>That's the problem <#\>Sort of
 <{><[><,></[> um you know a lot about government but what
can you really do with it <,>
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm </[></{>
     <#\>What can they do 
<$A> <#\>Mmm what can you do with the knowledge <#\>  You
can't really  <,,>  you could sort of criticise the
government and that but that's about it really
<$B> <#\>That's true
<$A> <#\>You can't really change anything 
<$B> <#\>Oh don't think pessimistically though
<$A> <#\>That's not being pessimistic
<$B> <#\>Yes you are <,,> <#\>You are being pessimistic
<$A> <#\>I just think that um <,,> <#\>  I don't  I
don't   think there should be any government <#\>Should
be just something that controls the economy and that's it
<$B> <#\>And what are you gonna call those people who actually
control the economy 
<$A> <#\>Scum
<$B> <#\>Scum <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Just like they have <O>inaudible</O> government <,>
and let people take care of themselves
<$B> <#\>How
<$A> <#\>What
<$B> <#\>How
<$A> <#\>I dunno<,> just local communities <,> people who work
together <,,> um <,,> <#\>I dunno <#\>  Just have  <w>'cause</w>   it's only a few people <#\>Like at
the top there's all these cocksuckers <O>laughter</O> all
these rich you know<,> selfish greedy power-hungry peoples and
like they don't do anything for anyone except you know <,,>
help their buddies
<$B> <#\>Help their buddies
<$A> <#\>Yeah <,>   they're not really  they're not
there   because they want to help people <#\>They're
there   because  <,,> you know  because  
they're <O>inaudible</O> power-hungry and they've got massive
egos that need to be satisfied <,,> <#\>So that's why I think
government's full of shit 
<$B> <#\>Yeah but if we don't have any government
<$A> <#\>Ah <O>inaudible</O> government <#\>We should have
something that controls certain like <,> parts of society but
  not  <,>  not   control but just sort of
  stable them  stabilise   <,> and try to
improve things
<$B> <#\>  I mean that  isn't that   also
government <#\>Like wouldn't the power-hungries scumbags all
go into those kind of um area as well
<$A> <#\>Um oh it should be worked more on <,> consensus more
on input from other people not just people who go into
politics  <{><[>probably</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah </[></{> but isn't that ideally what
government's supposedly do like 
<$A> <#\>Oh god look the only reason there's   like
Hawke  like Labor or liberal   is because <,> you
know there's nothing else <#\>People don't want to choose
either of them but they have to because they're the only ones
there
<$B> <#\>True <,,> are you on your fourth <O>inaudible</O>
