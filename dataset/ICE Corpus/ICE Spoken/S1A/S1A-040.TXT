<S1A-040> <2010>
<I><$A> <#\>I never I never really thought about it <#\>Um<,> the
first time I thought about it being obvious like<,,> I'd gone
to school and so on<,> and um<,,> some people from England
moved in across the road <{1><[1>from</[1> us <#\>They'd migrated over<,>
<#\>And ah<,,> one of the girls was in my class at school<,,> and
I remember sitting on the bus one day and she said something
and said "eh" at the end and she said <quote>look<,> that's
what you've done to me</quote> <O>Blaughs</O> and I thought
<quote>oh<,> do I do that</quote><,> I mean I never notice
it <#\>And it's only since I moved away when I go home now I
notice people saying it <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>And things like<,> this time
the one thing that really struck me was the<,> the dinner tea
lunch <{3><[3><,></[3> kind of thing <#\>Like you know  they have dinner
and tea as in dinner in the middle of the day and tea at night
and<,> whereas now I just say lunch and dinner <{4><[4>kind</[4> of
thing 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>      <#\>Yeah<,> I can't think of <O>inaudible</O><,> I I can't
remember which way it went<,> 'cos I went to boarding
school<,> so they had people from<,,> all over the place
<{><[><,></[> I guess there's a period there where you all
establish<,> the same language <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>Mmm <#\>So that<,> that was one that just hit me this time
that I<,> sort of hadn't noticed before and I remember<,> how
it used to be
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>That's <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I hadn't been up there for a while so<,,> <#\>How
long've<,> I mean have you haven't lived up there recently<,>
have you
<$B> <#\>Not<,> for quite a while I think <#\>My parents retired<,>
when I in grade twelve and that was<,,> seventy eight<,> <#\>So
it's probably fifteen years ago <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Oh<,> me's old<,> I
thought to myself<,,> <#\>And<,> we went back up a couple of
times after that just <{2><[2>for</[2> four day type things<,> but the
last time we went up<,,> my partner and I <@>Forename1</@> <,> went up
a couple of years ago<,,> in the<,> two week<,> break<,> in
the <O>inaudible</O> June July<,,> and we went<,> camping on
Hinchinbrook for <{3><[3><,></[3> about ten days or so
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Oh</[3></{3>      <#\>That's on my list of <{><[><,></[> my wish list of things to do
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>Well I I'd been before 'cos I went with <O>inaudible</O>
who were bushwalkers<,> group there<,,> and that was funny
because it was a really big group of us that went that year
<#\>There were actually about thirty people <{1><[1>that came</[1> I think
it's good to go in groups of maybe four or so<,> um<,,> and
they've got <O>inaudible</O> twelve or something like that<,>
<#\>But we<,> got there<,> and we were just this great long<,>
troupe of people and you know<,> in fatigues and this sort of
stuff <{2><[2>and we came into this one</[2> gorgeous little beach
called Gold Beach<,> and there was a guy sitting on the
beach<,> meditating or something like that and and he just
sort of and he went <O>anthroponic noise</O> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmhmm</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>It's a bit different going bushwalking</[2></{2> 
<$B> <#\>when he got Landed on by thirty people <{><[>trudging</[> through the bush
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>And as it worked out I actually met these<,,> two those
two guys later on and the other guy was in the nick in the
surf<,> at the time <O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>Apparently he saw us all
coming so he went<,> <{1><[1><O>noise: reeow</O></[1> <O>ABlaugh</O>
<#\><{2><[2>Yeah<,> But when</[2> <@>Forename1</@> and I went back there was lots
of<,> um sandflies<,> and<,> mosquitos and it really wasn't
that pleasant 'cos the only place you could get away from them
was on the beach and<,> it was too cold and a bit sort of a
bit too breezy <{3><[3><,></[3> to sit on the beach<,,>
<$A> <#\><[1>Just kept swimming</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah <O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>      <#\>Yeah <#\>I haven't um<,,> I've never been there <#\>I mean it's
one of those places that's sort of been on my list <{1><[1><,></[1> and
I've actually joined the Brisbane<,> bush walking club <{2><[2><,></[2> and I know a few of them they don't do it as an<,> organised
trip but I know<,,> some of them<,> just organise amongst
themselves every now and again and I<,> I've sort of
<O>inaudible</O> a few weeks ago I can <O>inaudible</O> but
um<,> And a friend of mine<,> did a sea kyaking trip around
Hinchinbrook <#\>Like they actually <{3><[3><,></[3> kyaked across and then
sort of<,> kyaked around and<,> camped <{4><[4>in</[4> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Oh</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>This</[4></{4> is within the island sort of thing <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>There
was a fellow kyaking when we were there <{2><[2><,></[2> but I think he
was an American or a Canadian <{3><[3>or</[3> something like that
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>      <#\>This is on<,> I think <O>inaudible</O> or one of the
groups up there actually runs organised trips <#\>They might
be<,> a vehicle for those <#\>I I'm not sure if they're just
cutting around<,,> Hinchinbrook or if they're act actually
sort of<,> sleeping around the island doing various things or
if they visit any other islands in the channel
<O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>That's that's funny 'cos I actually <O>inaudible</O> trip
down the Zambesi River in<,,> Zimbabwe<,> and um<,,> some
people say<,> <quote>weren't you scared</quote> you know 'cos
there's supposedly crocs and everything everywhere and I just
sort of think <quote>no <#\>'Cos I'm too busy just going
"wow"</quote> <{><[><,></[> so it was great
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>Yeah
     <#\>Yeah I feel like I haven't got out sort of much<,> and
done that sort of stuff <{><[><,></[> so um<,> <@>Forename1</@> and I want
to go overseas next year and stay for a couple of months <#\>Um
<#\>We'll um<,> stay<,> in fairly civilised places like Ireland
for a while<,> and then maybe somewhere in Italy and then
maybe somewhere somewhere in Canada Canada<,> for a month or
so <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[> </{>     <#\>And get a real feel for a place <{><[><,></[> <#\>Have you
travelled over there at all
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>Yeah <#\>I haven't<,> <@>Forename1</@> went over with his parents
when he was about thirteen and lived there for twelve months
<{><[><,></[> so he's ah<,,> <#\>That was<,,> oh from Ireland to Russia
I think
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>I um<,,> I took a year off<,> in<,> ninety <#\><{1><[1><,></[1> I did
the same thing <#\>I worked in Ireland for about<,> five months
and then <{2><[2><,,></[2> sort of did the <O>inaudible</O> trip
around<,> Europe and and I had two months in Africa on the way
back and that's<,> that's where I want to go back to but
<{3><[3><,></[3> I um<,> I actually went back at Christmas time
actually as a big<,,> just for five weeks because I had a sort
of<,,> long distance<,> sort of relationship going
<{4><[4><O>Alaughs</O> which</[4> is a bit ridiculous 'cos I mean<,>
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Right</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Really <#\>Oh</[4></{4>      <#\>Is it still going <#\>Can it work
<$A> <#\>Well yes <#\>He's well<,,> <#\>Kind of<,,> <#\>If you can call it
working I guess<,,> I met<,> I met <@>Forename2</@> in um<,,>
Zimbabwe <{1><[1><,></[1> um<,> and it was a week<,> Af<,> I'd had a
whole year away<,,> and it was the week before I came back to
Australia <{2><[2>and</[2> he was flying back to London<,> and um<,,> we
had like five days together and that was really<,>
<quote>oh<,> well you know<,> <#\>That's really nice</quote> and
I sort of came back here and<,> we sort of wrote letters and
at that point he'd<,> he'd been<,,> he'd been working in the
mines in South Africa and that <#\>He was a metallurgist and
ah<,,> he'd taken six months off and was travelling around
and he was going back to England and<,> had planned to sort of
keep travelling <#\>He thought well maybe he'd come down here and
so I thought <quote>oh well you know</quote> <{3><[3><,></[3> but it was
just nice you know <{4><[4><,></[4> a really nice way to<,> end the
holiday<,,> <#\>And um<,> so we wrote for like<,> a year and he
went back to um<,> to uni to do a<,> a welding<,>
engineer's<,,> ticket and um<,,> got a job with a<,> welding
corporation that does all the<,,> contracts for<,> the work in
the north sea and<,,> so that kind of prevented us<,> sort of
zipping off travelling and<,> <{5><[5>then he couldn't get work</[5> and
I thought <quote>oh that's it</quote> <#\>So we wrote for two
years and then<,,> or a year and a half<,,> and then he
decided<,> <quote>as soon as you get a job</quote> he said
<quote>well now we've got some money <#\>We'd better do something
about it</quote> <#\>So I'll go back over at<,> at Christmas time
because I thought I'd have my holidays <#\>So that was two years
and we hadn't seen each other and I thought well look <#\>I
have<,> I have a few friends living over there now so it was
like <{6><[6><,></[6> plan a b c and x you know<,> in case we take one
look at each other and say <quote>look what am I doing
here</quote> <{7><[7><O>laughs</O></[7> <#\>You know 'cos<,> I thought you
knew this<,> person for five days <{8><[8>and</[8> it was sort of
like<,> you know<,> holidays <O>laughs</O> <#\>You know<,,>
<O>inaudible</O><,> and so we had a really nice five weeks and
it was kind of <quote>well what now</quote><,> so<,,> and he
was still studying<,> and I was still studying so<,,> <#\>If he's
coming over in September <{9><[9>so</[9> <,,> <#\>I'm trying to find subjects
that don't have all of the assignments due <{10><[10>in September</[10> <,>
<#\>So who knows
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>      <#\><[5><O>inaudible</O></[5></{5>      <#\><[6>Mmm</[6> </{6>     <#\><[7><O>laughs</O></[7></{7>	<#\><[8>Yeah</[8></{8>      <#\><[9>Mmm</[9></{9>     <#\><[10>Mmm mmm</[10></{10>      <#\>Mmm<,,> 
<$A> <#\>So that's<,> pretty amazing
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>What a way to run a li a relationship<,>
<$A> <#\>getting a bit long winded now <{><[>though</[> It's like<,,>
time has come to<,,> 
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[> </{>     <#\>Make some decisions
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>I've I've</[></{> had a lot of friends who um<,,> have just
lived in<,> different cities for years at a time and that sort
of thing<,> and eventually it just sort of gets too
ridiculous <{><[><,,></[> <#\>They've<,> <@>Forename3</@> just said to
<@>Forename4</@> <,> <quote>how 'bout we get married and live together
you know</quote> <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\><[><,> yeah</[></{>      <#\>What a novel idea
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>It's just so <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>It's kind of um<,,> <#\>You know<,,> <#\>Make some
decisions to always be in the same place at the same time
<{><[><,></[> It's just the practicalities are a bit<,,> icky
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>So are you still teaching<,> or
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,>
<$B> <#\>And how's that going
<$A> <#\>It's not bad at the moment <#\>Actually um<,,> I actually
quite enjoy what I'm doing at the moment<,> but um<,,> there's
so many changes within<,> education and teaching and<,,>
<O>inaudible</O> the latest little<,> piece to hit the fan
was<,,> <#\>All this stuff about new transfer policy <{1><[1>you know <#\>And the point system and</[1> Yeah<,> <#\>Oh well it<,> sort of came
out in one of our<,> <O>inaudible</O> journals
<O>inaudible</O> a hundred and thirty five<,> extensive list
of<,> exactly what's going on and<,,> there's a lot of people
<{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>So I dunno <#\>You could sa<,> say it's so variable
between schools and between staffs like where I am at the
moment<,> the<,,> specio-staff have a great<,,> a very
supportive staff<,> and they're all<,> we all get on<,> fairly
well and it's very jovial atmosphere and everybody cares about
each other<,> and it's really quite pleasant <#\>I mean<,>
everybody pays out on each other <{3><[3><,></[3> but it's done in a<,>
very nice<,> <{4><[4>positive</[4> kind of way <#\>There's no<,,> really
gross people or<,,> people who're making big put downs all the
time <O>cough</O> <#\>And a brilliant man for a subject master
<#\>He's just the most darling man you know<,> to work with kind
of thing just that<,,> you know<,,> for me including the
management too you know<,> caring and listening<,> but still
very efficient and<,,> makes you want to do the work kind of
thing<,> and the kids aren't too bad but<,> you know<,,> you
could transfer to another school where you've got the really
rotten kids<,> little horrors and<,,> people that you know<,>
aren't very pleasant to work with and <{5><[5><,></[5> it could<,,> be a
big change and I s'pose that's why I sort of<,,> started
choosing <O>inaudible</O> is that having<,,> an extra bow<,>
kind of or an extra<,,> <O>inaudible</O> and also<,> if I
didn't<,> if I wanted to work outside Queensland<,> I
s'pose<,> you know<,,> with a view to perhaps going overseas
<O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>Somewhere way back in the dark depths of my
mind but not very realistic at the moment
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm<,> I've gotta get one of those</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>That's good</[4></{4>      <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5>      <#\>I just<,> you must be in a position to have to<,> keep a
lot of options open <{><[>as well</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah<,></[></{> <#\>So<,,> that<,> you know<,> is is turned out
a little bit different to what I originally thought too I
guess but<,,></I>
