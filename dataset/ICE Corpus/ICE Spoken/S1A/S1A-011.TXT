 <I><$A> <#\>What did you do in your in your holidays
 <$B> <#\>Um I was practising most of the time 'cause ah,
 <$A> <#\>What your band
 <$B> <#\>Yeah yeah well we've got a we we were sort of in
this long drawn out process of recording at the moment <#\>Sort
of like we sort of oh the people who are producing it we were
relying upon them to um they're doing it for free <#\>Like in
their own spare time <#\>So,
 <$A> <#\>So do you actually get paid or anything
 <$B> <#\>No <#\>No no <#\>We we we fork out a fortune <O>laugh</O>
 <$A> <#\>Are you intend to um to making a album
 <$B> <#\>Just depends who's if we can  <#\>Depends if we get a
contract or something 'cause it costs a lot of money to make
an album <#\>You know see like what we're doing is we're making
C
D a C D single <#\>Have you seen them at all
 <$A> <#\>Yeah
 <$B> <#\>We're making one of them by ourselves with our own
money
 <$A> <#\>How much does it cost
 <$B> <#\>It's gonna cost us about five grand <#\>Something like
that <#\>And then um when we've ahh<,,> when we've um done that
and then you know we'll just use that and see what happens
with that see <#\>The idea is that you know we sort of ah taken
a
bit of a a bet on ourselves you know
 <$A> <#\>A bed
 <$B> <#\>Bet
 <$A> <#\>Oh a bet
 <$B> <#\>We've gambled on ourselves 'cause you know we've
sort of like gone into huge debt and um
 <$A> <#\>What what debt
 <$B> <#\>five thousand dollars debt
 <$A> <#\>Oh for that C D
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Plus other things we've got all year <#\>We've
probably spent about probably by the end of the year we've
probably spent seven or eight grand so
 <$A> <#\>But if you play in clubs and all that you'll make
the money
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Yeah <#\>To play in clubs you have to you have
to
um <#\>To play in clubs you have to either be playing covers like
old songs
 <$A> <#\>covers 
 <$B> <#\>Yes <#\>Stuff that everyone knows you know like stuff
from the sixties or something <#\>Yeah stuff that everyone knows
really well so they can go along and get pissed and
 <$A> <#\><O>laugh</O>
 <$B> <#\>you know like listen to all the music that they all
their <{><[>favourite</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[> </{>
 <$B> <#\>records and don't have to you know <#\>You can either
do that or if you're gonna play your own music you have to um
make a name for yourself so that people go <quote>Oh that's
that new band I heard on the radio</quote> and they come along
and see it <#\>And to do that you have to um you have to try and
you know sort of ah do what we're doing you know get make
something yourself and then and then you know see how that
goes <#\>You know and if you get some interest from that then
maybe a record company might <#\>If a record company likes it
they might say oh well you know
 <$A> <#\>What instr what instrument do you play
 <$B> <#\>Bass guitar
 <$A> <#\>Do you <#\>Do you play anything else
 <$B> <#\>Yeah yeah I've played I I've played guitar for years
and  I've played the bass guitar in a band
 <$A> <#\>How about trumpet
 <$B> <#\><O>laugh</O>

road
 <$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Are they expensive <#\>Those instruments
 <$B> <#\>Trumpets <#\>Oh yeah <#\>A few hundred yeah oh yeah if
you
want to <#\>It's like anything with all musical instruments you
know depends how much you um how much how good you want <#\>You
can get you know for instance you can get guitars you know for
a couple of hundred dollars up to you know a good one's two
three grand and then you can get really really expensive ones
that are like ten grand fifteen twenty grand but it
 <$A> <#\>A piano a piano's worth about probably ten thousand
dollars
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>A piano is sort of a little bit more expensive
I think 'cause there's a lot more work in it <#\>Oh well you know
they're bigger I think <#\>I dunno I dunno at the higher range
whether they're the same as guitars <#\>Probably probably not
<#\>There's probably still pianos that are worth a hundred
thousand or something

<O>laugh</O>
 <$A> <#\>You never got around to it
 <$B> <#\>No <#\>I mean I wanted well it's a combination of never
got around to it and never had the money 'cause you know I've
always mostly been on the dole or at uni and and you know you
don't often have a a a cheque where you've got a hundred
dollars spare to go and do it
 <$A> <#\>Have you ever tried getting you know
 <$B> <#\>I had my L's once <#\>I can drive <#\>I can drive like

 <$A> <#\><[>You live</[></{> too far away
 <$B> <#\>Well no <#\>See I public I always use public transport
like you know as a rule <#\>But like there are some occasions
where for instance with my band where I should be I should
really carry my share of of the load and do the driving but
that's like rare <#\>So I really it's not that important but um
I'd like to get my licence anyhow<,> <#\>But you know I mean
round
the city you don't need it
 <$A> <#\>No you don't need it <#\>It's too crowded <O>inaudible
4
syllables</O>
 <$B> <#\>Yeah there's public everywhere 
 <$A> <#\>it's
 <$B> <#\>I mean I've always travelled you know
 <$A> <#\>It's it's very hard to find a parking spot in the
city
 <$B> <#\>Yeah yeah for sure <#\>And like that you know not to
mention the fact that you're like poisoning yourself and
things like that <#\>Which it probably doesn't really matter
though does it <#\>It's not important
 <$A> <#\>But you you could live you know out in the country
in the middle of nowhere
 <$B> <#\>Yes

 <$B> <#\>Yeah my God <#\>Where where do they go out west west
or
something
 <$A> <#\>Oh they they live in the country
 <$B> <#\>Oh <{><[>right</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So,</[></{> they they're really country style people
 <$B> <#\>Where whereabouts
 <$A> <#\>From everywhere like 
 <$B> <#\><{><[>Oh right</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Tamworth</[></{> <#\>You know <#\>All over the place
 <$B> <#\>Well I was down at Wagga last year for a year and a
mate of mine had a bike there and he lived about twenty k's
out of town
 <$A> <#\>Did he have the <O>inaudible 11 syllables</O>
 <$B> <#\><O>laugh</O> He went very close actually one night <#\>Hm<,>
<O>laugh</O>
 <$A> <#\><O>laugh</O>
 <$B> <#\>Actually its yeah <#\>We we'd been up to out at his
farm
 <$A> <#\>Yeah
 <$B> <#\>and we got out in the middle of the night <#\>Like you
know three in the morning or something after a cask of wine or
something like that <#\>And um we'd had a big dinner or
something <#\>No no no yeah yeah we had that had a dinner that
night but yeah we'd had quite a lot to drink and you know
conceived the idea 'cause he'd been telling me he was gonna
teach me to ride his bike but always wanted to learn <#\>Let's
go
out and learn so we ended up rapping all around these country
roads 
 <$A> <#\>By yourself
 <$B> <#\>No no he was giving me a double 
 <$A> <#\>Oh
 <$B> <#\>explaining the gears <#\>Bahm bahm like this you know
this is how you do it right <#\>Bought it back and when I hopped
on it just would not start and then <@>Forename1</@> hopped on
and it wouldn't start again <#\>You know just lucky really you
know
 <$A> <#\>Something superstitious <O>laugh</O>
 <$B> <#\>I think I would have I would have just started it up
in first gear and driven like into the fence and that would
have fallen over and gone to sleep and that would have been
it <#\>I don't know <#\>But like you know that was a crazy night
<#\>And anyhow we got up the next morning and and I went into uni
with his um flatmate um <@>Forename2</@> and ah in her car and he
took the bike <#\>Normally I'd get a double in with him and
<@>Forename2</@> was going at the same time so I thought I'd get
a lift in the car
 <$A> <#\>Safer <O>laugh</O>
 <$B> <#\><O>laugh</O> Safer <#\>Well I mean like didn't even sort of
occur to me but um after all that rapping round the night
before at top speeds and not falling off you know we could
have killed ourselves at that speed <#\>The next morning he was
doing the the turning to into the university and there was
gravel,
 <$A> <#\>Oh
 <$B> <#\>And he was just at the slowest speed just doing
round this turn and and like it lost it and pow come down you
know and like skinned all his leg at that <#\>But like you know
we were all down at the bar you know <#\>Where's <@>Forename1</@> 
he's sure taking his time 'cause he had to walk his bike the
rest of the way it wouldn't start
 <$A> <#\>And so w was he cut or anything
 <$B> <#\>He'd just cut and that <#\>Yeah but like you know he
he'd just come in and he said <quote>Mate that's the that's a
bit of a lesson there for us</quote></I>
