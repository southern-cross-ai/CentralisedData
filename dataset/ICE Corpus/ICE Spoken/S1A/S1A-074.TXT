<O>laughter</O> <#\>Thank you very much <#\>Ah dear I've never
heard of anyone else who collects milk cartons and I don't
think I ever will
<$B> <#\>No <#\>What's your trophy for?
<$A> <#\>That's for the Eisteddfod piano
<$B> <#\>When did you do that?
<$A> <#\>It was year ah year year year oh <,> nine or ten I
think <w>'cause</w> <,,> um that was the one  where 
um  where   I was playing at and like I played alright
<{1><[1>at um</[1> year ten <#\>and um then everyone else they
were all brilliant players but they all went over the time
limit so they all got <{2><[2>disqualified</[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>Mhmmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh that's</[2></{2> right yeah <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>So I came first
<$B> <#\>Do you reckon you would've won <{1><[1>it
without</[1> if they <{2><[2>hadn't been disqualified</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>No</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>No no way</[2></{2> <#\>No I probably would've
come about tenth
<$B> <#\>Have you ever seen how to tune a guitar?
<$A> <#\>Have I ever seen how to tune a guitar?
<$B> <#\>No?
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Have ya?
<$A> <#\>Yeah <,,> <#\>But I find it easier to do cos
when you do that I find  if  if   you now
played the forth like if  you can <,> <#\>It's out of tune ok
<#\>It's because it's a HaHawaiian guitar <,,>
<$B> <#\>They should be the same note though the same string
<$A> <#\>No no <,,> <#\>I find it easier to do <O>inaudible
two syllables</O> pressing on it like <,,> <#\>Voyage of The
Dawn Treader <O>inaudible six syllables</O>
<$B> <#\>And what's it about so far?
<$A> <#\>This voyage <O>laughter</O> <#\>Funny that <#\>But
there's one bit which I really like <{1><[1>and</[1> ah <,>
<#\>Now that's Reevecheck <#\>You know how I was telling you
about Reevecheck <{2><[2>the mouse</[2>? <#\>That's Reevecheck
and um Eusted <#\>He becomes a dragon thing  and  because  he's really self-cantered and then he meets
Aslan who's like the kind of parallel of Jesus in the
<{3><[3>story</[3> and um <,> kind of like  he  um <,>
 he wants  he can't get  he can't   become
 a  a   boy again from <{4><[4>being</[4> a
dragon <#\>And then <,> he goes with Aslan to this pool and he
wants to get in the pool except he can't get in the pool until
he's taken all his um scaly skin off so he starts taking one
layer off and thinks oh good but then he thinks <quote>oh no
I'll just take the next layer</quote> and he keeps on and he
can't get it all off and then um Aslan comes along and um <,>
oh where is it <#\>Aslan comes along and he says <quote>oh I
have to undress you</quote> and so he made a really deep tear
which is really deep  and  and   then he pulls
it all off <{5><[5>so that's</[5> kind of like pulling all
your skin off <{6><[6><,></[6> and um then he turns around and
he goes 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yep</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mhmmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mhmmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mhmmm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Oh I see</[5></{5>
     <#\><[6>Mhmmm</[6></{6>
     <#\>And did it hurt when he pulled it off?
<$A> <#\>Yeah you see
<$B> <#\>Oh I see
<$A> <#\>Then it was better after that
<$B> <#\>Mmm <#\>So what's the significance of it hurting at
first and then <,> it all coming off?
<$A> <#\>Um that it's not easy <#\>well I mean it hurts
<w>'cause</w> you want to stay like you are
<$B> <#\>Hmm <#\>That's good <,,> <#\>What's <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Ah that's just  for  um  a calendar  
for what I have at uni my assignments <{1><[1>and things</[1>
