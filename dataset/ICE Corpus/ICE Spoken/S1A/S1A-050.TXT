perception of the whole thing<,>
<$A> <#\>Oh yeah

<$A> <#\>I know <#\>He always tells <{><[>some<,> thing different
something different</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>But he says<,> he says it</[></{> something like 
<quote>oh<,> I
didn't tell the others that<,> because<,,> I didn't tell the
others that because like I didn't think that it would<,,> you
know<,> was the right thing to tell them</quote> <#\>I mean like
when
<@>forename4</@> ran into a goalpost he told
you something different to what he told me <#\><quote>I
didn't know how <@>forename5</@> would take it</quote> <#\>As

a shit<,,> I mean I do because I know him but I don't
<O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>But I don't in the sense that like<,,>
<#\>You
know<,,> <#\>It isn't like I'm after him or anything
<$A> <#\>It was just really interesting to<,> to like<,> watch
people like that<,> I mean he<,> he goes on about us like<,,>
well he'll talk about things like <quote>oh you know I never get
invited out here or there</quote> and you know <quote>I don't
have a social
life</quote>
<$B> <#\>Hmm well that's not my fault
<$A> <#\>And then he goes out and like<,> he doesn't even have
a
good time<,> <#\>Like he sits there and worries about <{><[>what
<O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>But he never <#\>Can you believe</[></{>  like what
happened at the traffic lights right <#\>When <@>forename2</@> 
got out the car<,,> and<,> he<,> was pulling up the
windscreen wipers and that<,> <#\>Everyone else was killing
themselves laughing<,,> and he just<,> sat there and showed
absolutely no emotion at all<,>

imagine it and like<,> it all went down my bodysuit<,,> and
like then<,> the ice<,> as well <#\>I mean like I was just
sitting there and he started pegging it at me<,> then he
just<,> threw handfuls and I was just laughing so much I was
crying and I just couldn't move out of my seat<,> and then he
just walked over to me and got there was a like about a one
centimetre layer in the bottom of it<,> and just tipped it
over my head<,><O> B laughs </O> and the popcorn went all over me<,,>

found it hard because<,,> I knew everyone so I was trying to
talk to everyone<,>
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>     <@>forename7</@> thought <O>Blaughs</O> he was a fool

really
like<,> up himself <{><[><,></[> <#\>He just sounded like he really
thought he was good<,,> I dunno <#\>Guys find that<,,> a bit
offensive<,> I think at times
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>     <#\>Yeah <#\>I know<,,> <{><[><O>inaudible</O> two guys or<,>a girl</[>
<$A> <#\><[>It's the same as what a girl <O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
     <#\>Well I was sitting there thinking<,> oh<,> you know
<#\>He's
just going on <quote>I've got this and I've got that</quote> and
<@>forename7</@> <,> was just kind of sitting there going<,>
<quote>oh<,,> OK<,,> <#\>Who cares</quote>
<$B> <#\>Exactly <#\>So what'd <@>forename6</@> think<,,>
<$A> <#\>Well <@>forename6</@> thought he was nice<,>
<#\>Because
<O>inaudible</O> he's a nice guy<,> but<,,> I don't know
<#\>They don't know him the way that we do though <#\><{1><[1>Like</[1> it's
really hard
<#\><{2><[2>Like they</[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>'Cos we work</[2></{2> with him so we see that side of him
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>So<,,> they thought he was al they thought he
was
quite nice<,> you know<,> <#\>He was <,> <#\>He was quite willing
to<,,> sit down and<,> talk to those guys all about himself
<O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>They've never been out with him once so<,,>
that's fair enough but yeah
<$B> <#\>So what did <@>forename6</@> think of
<@>forename8</@> <,,>
<$A> <#\>Woooow <O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>He thinks she's really

<#\>He hasn't got enough guts <#\>He needs to get more guts<,>
<$B> <#\>Neither's she though<,,>
<$A> <#\>I know but who is <@>forename8</@> suited to
<$B> <#\>She's suited to some one really intelligent<,,> but
that
can<,> like<,,> crack a good joke <#\>Some one who's on the
ball<,> about things <#\>Like<,> on the ball about current
affairs <{1><[1>and</[1> stuff like that so that they can<,,> like<,,>
you know like<,> crack the one liners and stuff like that <#\>I
mean that's it's gotta be some one who can make jokes and be
like<,,> who's got that really<,,> her kind of sense of
humour 'cos she's got a definite sense of humour <{2><[2><,,> <#\>You</[2> <,>can see<,> what she enjoys<,,> and <O>inaudible</O>

<@>forename6</@> and <@>forename10</@> were sitting next to
each other and <@>forename2</@> 's giving signs like<,> thumbs
up from the other end of the row and I was killing myself
laughing right <O>Blaugh</O><?>Rebecca</?>'s sitting next to
me<,> and then<,,> um<,,> yeah and then at the coffee shop it
worked out that way because<,,> <@>forename2</@> said what
happened then though was that <@>forename6</@> was the first
one to sit down <#\>I sat down and <@>forename6</@> sat down
<{><[>and <O>inaudible</O></[> sat on the other side of the table and
you three were already there <,> and then <@>forename2</@> 
said to <@>forename10</@> <quote>I'm sitting there</quote>
because he
wanted to sit between me and <@>forename6</@> <,,> and then
<@>forename9</@> said <quote>no <#\>I am</quote> <#\>And she sat
down so she
was actually the one like<,> that sat next to him <#\>I s'pose

sitting<,> like next to him but<,> <O>Awhistles</O><,> so<,,>
<#\>No but Yeah no <@>forename10</@> said last night
<@>forename10</@> was just being crude  and she goes<,>

<{><[>ring</[> through his nipple ergh<,,>
<$B> <#\><[>okay</[></{> 
     <#\>But um<,,> <@>forename10</@> was saying <quote>oh I'd
have him
<O>inaudible</O></quote> <O>ABlaugh</O> <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$B> <#\>No she's not like that<,> <#\>She's just stirring<,,>
<O>Alaughs</O><,,> 
<$A> <#\><{><[>You awful person</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Sam's a classic though</[></{>      <#\>She so funny I just<,> 'cos<,,> I like we went to
school
together and at school she was always the big heav
<@>forename10</@> was always the one <{1><[1>from like</[1> day one of
year seven <,> <{2><[2>down the back</[2> <,> smoking <,> and then like
you know<,> by the time everyone started to<,> getting into
smoking dope <@>forename10</@> was like you know<,> the hero
the<,> you know the legend<,> she was the first one to do it
sort of thing and all that sort of stuff and she was<,> and I
was just like<,> I never<,> really<,> said anything <#\>The only
time I spoke to her at school <#\>She was never in any of my
classes or anything <#\>The only reason I spoke to her was 'cos
she lives across the road from <@>forename9</@> <{3><[3><,> and</[3> up the street from <@>forename2</@> so whoever drove to
school they use to like give<,> like say if<,>
<@>forename9</@> drove to school then she'd like pick up
<@>forename2</@> and <@>forename10</@> <,,> and I'd just meet
them at school but then like I we used to all go home
together
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh yeah <#\>You can tell</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>MmHmm</[3></{3>    <#\>It's really <{1><[1>funny</[1> the way things have changed though
<{2><[2><,></[2> because like it's been a real kind of like<,,> with
your group there's been a real merge <#\>Like everybody's even
though youse've gone to uni youse've still merged <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>I
dunno <#\>Maybe it's just because <@>forename2</@> 's<,,> like
come to our uni <#\><{4><[4>I</[4> don't know <#\>Whereas in my group
like<,>
nobody merged <#\>They all just went their<,> separate ways <#\>I
guess <{5><[5>'cos</[5> a lot of us didn't go to uni <#\>There were only
really two of us <{6><[6>who went to uni</[6> <,,>
<$B> <#\><[1>and so</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>     <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>     <#\><[5>Mmm</[5></{5>     <#\><[6>Yeah</[6></{6>     <#\><{><[>Yeah that makes a difference</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>That makes it really like you can see though like</[></{><,,>
<#\>I
never use to think it would be true but now you can really see
the difference that it makes<,> <#\>Like when I look at your
group to my group<,,> you know like my group's just non-
existent whereas your group's like<,> merged <#\>Like<,,>
<{><[>everybody knows everybody</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>But see <#\>Yeah</[></{> <,>  <#\>Well we weren't<,> we
never<,> like
at school<,> <@>forename2</@> sat with<,> <#\>Like in the end<,>
like say for year eleven and twelve<,> <@>forename2</@> sat
with <@>forename11</@> <@>surname11</@> and stuff <#\>And all those
people<,> <#\>The people that I sat with<,,> the only people I
see now are <@>forename12</@> and <@>forename13</@> and I
hardly even see <O>inaudible</O><,> and like
<@>forename13</@> called in last week and then we didn't see
her and then<,,> ah<,> <@>forename9</@> sat with<,> <#\>There
was her <@>forename14</@> <,> <@>forename15</@> and
<@>forename16</@> <,,> and then like<,> and they were like
there was<,> our year was sort of split in half I s'pose</I>
