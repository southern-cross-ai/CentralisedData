<S2A-013> <2008>
<I><$A> <#\>Hello and welcome right round the country as millions
of Australians tune in for our greatest television drama the
countdown to decide our national government for the next three
years <#\>Over the next five or six hours we'll crisscross the
continent with every twist and turn in what promises to be an
absorbing struggle <#\>The race is off to a dramatic start
<#\>Daylight saving closed the polls an hour early in Tasmania
where the count is now well underway <#\>And it looks as though
Labor has picked up at least two and possibly three seats from
the Coalition <#\>We'll go straight to those early figures but
let me quickly introduce the expert commentary team bringing you
your verdict tonight from the national tally room here in
Canberra <#\>Our panel is headed by the A B C's chief political
correspondents Paul Lyneham and Jim Middleton <#\>They're backed
by two of Canberra's more seasoned campaigners Foreign Minister
Gareth Evans who was also with us last election and Andrew
Peacock who was otherwise engaged on that occasion as the
standard bearer of the Coalition challenge <#\>We'll be following
the count through a special computer program designed by the A
B C's election analyst Anthony Green who'll watch for those
telltale shifts and trends throughout the night <#\>We're also
plugged directly into the engine room of this election night the
voting booths from where party scrutineers are relaying first-
hand details of the count to the party number crunchers Bob
McMullen for Labor and the Liberal's Peter Costello <#\>They're
with Kerry O'Brien in their own bunker in the tally room <#\>So
with all bases covered let's go to these uh remarkable first
figures for the night which our computer-generated graphics will
uh break down into uh some easy to follow displays <#\>Well Paul
Lyneham what've you got
<$B> <#\>Well let's go to the first seat of Denistone <#\>Uh
Labor
expected to hold Denistone <#\>Uh this is uh Duncan Kerr's seat
in a Hobart seat <#\>He's not only holding Denistone he's uh
built 
enormously in Denistone <#\>In fact uh you're looking at a uh uh
where are we for Kerr uh a swing of five point eight um per cent
on two party preferred terms nine point three per cent swing to
Labor <#\>And uh not only are th- are they going to hold Dennyson
they're going to they have already won Franklin and Lions and I
think I'd probably give them Bass as well
<$A?> <#\><O>5 syll</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>Well it is a sensational start as I said
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>We'll come back to that uh to that shortly
to the <?>real</?> figures uh on that if we can because I think
as as we look at these uh Tasmanian seats we need to bear in mind
that uh Dr Hewson only has to gain five more seats to uh oust the
Keating government <#\>Now in all probability he'll win twice
that many new seats tonight but Labor is hoping to offset those
losses by itself picking up some seats uh from the Coalition
<#\>And op course its best chance of doing that is down there in
the Apple Isle where uh there are two long-standing Liberal
members who are retiring <#\>Now those are in those critical
seats of Franklin and Lions <#\>Let's have a close look at those
now
<$B> <#\>Well Franklin is all Hobart east of the river <?>and</?>
southern Tasmania <#\>Uh uh Bruce Goodluck uh of course stood
down at this election <#\>Uh you've got Graham Gilbert standing
for the Liberals and uh uh <#\>Well he's uh he's not doing too
well there against Harry Quick for the Labor party <#\>Let's look
at this uh uh in a percentage terms <#\>And you see the A L P's
got forty nearly for- fifty per cent <#\>The Libs thirty-nine per
cent <#\>And let's watch that swingometer up in the top as we
look at this two party preferred <#\>You see it swinging right
up into the red <#\>A L P gains Franklin
<$A> <#\>Well that's great news for Harry Quick uh is on the line
on the ground now down there in uh in Franklin <#\>Harry Quick
thanks for joining us tonight uh <#\>You've done extraordinarily
well by the look of things <#\>Are you prepared to claim at this
stage
<$C> <#\>No <#\>Not really <#\>Uh <?>it too</?> early night still
uh <#\>But with forty-two per cent of the vote counted where
there's almost a swing of eleven percent towards us
<$A> <#\>Only <#\>I'm sorry <#\>A swing of nearly eleven per cent
<$C> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>With forty-two per cent of the vote counted <#\>And
you're not prepared to claim it
<$C> <#\>Well uh this is my first my first time and uh <?>3
syll</?>
<$?> <#\><O>3 syll</O> <?>too slow</?>
<$A> <#\>I dunno why they call you Harry Quick
<O>inaudible</O> <O>laughs</O> <#\>Anyway we'll we'll leave
it there <#\>Thanks very much for that <#\>Well the other
<?>typical</?> Tasmanian seat of course is Lions by far the
island state's uh biggest electorate <#\>It's held by the
smallest margin <#\>What's happening there Paul
<$B> <#\>Well what's happening there is that uh uh is that
Labor's again doing extraordinarily well <#\>This is uh the <?>s-
</?> big central Tasmanian seat <#\>And uh y- you've got the
Liberal's uh <@>Forename1 Surname1</@> uh trailing uh uh D- Dick
Adams uh quite significantly <#\>And look at this in terms of the
share nearly fifty per cent for the A L P <#\>And watch that
swingometer up in the top right-hand corner <#\>Up into the red
<#\>The computer says A L P gains uh Lions
<$A> <#\>Well that's very bad news for uh for <@>Forename1
Surname1</@> who I can see on our uh our <O>2 syll</O> uh monitor
there <#\><@>Forename1 Surname1</@> down there in Lions thankyou
for joining our telecast <#\>You've got the smile there now but
I guess it's uh a fairly uncomfortable one <#\>This is not the
result you were looking forward to
<$D> <#\>Well I'm like Harry Quick <#\>It's my first time
<#\><?>I'm</?> not sure when I should smile or not
<$?> <O>laughs</O>
<$D> <#\>Um eight- eighteen point five pe- per cent counted
<#\>That's a little early <#\>But uh I was hoping for a better
result at this stage <O>2 syll</O>
<$A> <#\>Yo- Had you seen this coming <#\>Did the last few days
of the campaign tell you anything
<$D> <#\>Well not really <#\>I thought we'd uh picked up this uh
against this massive uh anti <?>G S T</?> advertising that we had
down here <#\>But uh it looks like uh Paul Keating got his wish
in turning this into a <?>G S T</?> referendum <#\>And that's how
it's turning out in Tasmania
<$?> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Alright <@>Forename1</@> thankyou for that <#\>Well
let's take uh a quick look at the other Tasmanian seats now Bass
and Braddon <#\>Then we'll see if we can pick up a a state-wide
trend for Tasmania <#\><O>1 syll</O> Bass <O>2 syll</O>
<$B> <#\>Bass <?>this</?> is Launceston and the north-east coast
of Tasmania <#\>Warwick Smith uh uh against Sylvia Smith the A
L P's candidate a teacher <#\>And she is doing extremely well
indeed <#\>Let's have a look at this in percentage terms of the
primary vote <#\>Uh A L P forty-seven Lib forty-three <#\>Now
watch that swingometer up in the top right-hand corner <#\>Round
into the red <#\>A very tight contest could quite easily on these
figures go to Labor
<$A> <#\>Well again another extraordinary result <#\>Braddon you
would think though would surely stay in Coalition hands <#\>That
was certainly their safest seat in Tasmania <#\>What's happening
there
<$B> <#\>Yeah well Braddon was their safest seat <?>but</?>
<@>Surname2</@> came in with a margin of eight point three per
cent <#\>The A L P's Mike Gard is uh uh coming up very strongly
there <#\>But I don't think strong enough <#\>Look at the uh 
percentages of that vote <#\><@>Surname</@> is over fifty-two
there <#\>Watch the swingometer <#\>It'll prob'ly peak out <#\>No
<#\>Right back the other way <#\>Of course it does <#\><?>Uh</?>
fifty-two <#\>So the Libs are going to keep Braddon <#\>But
that's one out of four Tasmanian seats <#\>Now apparently in
Coalition hands
<$A> <#\>Well <?>uh</?> with some doubt uh though at this stage
still of course <#\>Okay let's uh go to uh the tr- overall trend
if we can uh for Tasmania <#\>And Paul uh this is showing us
<#\>I think we we can give the the vote in all those seats
grouped together here <#\>And that's how it's showing up for the
Labor Party
<$B> <#\>Well A L P forty-seven <#\>Liberals forty <#\>Uh this
is the uh A L P's Tasmanian dream come true <#\>This is for Labor
a very very good start to the campaign <#\>I think you can tell
that by the look on Andrew Peacock's face right now <#\>He's just
managed to smile <O>laughter</O> <#\>He's just managed one
<#\>Let's have a look at this uh Let's have a look at this two
party preferred <#\>And that tells the story even clearer <#\>And
if you wait a sec we'll go and see the swing here <#\>And this
is the state-wide swing a swing to the A L P at seven point two
per cent
<$A> <#\><O>4 syll</O> the Liberal Party with much the same uh
<O>2 syll</O> <#\>Though they are extraordinary early figures <#\>Andrew Peacock uh
this is not what what you wanted to be seeing at this early stage
of the night obviously
<$E> <O>clears throat</O> <#\>No it's not Andrew <#\>Uh but after
all in any event it's not where you start it's where you finish
<#\>And I think the longer face will be on Gareth uh when you
move up the country to Queensland and then across to Western
Australia and South Australia
<$A> <#\>How does it tally with your overall expectations <O>3
syll</O>
<$E> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$E> <#\>I I have to say that uh I hadn't in my own mind
<?>er</?> given Bass to the Labor Party <#\>So uh <#\>And I don't
yet
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$E> <#\>I mean e- <#\>Yeah and your computer says that it's
still <O>4 syll</O>
<$A> <#\><O>4 syll</O>
<$E> <#\>But uh at this stage uh a loss of two seats is not
helpful <#\>But uh we did anticipate if we were going to lose
some it could be in Tasmania 
<$A> <#\>Gareth Evans
<$E> <#\>But uh it's it's a strong start to the Labor Party <O>5
syll</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>It is a strong start to the Labor isn't it
<$F> <#\><O>2 syll</O> <?>the best news</?> is the result in Bass
I think <#\>We were tending to factor in Franklin and Lyons as
wins for us and predicting uh <O>1 syll</O> the necessity for
those wins if we were going to be able to counter the the losses
in South Australia Queensland and and Western Australia <#\>Uh
but that tallies with the kind of anecdotal evidence that's been
coming out in the last week <#\>I was told uh just twenty-four
hours ago that uh Warwick Smith was seen doorknocking in houses
with uh Labor Party placards outside them <#\>Such was the
<?>group</?> panic that was setting in there <#\>And it needs to
be remembered that the figures that we're seeing this year are
direct booth comparisons <#\>So we don't <#\>We <?>are</?>
comparing <?>apples</?> with our <?>swings</?> <#\>These are real
swings and after nearly twenty per cent of the vote is counted
you've got uh nearly six per cent swing to Labor there which is
well and truly enough to win the seat
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>Although as uh Andrew Peacock said a moment ago
of course uh there are other states yet <#\>Indeed this election
is likely to unfold in a series of instalments tonight <#\>As we
said Tassie's got a an hour's jump on the mainland <#\>The other
eastern states are now about half an hour into the count <#\>But
the polls closed just a few minutes ago in South Australia
<#\>And over in Western Australia they've still got an hour and
a half of voting ahead of them <#\>Andrew O'Connor joins us now
from the most marginal seat in the west <#\>Sterling Andrew
<#\>What's happening over there
<$G> <#\>Well Andrew the sun's still up and the booths are still
open here in the west <#\>I don't know what you can see behind
me but we still have a few voters ambling in to cast that crucial
last-minute vote <#\>The choice today is between a Liberal
challenger Ian Cameron a well-known local broadcaster and the
Labor incumbent Ron Edwards <#\>Edwards of course is best known
for his role as the deputy speaker</I>
