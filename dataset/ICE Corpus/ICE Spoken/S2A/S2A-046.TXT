<S2A-046> <2055>
<I><$A> <#\>I I started off from a a
very a practical problem <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>What I was interested in was <O>laugh</O> the the <,> the notion of decontextualised and
contextualised language use <#\>It it 
seemed curious to me if fact when I first heard about um
similar terms like um Ruqaiya's um<,> context dependent
independent<,> um terms too which are really um synonymous
with um decontextualised and contextualised language <#\>I
always thought it was rather curious because in a functional
model of language ah all language is considered to be
contextualised<,> <#\>I realised that people were<,> talking
about something and that this something was important <#\>Well
in the literature on er you know child um language development
proper development and the development of literacy<,>
decontextualised language use was considered absolutely
crucial <#\>In fact it was considered to be a prerequisite<,>
for um in um the development of literacy
for example <#\>So it seemed important to me to you know try
and nail down<,> exactly what it was and how it fitted in um
to um you know a model of language of language such as the
systemic functional model and um<,> the other other reason was<,> that <#\>I I might add that I've been working on Ruqaiya's
mother child play for ten ten years this
year would you believe<,> and it's an absolute goldmine <#\>I
mean it hasn't been mined completely but I'm <,>
 I was pleased to be able <#\>I was you know
absolutely thrilled to be able to use that data because<,>
when I was coding it ah ah for ah Ruqaiya's um<,> parameters
what you know she was interested in<,> it's been absolutely
fantastic a great breakthrough but I I 
always felt there was something we weren't capturing and what
we weren't capturing was the way in which<,> intonation and
<O>inaudible</O> in various ways<,> and um<,> some time ago I
suggested to Ruqaiya that I'd like to do this this this you know <O>inaudible</O> ah but that sort of
died down <#\>But as it happens<,> everything comes
together<,> in the subconscious or somewhere and it
that it all sort of jells <#\>So I'll explain
that ah how that <,,> how I worked that
out <#\>But I I thought of it as quite
important to to to mention the process of
all this because I I find it quite
inspirational that <,> that um this is a
demonstration <#\>Well I'm inspired that that Halliday's<,,> um reluctance to distinguish
inside a theoretical <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Anyway<,> so what is
decontextualised language <#\>Well I suppose<,> um it's
language that is<,> context independent perhaps that you could
describe it as what Halliday called language<,> as
reflection<,,> um as opposed to contextualised language which
is language in action context dependent language <#\>What<,> ah I said to myself what is <,> what are likely to be the sema ah semantic <,> parameters of this kind of language I
thought <#\>The the thing the things <,>
the interactants would talk about<,> when language is colle ah contextualised <#\>So called
contextualised <#\>Context dependent <#\>Those things or
entities<,> semantics term things will be<,> in the<,> here
and now and that ah will be ah er present in the material
situation or setting<,> <#\>Okay <#\>And the events that
they'll be talking about will be occurring<,> in the here and
now<,,> whereas with decontextualised language<,> the entities
are likely to be absent from the material situation or setting
or they're likely to be generic kind of entities<,> things that um ah ah things that you refer to
in classes or such like<,> <#\>And the events<,> spoken about
will<,> possibly<,> be occur be things that
occur on all occasions events that always occur or
events that occurred in in the past or in
the future <#\>Okay these are semantic<,> categories <#\>What
I had to do was tie them down<,> and<,> specify the lexico-
grammatical realisations of these things<,,> entities and
events<,> and then analyse each of each of 
the messages in <#\>Well I I chose a text
of about four hundred main messages and<,> the text extract
you've got<,> is one such <,> one such text 
<#\>Um I in I I originally planned to look
at all of Ruqaiya's twenty four mother child er dyads<,> ah
but as it turned out um I just didn't have the time and I could
only do<,> a very small indicative study of of eight of them <#\>Um<,> and I controlled for
the actual material setting and the events that were happening
in it in the talk of the the eight dyads
<#\>I chose<,,> mealtime conversations<,> so when the mother
and child were sitting down I presume<,,> <#\>Um<,,> and<,> I
concentrated on just this one text of which you have an
extract<,,> ah and and poured over this
and what I did was I thought what I needed to do is to
analyse<,> every<,> entity or participant in every message and
also various things about the event whether the event was
happening at<,> now whether it happened in the past or the
future um whether it happened on all occasions etcetera
<#\>And I<,> coded the four hundred odd messages and put them
into the computer thinking I'd you know<,> spit it out and let
the the computer programs the <O>inaudible</O>
programs spit out<,> the the 
messages that were decontextualised and contextualised and I
did a very very detailed um<,> analysis of the entities and
of<,> the nominal groups which which were
realised here<,> and I was disappointed <#\>In fact at the
beginning of last year I was just about to give up altogether
because the statistics just weren't giving me what I wanted
them to give me and people were saying <quote>well that's that's interesting in itself</quote> <,,>
so I was really in despair when<,> I<,> thought blow this I'll
just pour over the you know put the
results together with the actual text<,> and see
what see what um<,> that does <#\>And it
it it dawned on me that I was <,> I
was analysing in too much detail <#\>I didn't need<,>
to consider every entity in the message<,> at all um but there
was<,> only one entity that was important<,> and um<,> I
called this the the central entity um<,>
so if you would if if you go thr quickly through this this text
extract one<,> you might get a feel for<,> the entities that
have been talked about in the various in various
sections of the text in fact<,> I was able to analyse<,> well segment this whole text ah and
the others in terms of<,> um the kind of entity that was being
talked about and the invasion of the event being talked about
on the here and now<,> of of the speech
situation <#\>So um this this <,> starts
off with<,> the message two hundred and seven <#\>Before
of of immediately before this by the way mum
says to the child <quote>you're a hungry boy aren't
you</quote> so this is<,> a completely new topic they're
starting when the child says <quote>this is a boat that flies
<#\>A boat that flies <#\>Yeah</quote> <#\>And then she says
<quote>Is it a hydroplane</quote> <#\><quote>Yes</quote> said the child says the child <#\>So the child
is making observations about something in the material
situation or setting that's not actually here and now <#\>It
can't possibly really be<,> a um a boat
that flies so it's it's probably a toy<,>
um <#\>I thought at first it might have been you know a
sandwich <O>inaudible and laughter</O> <#\>So he's making
observations about<,> characteristics of an entity<,>
that ah well characteristics he's ah ascribing to this entity and these characteristics
are<,> ah inherent<,> according to him <#\>This is an
imaginary context and it's in this imaginary contexts these
entities are inherent <O>inaudible due to cough</O> so that I
say it's an imaginary context because it because
it can't be an actual<,> boat that flies<,,> <#\>It it it's a toy <O>inaudible</O><,> I presume
<$Z><X> <#\>I thought it might be a picture or a
<O>inaudible</O></X>
<$A> <#\>Um<,> well as it goes through <{><[>you know</[> 
it appears that it is an actual three dimensional object
<$Z><X> <#\><[>sorry</[> </{></X>
 <O>several inaudible exchanges</O> 
<$A> <#\>Okay so the child's made these observations and the
mother is giving him ah a signifier for this this thing this boat that flies and she's
suggesting a couple ah and she actually defines what she means
by<,> hydroplane <#\><quote>A hydroplane is a land ah a plane that lands on the water</quote> <#\>She<,>
um gives him a sort of a generalisation for this object um<,>
and it it goes on like that for a while
um<,,> er er <#\>The child goes on to water and <quote>this is
the boat that flies</quote> <#\><quote>saves people</quote> 
<#\><quote>Saves everyone that's got drowned</quote> <#\>So
then the mother in with<,> an account of a helicopter that
goes up and down the beaches in summer watching out<,> for
people called a rescue helicopter <#\>The child says <quote>oh
that's what mine is</quote> <#\>Well that's how I interpreted
that um<,> <#\>I haven't given you the transcription
conventions but<,> where you have a square bracket with<,> an
empty space in it and a question mark like this<,> it was
completely unintelligible <#\>If there's a word in it that's
what we've thought the word was <#\>Okay so it's uncertain
transcription<,> <#\>And then the mother ah continues on with
the the account of the rescue helicopter
<#\><quote>I think it mainly watches out for sharks but might
also rescue people if they're a long way out from the beach
and in trouble</quote> <#\>And then she says <quote>it's a
good idea isn't it</quote> <,> <#\>Ah the child says
<quote>this is one of them</quote> um<,,> and ah<,> then the
mother says um <quote>where's the pilot</quote> <,> <#\>So
she's<,> entering into a sort of a a 
commentary on on this<,> um situated
object<,,> <#\>Ah the child says <quote>what where ah which is the pilot</quote> and<,> the mother
mishears and but the child has lost
interest at that point and said and says 
<quote>what what do pilots do</quote> 
<#\>So then the talk<,> becomes concerned with<,> um aeroplane
crew<,> and and their jobs<,> <#\>So um
it it becomes as kind of generalisation
<#\><quote>Pilots drive aeroplanes and helicopters <#\>They're
really drivers<,> like captains are <#\>Yes captains are
pilots in charge</quote> etcetera<,> <#\>And that goes on down
to about message two hundred and fifty one where<,> the whole
message was completely unintelligible and<,> the mother says
<#\>Well we find out why it was unintelligible because mother
says <quote>I can't hear what you said because you filled your
mouth full of peanut butter sandwich <#\>It's hard talking to
you when you've got your mouth full isn't it <#\>It's a bit
rough I think</quote> <#\>So ah then presumably<,> the child
swallows his mouthful and repeats his question
<#\><quote>Is is the captain in charge of
the um trees mummy</quote> and the talk goes on in this
generalised way about<,> what what 
captains do until the mother mentions stewards and
stewardesses and the child says <quote>Stewart</quote> and the
mother says <quote>Stewards not Stewart <#\>Steward
<#\>Steward is the man who offers you drinks of coffee and
tea</quote> and the child pipes up and says <quote>and Stewart
is Joanne's<,> um dad</quote> <#\><quote>That's
right</quote> <,,> <#\>So ah then the talk<,> centres around
Stewart as the kind of central entity ah and what Stewart's
role is in ah well his job um and you can see then the child
still has quants wants to get Stewart on
an aeroplane <#\>Just because stewards are on aeroplanes you
don't get Stewart onto an aeroplane <#\><quote>Does he work in
a plane where they print things</quote> he says in two
separate times<,> and mother says <quote>no he works in a
place not a plane <#\>He doesn't work on an
aeroplane</quote> <,> ah <#\>But the child is persisting
<#\><quote>But mummy when he doesn't go to work sometimes does
he go on an aeroplane</quote> <,> and then the mother recounts
um<,,> er a story about when Stewart<,> and presumably
Stewart's wife Helen went on an aeroplane to America coming to
visit<,,> a child here and his family <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>Okay now<,,> that goes on to um two hundred and ninety one
that recount of Stewart's plane trip<,> and then in two ninety
two the mother um<,> introduces another recount this time of
the child's own personal experience of flying on a plane and
um ah it seems that she does this in order to clarify um<,>
the term Stewart and steward to the child before going on
<#\>She couldn't produce a steward in the material situation
or setting which as you know would be the ideal thing to teach 
<O>inaudible</O> as um Malinovski said in <O>inaudible</O>
most important confusion ah to linguistic<,> theory um<,></I>
