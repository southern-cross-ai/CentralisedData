<S2A-003> <2005>
<I><$A> <#\>And welcome to Barcelona where uh we have one minute
and forty seconds to go until the start of Australia's first
group B match in this Olympic tournament<,> <#\>As uh Bruce said
their opponents Puerto Rico <#\>It'll be a very very strong match
for Australia first up<,> <#\>And before we start let's review<,>
other basketball results today <#\>Two games have been held in
the morning session<,,> <#\>Firstly the Commonwealth of
Independent States<,> had a relatively easy win over Venezuela
<#\>The score line of seventy-eight to sixty-four<,> <#\>They led
thirty-four to sixteen at half-time<,> <#\>And then a powerhouse
display from Lithuania over The People's Republic of China<,> in
the second game of the day<,> <#\>Uh they led by twenty points
to five after five minutes <#\>Led fifty-five twenty-six at half-
time<,> and uh finally ran out  win  at one hundred and twelve
to seventy-five <#\>So the C I S defeated Venezuela
<#\>Lithuania<,> defeated China<,,> <#\>And with me Lindsay  Gaze 
<#\>It was a great display from Lithuania and a very early sign
of the  the   form that they're in in this
tournament
<$B> <#\>Well Lithuania's ranked number one in group B<,> <#\>The
C I S would be ranked number two <#\>And then it's anyone's guess
almost to who's three four and five<,> <#\>Uh<,> China would be
ranked number six and uh that <.>w</.> 
 that's   the reason why today's game against Puerto Rico
is so important for us<,,> <#\>Our objective is to finish in the
<.>o</.>  uh  one   two or three spot<,,>
<#\>And I would think<,> that the winner of this game<,> uh will
be favoured to  to   do that unless there's an
upset uh against Lithuania or the C I S<,> in accordance with the
rankings<,,>
<$A> <#\>Australia and Puerto Rico in Olympic competition head
to head <#\>Australia have the advantage <#\>They've played once
<#\>Australia has won once <#\>So head to head Australia over
Puerto Rico in Olympic competition<,,> one nil<,,>
<$B> <#\>In uh world championship competition and other games
it's uh<,,> uh two one <#\>We beat them in the <O>2 syll</O>
Games<,,> <#\>And they beat us in the world championships<,>
<$A> <#\>Referees for this game Mister  Denko Luditch  from
Croatia and Mister  Francisco Feyada  from Spain<,,> <#\>Starting
five for Australia<,> Phil Smythe Andrew  Gaze  Andrew  Flarhov 
Mark  Bradky  and Luke  Longley  and that's the<,,> familiar five
that we're used to seeing<,> <#\>Starting five for Puerto Rico<,>
Ortiz<,> Lopez<,>  Gausay <,>  Rivas <,,> and Rodriguez<,,>
<$B> <#\>Uh two of those have had some uh N B A experience and
the others have all played in the N C double A in the United
States
<$A> <#\>Here's Australia's first match<,,> <#\>The nineteen
ninety-two Barcelona Olympics<,,> <#\>Inside Longley<,> moves
inside and a good move <{><[>and the first basket</[> to
Australia<,>
<$B> <#\><[><O>1 syll</O>  basket </[> </{>
<$A> <#\>Power move in the <O>1 syll</O> from Luke Longley<,>
<#\>And he's gonna be a key in this match and this tournament
<$B> <#\>Well that should help his confidence and uh<,,> <#\>You
know we really need to make a target out of uh Luke but<,> that's
not good news for Australia either<,,>
<$A> <#\>He's got three pointer <,> from Raymond  Gausay  of
Puerto Rico <#\>And they take the lead<,,> <#\>Three points to
two<,> <#\>They've  played just thirty seconds in this first
match<,,> <#\>Inside  Bradky  <#\>Lovely pass from Longley
<#\>Australia regained the lead<,,>
<$B> <#\>Well it didn't take Puerto Rico too long to figure out
what the uh target is <#\>And they gave a little bit too much
help there on Longley to  open up  Bradky <,> <#\>And uh
that's good news for Australia as well <#\>We have  Bradky  and
Longley playing well<,,> <#\>And it'll give them the chance to  uh<,>  to   get running<,> <#\>Uh it is<,,>
Adrian Healey's uh main task to try to develop a running game
<#\>They think that they can win on the board with  Bradky  and
Longley playing up tempo game <#\>It's a good start for us<,>
<$A> <#\>Bradky  picks up his fourth point<,,> <#\>Good feed
inside <#\>So Australia going to their big front line <#\>And it
is a big front line <#\>Luke Longley seven foot two  Bradky  six
ten<,> and  Flarhov <,> six seven<,> but plays bigger than
that<,> <#\>Outside shot from Puerto Rico is missed <#\>Longley
to rebound<,> <#\>Australia leads six points to three<,>
<#\>Eighteen and a half minutes to go in the first half<,,>
<$B> <#\>Incidentally uh Puerto Rico beat Lithuania in a  uh  in an   exhibition match pre-Olympics here  at  one
hundred and one to one hundred<,,> <#\>So that we know that we
gotta very even competition with a lot of talent out there<,,>
<$A> <#\>Scorers so far for Australia Mark  Bradky  with four
Longley with two <#\>Australia is a hundred percent <#\>Three for
three for the field<,,> <#\>And this is Smythe<,,> <#\>Some
perimeter passing <#\>Back inside <#\>Longley at the low post
<#\>Good <.>st</.>   strong   power move again
<#\>And it's in <#\>So he'll get the foul and now a chance for
a three point play <#\>And  Australia going to the big man
inside<,> <#\>He's just completed his first season<,> in the pros
at the N B A with Minnesota<,,> <#\>A somewhat disappointing
season<,> from a statistics point of view but a great<,>
confidence-building and career-building<,> year for him<,> and
the N B A <#\>So Longley at the line<,>  with  a chance to
increase Australia's lead<,,> <#\>Pretty good foul shooter<,,>
<#\>And Australia lead nine to three<,,>
<$B> <#\>That's a big start and with Longley there <#\>He's made
three moves  and  three<,> strong plays two baskets <O>3 syll</O>
to uh Mark  Bradky <,> <#\>It'll be interesting now to see what
uh Puerto Rico does to try to contain that<,> <#\>They have
played some  zone  <#\>They're   They're   
likely  to  zone  uh<,> as they did against Lithuania for some
part of the time<,,> and uh<,> that'll test er Australia's
perimeter shooting <#\>But with Smythe and Andrew  Gaze  out
there<,,> Leroy Loggins to add to that as well<,,> <#\>And I
don't think zone should worry us too much<,,>
<$A>  Flarhov   Bradky   Gaze  cuts but  Bradky  takes it to the
basket<,> <#\>Another strong move so<,,> we've said that
Australia have got to play power basketball and they certainly
have in the first two and a half minutes <#\>And the first time-
out of the match<,,> <#\>Seventeen fifty to go<,> in the first
half and a great eight point lead to Australia <#\>Eleven points
to three<,,>
<$B> <#\>Well that <#\>You'll   You   couldn't
want a better start than that uh if uh<,> uh it is essential for
us to play some strong defence <#\>We've been able to contain<,>
Puerto Rico in the early stages and uh<,> making a target out
of<,> Mark  Bradky  and Luke Longley<,> is  uh
 is   really the formula that uh Adrian Healey has wanted
to develop<,,> <#\>And uh if they can keep going like that well
er we're in for a good tournament<,,>
<$A> <#\>So Austra   Australia   off to a great
start <#\>The scoring six points to  Bradky  five to Longley
<#\>So the two big men doing all of the damage inside and still
Australia<,> <.>on</.>  one   hundred percent
shooting record <#\>They are five for five from the field<,,>
<#\>And the scorer for<,> Puerto Rico Raymond  Gausay  with
three<,,> <#\>And that is the team total<,> <#\>Eleven to three
and a great start <#\>There's a long way to go though in this
match <#\>There's seventeen minutes and fifty seconds in the
first half<,,>
<$B> <#\>The uh Puerto Rican coach Victor<,>  Lagas  is a former
national player <#\>He has uh many many years of experience at
the international level<,,> <#\>And uh<,,> he would have been
trying to solve the problems with the big men on that last time-
out<,,> <#\>Look  for a change of defence next time down the
floor<,,>
<$A> <#\>To inbound the ball is Jerome  Mincey  for Puerto Rico
<#\>Australia now  press up <,,> <#\>Put  pressure on the ball
carrier <#\>They double<,> <#\>Leave someone loose
<#\>Inside<,,> <#\>Ortiz<,,> <#\>Nice move<,,> <#\>Double 
team   looked  good but a quick outlet pass allowed Puerto Rico
to get an easy two points <#\>Scoreline though still Australia 
by six eleven points to five<,,> <#\>This is  Flarhov  moving
again<,,> <#\>Foul is called<,,> <#\>And it's called on
Frederico Lopez of Puerto Rico<,>  for  the  aside  ball to
Australia<,> <#\>Or is it going to be called on  Mincey  <,,>
<#\>Foul is on Jerome  Mincey <,,> <#\>The Puerto Rico two team
fouls Australia<,> none as yet<,> <#\>So it's been a great
opening<,,> <#\>Seventeen an  minutes  and  
twenty-three seconds to go in this first half <#\>Australia's
first outing<,,> at these Olympic Games trying to improve on
their best ever fourth performance achieved at Seoul <#\>Inside
<$B> <#\><{><[>Great pass</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Lovely</[> </{> <#\>Beautiful <#\>Behind the back
<{><[>pass</[> Longley<,> to  Bradky  for the first slam dunk of
the match<,> and Australia again up by eight<,,>
<$B> <#\><[><O>1 syll</O></[> </{>
<$B> <#\>Well what a great start for Longley that uh almost every
time he handles the ball something good comes out of it<,> either
a basket or a pass <#\>That was a tremendous<,,> move from
him<,,> <#\>The w   The worry   that uh
Australia has is that  uh  is the   one on one
play <#\>Here's the situation here<,> which uh<,,> that 
 that's   uh maybe one of the most uh<,> worrying aspects
of our   of our   game that the opposition is
inclined to spread the defence play one on one<,,> and in that
situation we could have some problems <#\>The  uh<,>
 The   Puerto Ricans are<,,> expert at the one on one
game<,,> <#\>Draw some help they'll dish it and they can shoot
from the outside<,,>
<$A> <#\>This is Juan  Rivas  on the line for Puerto Rico<,,>
<#\>One of their big front-line players at <,,>six nine and a
veteran<,> of the Puerto Rican side <#\>And he makes<,> them
both<,>
<$B> <#\><O>1 syll</O> <{><[> Rivas  spent some</[> time with the
Celtics so uh<,> he's experienced and he knows to handle that one
on one game as well<,>
<$A> <#\><[><O>2 syll</O></[> </{>
<$A> <#\>Australia lead Puerto Rico thirteen points to six
<#\>Sixteen and three quarter minutes to go in the first
half<,,> <#\>Great performance<,,> by Australia early on but
a offensive foul called on Mark  Bradky 
who was doing some heavy posting<,> against uh Frederico Lopez
<#\>He got caught<,> <#\>And uh so Australia's<,> now two team
fouls <#\>Puerto Rico with three<,,> <#\>And a turnover <#\>Now
see  Puerto Rico<,> start their half  court offence <,,>
<#\>Lopez being picked up here by Smythe<,> <#\>Out on  the
corner  Gausay  <#\>In again <#\>Rivas   at  the post and fouled
by Longley on the  fake <,> <#\>No<,,>
<$B> <#\>Just lifted his <O>1 syll</O> <{><[><O>2 syll</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[> He did </[> </{>
<$B> <#\>He turned <#\>He wanted to go up and he saw the big arms
of Luke Longley there intimidating him and it was too late for
him to  uh<,>  to   withdraw the shot<,,>
<$A> <#\>Still calling to the referee about the foul before the
violation but a turnover this time  to  Puerto Rico <#\>Inside
Longley<,,> <#\>One of the advantages is that of his <#\>He can
<.> f </.>  kick the ball back out to Smythe <#\>His first
shot of the match is missed<,,> <#\>Australia still lead though
by seven <#\>Thirteen points to six<,,> <#\><{><[>Good crowd</[> 
in attendance here at Barcelona today<,>
<$B> <[><O>1 syll</O></[> </{>
<$A> <#\>Stadium about three quarters full <#\>It holds twelve
and a half thousand<,> <#\>As Puerto Rico try to take it inside
and Andrew  Flarhov <,,> commits the foul is caught for it and
acknowledges it<,,> <#\>And that's his first personal<,,>
<$B> <#\>I'd encourage Phil Smythe <#\>Although he took that
outside shot and it was uh off the mark that uh<,> Phil has been
looking to shoot more at practice in the time here at
Barcelona<,> <#\>And I think that if he can tune in on some of
those it'll be a great help  for them  <O>audience cheers</O>
<$A> <#\>Shot is out<,,> <#\>Close shot that time from Lopez<,,>
<#\>Australia all set up again <#\>This is  Flarhov <,,> 
<#\>Trying  to bounce one through the key but<,> some traffic
there<,,> <#\>Australia will retain possession <#\>And it's a
side ball <#\>Flarhov  will  inbound <,>
<$B> <#\>Bit ambitious there although uh it's  it   uh indicates<,,> Australia's desire to keep the
game and the tempo running<,,>
<$A> <#\>Hmm<,> <#\>Well Smythe<,> commits a turnover<,,>
<#\>Can't recall him being caught for<,> double dribble for a
long long time at this level<,,> <#\>So now
<$B> <#\>Well you'll see some uh unusual officiating in this
competition er that er particular move there<,,> uh was repeated
many times in the early game this morning<,,> and was never
called<,,>
<$A> <#\>Good defence from Longley but<,> I think he's committed
a foul<,,> <#\>Muscling in very very strong on Juan  Rivas <,>
<#\>Rivas  was pushing him and edging him towards the basket
<#\>A slight fake<,,>
<$B> <#\>Well he got called for the chop there <#\>I <.>
th </.>   er it's a bit disappointing for Luke because
uh<,> he had good position<,> <#\>But he had to go to the  reach 
<#\>And uh  you  only need to hold his ground there and there's
nowhere that uh<,> Lopez could have gone
<$A> <#\>So<,,> second personal foul on Luke Longley <#\>And 
Rivas  at the line<,,> <#\>Has just one point in the match so
far <#\>Still Australia lead though by seven</I>
