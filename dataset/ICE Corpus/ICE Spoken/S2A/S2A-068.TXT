<S2A-068> <2028>
<I><$A>   <#\>Your Worship ah I'll address my submissions in
ah<,,> a number of ways <#\>Firstly<,> on any view of the
evidence<,> the prosecution have not established beyond
reasonable doubt the charge as particularised<,> and I'd ask
Your Worship to have particular regard to the letter<,>
setting out the particulars dated the eleventh of November
nineteen ninety two<,,> <#\>Does Your Worship have a copy of
that letter 
<$B> <#\>Yes I think I have<,,> from the police service
<$A> <#\>If Your Worship also has the other letter from the
police services well I'll come to that in a minute
 <{><[>but </[> the one I'm after is the eleventh of November
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm </[></{>
     <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>The particulars set forth in that letter are the
vehicle was stopped at a red traffic co  control   light at the intersection of Mournedral
Terrace and Horne Road <#\> <{1><[1>Well </[1> that seems to be
common ground between all the witnesses <{2><[2>except</[2>
perhaps<,,> Mr Watts who thought there was a pedestrian
crossing but <{3><[3><,></[3> I  I   don't
think Your Worship would have any difficulty accepting that it
was stopped at the intersection of Horne Road and Mournedral
Terrace  
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm </[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\>Yeah<,>
<$A> <#\>The contentious matter is that the vehicle
accelerated to a speed of eighty two kilometres an hour and a
finding will be necessary on that<,> but there's no doubt on
any of the evidence<,> that the next particular hasn't been
established <#\>That is that the vehicle maintained the speed
for a distance of two hundred metres<,,> because at its
highest the police evidence was that the vehicle travelled at
eighty two kilometres an hour between Janel Street and Valace
Street <#\>The agreed distance of which was ninety five point
five metres<,,> <#\> <{><[>The </[>
<$B> <#\><[>How </[></{> do you say that makes it fatal to
the police case if  if   it was proven that
he could accelerate to eighty two that he didn't maintain a
speed of ninety  ah  over a distance   of
ninety five point five <{><[>metres</[>
<$A> <#\><[>The</[></{>  the   charge as
particularised is you accelerated to eighty
two<{><[><,></[> you maintained that speed for a distance
of two hundred metres
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>He  he's   charged with ah exceeding
the speed limit and it's sixty ks in a ah
<$A> <#\>But once particulars have been given <,,> the
prosecution's bound by those particulars unless they seek to
amend<,,> and there's full court authority for that in the
decision of <,> McKlintock and Nofgy <,,> which is reported
in nineteen thirty six<,> state reports Queensland page
seventy three <#\>And I particularly refer Your Worship<,> to
the judgement of Mr Justice Henchman at page seventy nine and
the judgement of Mr Justice Hart at pages eighty five to
eighty six<,,> which is even if you're not obliged to give
particulars what you do  once you do   you're
bound by those particulars and  that case of
McKlintock and Nofgy was a case of alleged ill-treatment of a
child<,> and the<,> prosecution provided particulars of one
incident of alleged ill-treatment and then sought to lead
evidence of other ill-treatment <#\>What the  what
the   full court says was no once you've particularised
as to the one alleged incident you have to prove it<,> and my
first submission in this case is once it's been alleged<,>
that the vehicle has travelled at a given speed for a given
distance that has to be proved <#\>If it's not proved<,> the
complaint ought to be dismissed <#\>If one then retreats from
that proposition back a step and say well if you achieved the
speed at any point on the road you've committed the offence<,>
then in my submission you would have a reasonable doubt as to
two matters which are fundamental to the police case<,>
<#\>Even if you accept the police officer and the transport
officer's evidence on all matters of conflict<,,> and that
is<,> <#\>The two matters as to which you'd have a reasonable
doubt is that the vehicle could maintain the speed of eighty
two kilometres an hour for the distance between Janel Street
and Valace Street having regard to the<,> topography of the
road<,,> and that the vehicle could corner at seventy
kilometres an hour<,,> cos those were the two matters<,> that
ah the police officer was<,> definite about and one must bear
in mind<,> that the evidence of the transport officer was that
the cornering action was a smooth one<,,> not as I think Mr
Bleakly described as a sharp and sudden braking manoeuvre
necessary to get around at a certain speed<,> <#\>In my
submission you would have a reasonable doubt and that's really
all that's necessary in this case <#\>It's not for<,> Mr
McGregor to prove that he wasn't speeding<,> that those two
matters can be established on the evidence <#\>And one  when   one has regard to the particulars
again and this time I'm referring to the second letter<,> in
November <#\>The police have said that the intersection
nearest which<,> the offence occurred was Valace Street<,,>
<#\>This is the letter of the twenty sixth of November<,>
point five<,,> <#\>For you to accept their evidence you have
to accept that this semi-trailer was travelling at eighty two
kilometres an hour in Valace at  ah  at or
near   Valace Street which on ah the laws of physics
apparently is impossible if one wants to get around the corner
without turning the vehicle over<,,> <#\>In my submission
Your Worship you're bound to act<,> on uncontradicted evidence
if<,> that evidence is credible and in this case the
uncontradicted evidence is<,> that the weight of Mr McGregor's
vehicle was eighteen tonnes that on the date in question he
was carrying a load of twenty three tonnes and that his
vehicle's engine<,> produced ah three hundred fifty six horse
power at twenty one hundred revs <#\>So those matters are
undisputed uncontradicted and must be accepted in my
submission<,>   
<$B> <#\>Well part of those are uncontradicted<,> <#\>Part of
those facts are uncontradicted<,,>
<$A> <#\>I'm sorry Your Worship I wasn't aware that any of
those 
<$B> <#\>Yeah there are<,> <#\>There are <#\>There's  there's   no definite evidence as to the weight that
the vehicle was carrying  <{1><[1>and I </[1> could accept eith  either   version couldn't I <#\><{2><[2>I've</[2>  I   could accept the fact that
eith  it   was loaded or it wasn't 
<$A> <#\><[1>Well Mr McGregor </[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mr</[2></{2>
     <#\>Well it wasn't put to him that it was unloaded<,>
<#\>Mr McGregor gave evidence that it was carrying twenty
three tonnes of soft drink cans<,,> neither the police officer
nor the transport officer inspected it  the
load   and it was never put to him<,> that is to Mr
McGregor<,> that it was unloaded <#\>The only time that the
question of loading or unloading came up was<,> when my friend
was cross-examining Mr Bleakly to see whether the<,> speed at
which the vehicle could take the corner would be affected if
the vehicle was unloaded<,> but even when you have regard to
that evidence<,,> it still couldn't have gone around the
corner at seventy kilometres an hour<,> <#\>I think Mr Bleakly
conceded a further five kilometres to his calculations<,,>
<#\>But certainly in my submission the weight of the vehicle
the weight of the load and the specifications of the vehicle
were never challenged<,,> <#\>My fre  friend   can correct me on that if he  if
he   can point to any evidence<,,> <#\>In my submission
if you have regard to the facts that I've just referred to
there must be a reasonable doubt <#\>That is ignoring all the
contentious evidence as to whether cars were in front whether
he stopped at Hamilton Road whether he had a conversation with
the police and what it was about <#\>You can ignore all
that<,> <#\>There must be a doubt as to whether the offence
was committed<,> and it's a reasonable doubt having regard to
the  the   evidence which has been read<,,>
<#\>When one adds on top of those inescapable facts<,> the
other evidence<,> then in my submission there can be no other
conclusion other than there is a reasonable doubt <#\>That is
if there was a vehicle in front of Mr McGregor's vehicle<,,>
that must've affected the situation and the police officer
says there wasn't <#\>Mr Watts says you couldn't tell because
of the respective heights of the two vehicles <#\>If there's a
reasonable doubt as to whether there's a car in front of Mr
McGregor's vehicle<,> that also must point in my submission
to<,> a finding of not guilty<,> <#\>Having a regard to the
time of the day at which the offence is alleged to have
occurred there must be a reasonable doubt<,> as to whether
there were other cars on the road <#\>Indeed Mr Watts said
that there were vehicles in the vicinity of the school that is
the Ashbury school<,,> and the police officer wrote on the
back of the ticket <quote>light to moderate traffic</quote> <,>
yet somehow conveniently there was never another car in front
of Mr McGregor's vehicle <#\>Again Mr McGregor doesn't have to
prove all of these matters <#\>If there's a reasonable doubt
that there were vehicles turning into schools et cetera at
that time of the day that's sufficient for a finding of not
guilty and Your Worship using common sense at quarter to three
in the afternoon near a state school<,> there is traffic<,,>
<#\>Having ah regard to the<,> other matter of dispute that is
the degree of gradient of the road<,> in my submission you'd
accept the evidence of Mr Bleakly as opposed to the other
evidence being conceded to be only estimates<,> whereas Mr er
Bleakly has gone to some trouble to determine what the
gradient actually was<,,> <#\>The conversation which my
ler  which my friend   ah<,> pressed ah Mr McGregor
about which took place when he was intercepted is in my
submission irrelevant to the issue which Your Worship has to
find<,> that is whether the charge as particularised has been
proved <#\>For this reason<,> put at its highest<,> if the
police evidence is accepted Mr McGregor didn't know what speed
he was doing<,,> <#\>It's certainly not contended that he
admitted he was doing eighty two kilometres an hour and unless
one develops a new proposition of law that silence equals
confession<,> the conversation's irrelevant to the charge as
pleaded <#\>That is simply because some one doesn't say
<quote>you're wrong <#\>I wasn't doing eighty two kilometres
an hour</quote> is it  is tantamount   to
admission of guilt<,> <#\>It can't be relevant to the issue
<#\>All it can be relevant to is as to whether you prefer the
evidence of the police or the evidence of Mr McGregor<,>
having regard to his demeanour and the fact that he didn't
deny it at the side of the road<,> <#\>In my submission every
critical fact necessary<,,> to give rise to a reasonable doubt
comes from the mouths of the prosecution's witnesses <#\>That
is the evidence that there may have been car  a
car   in front of Mr McGregor's vehicle comes from the
mouth of Mr Watts<,,> <#\>The fact that ah there may have
been vehicles ah moving ah into the  ah
 the   school comes from the mouth of Mr Watts <#\>The
fact that he took the corner at the bottom of the hill in a
smooth manner<,> comes from I  I   think ah
both the police officer and Mr Watts <#\>I'm not ah sure about
the police officer but ah he didn't certainly describe any
violent<,> braking and ah swerving<,,> <#\>If one then<,,>
moves to the evidence of Mr Bleakly<,> in my submission Your
Worship would have no hesitation in accepting that evidence<,>
based as it is on complete independence<,,> and on completely
objective data<,,> <#\>That is one can look at the corner<,>
and by a ah mathematical formula say that it is not possible
to go around that corner at seventy kilometres an hour<,,> and
it is not possible having regard to the distances involved and
the type of vehicle to travel at a speed of eighty two
kilometres an hour at the point the police says he was
travelling and get around the corner <#\>Simply not physically
possible<,> <#\>One is then left with this possible
conclusion<,> that he accelerated from the lights to eighty
two kilometres an hour and then almost straight away commenced
braking to go around the corner smoothly<,,> <#\>Now if one
puts aside<,> the legal conclusion that that particular
finding doesn't establish the charge as particularised<,,> one
puts that aside and approaches it simply from the matter of
common sense</I>
