<S2A-006> <2011>
<&>SAMPLE STARTS AT ABOUT 273 ON TAPE COUNTER</&>
<I><$A> <#\>Uh twenty-one to fourteen Dandenong <#\>The <?>tip-
off</?> uh will will be <#\>Days jumping against Feejant
<#\>Feejant wins it but the uh control with Dandenong <#\>Gubbles
who got them off to a great start shooting-wise as Days scores
her first points of the night would you believe <#\>And that
shows just what a good good team performance it's been from uh
the Rangers <#\>And Days has looked after the rebounding of the
defensive work <#\>The others have done the scoring <#\>As Murphy
makes two <#\>She's got double figures now for Canberra
<#\><O>inaudible</O> really come up big in this half <#\>Feejant
<#\><?>Call</?> for the foul <#\>Second personal foul on Rene
Feejant <#\><?>Both way with more than</?> two fouls so far in
the game
<$B> <#\>And Rene Feejant coming over the hands of Samantha
Thornton
<$A> <#\>So Thornton at the line <#\>She has seven points for the
match <#\><?>Two from two from</?> the line so far tonight <#\>So
uh points not as easy to come by so far in this second half
<#\>Twenty-two points the lead for Dandenong <#\>Dyke <#\>Out to
Smith for three <#\>Oh and with a bit o' luck <?>needs to go</?>
Canberra's way <#\>Now that's the first <O>inaudible</O> three
point range <#\><O>inaudible</O> McConnell <O>inaudible</O>
<?>three point shoes</?> <O>inaudible</O> for Canberra Capitals
<$B> <#\>Again Dandenong Rangers work the ball very well around
the key <#\>Eight seconds left on the shot clock as Narelle
McConnell fields that ball
<$A> <#\>Oh
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> break opportunity
<$A> <#\>No-one in support
<$B> <#\>No <#\>All green shre- shirts down in front of
<?>'em</?> down the court
<$A> <#\>Just too many Dandenong players swarming all over the
top of McConnell
<$B> <#\>You have the feeling that Canberra are really forcing
their play trying to make something happen and um really feeling
frustrated and desperate at this stage of the game
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>And that really was desperate play from McMahon
undisciplined really as she failed Regina Days there
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> clearly that was a a foul by uh Lisa
McMahon <#\>Body and hands all over Regina Days <#\>Good <?>hand
to</?> Tracy Dyke
<$A> <#\>Dyke
<$A> <#\>McConnell <#\>Foul on Browning and i- catching the arm
of Narelle McConnell <#\>Second personal foul on uh Tracy
Browning <#\>No doubt about that one either called by Ray Hunt
<$B> <#\>And good change of direction by Narelle McConnell to try
and get out of the path of uh Tracy Bow- Browning who was clearly
in front of her and didn't make the move across as Narelle moved
stepped a- across
<$A> <#\>Connell for her first points in the second half <#\>'T's
five points so far in the match <#\>Seventy-eight percent three
free throw <?>shoot of</?> this season <#\>And they need to make
every post a winner the Capitals if they get to get back into the
game <#\>Improved their position of half time by nine points
<#\>Still plenty of time <#\>Nine twenty-eight <#\>Browning makes
two <#\>Well Jerry Lee said during the time-out they weren't
shooting as well from the field <#\>That was true <#\>But
Browning now back in the game <#\>Top <?>scorer for</?> the match
with seventeen points <#\>McMahon <#\><?>Did</?> they look at the
basket just trying to woo it in
<$B> <#\>And again
<$B> <#\>And again that's indicative of what I was saying earlier
where the Canberra girls are really just putting their head down
and driving through <#\>And they're not looking at where the
defensive players are <#\>And that's why those charges have been
coming to Canberra so far in this game
<$A> <#\><O>Name</O> sits down and Murphy back on the court after
a short break <#\>Top scorer in the competition this season
averaging seventeen point six games points per match <#\>She has
fifteen already tonight <#\>Dyke <#\>Out to McMahon
<$B> <#\>Narelle McConnell actually with uh another two points
there
<$A> <#\>Oh sorry <#\>McConnell
<$A> <#\>If they can get it under double figures <#\>They've got
a a good number of travelling fans here tonight Canberra to see
them in their first W M B L final <#\>I'm sure they'd be roaring
<#\>And you wouldn't discount them <#\>Browning misses <#\>Oh
<O>inaudible</O> <#\><?>She'd have grabbed</?> that on her chest
that rebound Tominac and she looks skyward <quote><#\>How did I
miss that</quote> 
<$B> <#\>Just a little over energetic there <#\>I think she's
anticipating having the Dandenong playing <?>to their back</?>
and um couldn't believe that uh she had an open open range on
that
<$A> <#\>'T's Browning <O>inaudible</O> Days <#\>Triple-teaming
her <#\><?>Good</?> ball movement and Gubbles is three for three
<#\>And there's the offensive <?>ball</?> from Regina Days
<$B> <#\>She's just dominating on the <?>ball at</?> both ends
uh so far in the game Regina Days <#\>And again that's where it's
really hurt Canberra to see Tracy Dyke foul Regina Days sending
her to the line for another two points two uh foul shots <#\>But
that's where it's really hurt Canberra not having Rene Feejant
uh up to fitness <#\>And they're really missing her in the inside
<?>paint</?> area particularly
<$A> <#\>Yeah she's just not up to a full game <#\>She played uh
a few minutes last week against Melbourne <#\>Few more minutes
already she's played tonight <#\>Hope she'll come back towards
the end of the game <#\>Regina Days <#\>Two for three from the
line tonight <#\><O>inaudible</O> Days <#\>But the rebound was
from Sam Thornton <#\>An important one <#\>They can stretch the
<?>lead</?> at fifteen again here <#\>Thornton <?>forced deep</?>
by Smith <#\>And the rebound from Murphy
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> Murphy keeps shooting like that as she
has in this second half it's not beyond Canberra Capitals at all
to get back in this game
<$A> <#\>Nineteen points is the top score in the match now
<#\>Murphy <#\>And they're shooting at forty-eight percent in
this second half compared to thirty-one in the first
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><?>And enters through the line</?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
go Capitals <#\>The lead now just seven for Dandenong <#\>They've
cut it from twenty-one at half time Jerry Lee's team <#\>And in
between time-out when Lee told them <#\>No fouls 'cos you're in
the bonus <#\>They haven't given away one <#\>Gubbles knocks down
two points <#\>She has seventeen in the match <#\>Murphy
<?>and</?> Days with desperation on her face looking to guard
with all her might against her <#\>Feejant has it stripped away
by Thornton
<$B> <#\>And it's from really been Michelle Gubbles for Dandenong
that's come up with the uh the the big two points when Dandenong
had needed it in this game <O>inaudible</O> <?>three point
play</?>
<$A> <#\>And well spotted by Sharon McCola <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<#\>Free throw <#\>So So this is the three point opportunity
<#\>Thornton <#\>Foul on Gubbles <#\>And this is seventeen fouls
now on Dandenong in this half <#\>So into the bonus <#\>Their
next team foul <#\>Six minutes left in the game <#\>Dandenong by
eleven <#\>Oh long range <#\>Comes up short McConnell
<$B> Lisa McMahon dives on the ball to try and save that for
Canberra Capitals and rewarded with a uh jump ball against Regina
Days if you can call that a reward <O>laughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Surprisingly Days wins it <#\>Days <O>inaudible</O>
<?>about</?> taking on Feejant <#\>Gubbles <#\>Offensive foul
spotted by Ray Hunt <#\>And she sort of wrapped 'er arm around
uh McConnell there for some reason <#\>She looked like she got
passed 'er
<$B> <#\>Yeah it's really <#\>I think that uh there must have
been a bit of body blows prior to that <#\>And really that was
a frustration foul <#\>Michelle Gubbles clearly had no need
<#\>She was past 'er as you say to have reached 'er arm back
there
<$A> <#\>So eighteen fouls at least <#\>McMahon looking to drive
in but off the ball <#\>The foul on Tominac just got overzealous
there and <?>her</?> pushing and shoving <#\>The referees really
have to have eyes in the back of their head tonight
<$B> <#\>They really have because uh there's been a lot of body
uh contact in this game and uh you really have to c- have to stay
on top of the game like that to not let it get uh unduly out of
control <#\>the referees doing a good job
<$A> <#\>Days <?>driving</?> getting 'er own rebound and foul by
McMahon <#\>No continuation so the basket doesn't count
<$B> <#\>But again we <O>inaudible</O> <?>Regina</?> Days
<#\>She's driven in to the key there with three Canberra Capitals
players in a line <#\>And we've seen uh Regina hold her momentum
and almost uh dive sideways to to get that basket
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> shooting <?>that</?> well from the line
<#\><?>'T's two from five</?> <#\>Good defence coming there from
Thornton <#\>Tominac got the rebound <?>though in</?> the basket
<$B> <#\>Yes that was brilliant play by Kate Tominac underneath
the basket
<$A> <#\>So it's under double figures the lead to Dandenong
<#\>Nine points in front <#\>Looking to keep a buffer between
them and the Capitals inside the last five minutes <#\>Gubbles
<O>inaudible</O> <#\><O>inaudible</O> forces a jump ball
<$B> <#\>Good <?>help</?> defence then by Linda Smith <#\>No
Feejant was uh caught behind Lucille Hamilton <#\>So that was uh
good smart play to help out then
<$A> <#\>Dandenong <?>with</?> a height advantage here <#\>But
the ball goes to Tominac <#\>Gubbles has to be careful <#\>Well
it's down to uh seven points the difference again <#\>Fourteen
points have been made up so far by the Capitals in sixteen
minutes of basketball <#\><?>Turn around jumps off is forced</?>
off the mark by McMahon
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> the little <?>rush</?> shot then by
Tracy Browning <O>inaudible</O> she was playing for the foul
rather than concentrating on the shot <#\>Good save by Linda
Smith and unfortunately <?>struck</?> to the hand of Regina Days
and Dandenong off and running
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <#\>Feejant the rebound
<#\><O>inaudible</O> here with a smart shot <#\>And she really
rushed in there to get the ball back <#\>Murphy disappointed at
not knocking the two points down I think
<$B> <#\>Yes you you often see that happen where a player has
been unsuccessful in uh making an offensive <?>move</?> and in
frustration they make a foul immediately after particularly on
rebound
<$A> <#\>So
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> only shooting it fifty percent from the
line Sam Thornton tonight <#\>And she went away very disappointed
not to uh get both those
<$B> <#\>Rene Feejant saying that she felt that Regina Days had
clearly hit that ball out of court then but uh the referee's
saying both had players had a hand to it <#\>So we see a jump
ball
<$A> <#\><?>McCola</?> <O>inaudible</O> to McMahon for Canberra
<#\>Feejant has the height advantage here but Days has great
spring in those legs <#\>Hamilton wants to try and give it back
to Days <#\>She loses Smith <#\>Thornton over the top knocking
the ball out of court
<$B> <#\>And really Linda uh Smith really up on defence <#\>And
Lucille Hamilton has to be able to to stand straight and uh
<O>inaudible</O> <?>accentuating</?> that back to the referee who
decided at that time to leave it as a no call
<$A> <#\><?>Change</?> <O>inaudible</O> by Jerry Lee
<#\><O>inaudible</O> for Feejant <#\>Three twenty-five left in
the semi-final <#\>Canberra down by eight <#\>Foul on Thornton
<$B> <#\><?>Reece</?> will send Capitals to the line for one
and one <#\>Eight points the difference and uh young Narelle
McConnell just getting some uh last minute advice from Jerry Lee
<#\>Well I think they'd be looking for her to to be looking at
that three-point shot because uh they're still in touch here
Canberra <#\>There's still three and a half minutes remaining
<$A> <#\>Jody Murphy <#\>Now she has twenty-one points in the
match and the lead is down to six
<$B> <#\>And Jody Murphy only averaging nine points last season
so <?>what</?> season she's <?>having really</?> taking on the
mantle of uh <?>top scoring the league</?>
<$A><#\>Days had a look <#\>And Dyke was just too tall
<#\>They're the leading <O>inaudible</O> in the competition
Canberra <#\>And an important block there <?>with under</?> three
minutes to go <#\><O>inaudible</O> cut the lead here to four
points <#\>Murphy against Thornton <#\>Gets some help from
Hamilton <#\>Canberra keep the possession <#\>Nineteen seconds
left on the shot clock <#\>Smith wants some movement from 'er
team
<$B> <#\>Nice pass to Narelle McConnell <#\>And unfortunately
<?>another</?> <O>inaudible</O> <#\>And a foul <#\>We see
Samantha Thornton walks the distance to the other end of the
<?>court</?> for a one and one shot
<$A> <#\>And that's four personal fouls on Jody Murphy <#\>Two
from <?>five</?> attempts from the <O>inaudible</O> <#\>So that's
an important basket from her
<$B> <#\><?>Watch</?> Jerry Lee in that time-out asking his uh
his players to really take the gamble on the passes try and get
that uh steal get that fast break and uh help out and be aware
in <?>defence</?></I>
