<I><$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> believe uhm the Aboriginal Health

<O>8 syll</O> <#\>We also <O>2 syll</O> Aboriginal Deaths in Custody <O>2
syll</O> Redfern Legal Centre for the last three years
<#\><O>inaudible</O> just a little bit about the work I've got in the
past <#\>Uhm <,,> I'm going to talk about domestic violence
today <,,> but rather  than - I'm not gonna <O>8 syll</O> or
anything like that <#\>I thought I'd <,,> just talk about <,,>
how we deal with <,,> domestic violence in our local court
<,,> and then if you wanna ask any questions <O>4 syll</O> <,,>
second part of it if there's time for questions later <#\>Or ask
the questions as we <,,> talk <O>dozen syll</O> <#\>Is that OK with
people <#\><O>2 syll</O> can expect anything <,,> new or <,,>
<O>laugh</O> <#\>Uhm well what <,> what I'll talk about is <,> as I
said how we deal with domestic violence in our local Court at
Redfern <#\>Uhm <,,> for the past three years at Redfern Local
Court we've had a thing called the Women's Domestic Violence
Court Assistance Scheme <,,> the WDVCAS <#\>It's a very very <,>
long name but we haven't figured out a better way to shorten
it <#\>Uhm <,> and what it is it's a <,> an attempt to try and
deal with domestic violence in a holistic <,,> way <#\>And <,,>
by holistic I mean holistic from the point of view of the
woman experiencing domestic violence <#\>And it's basically <,>
a
scheme a feminist scheme <#\>Uhm and I'll go into a bit more
detail <O>2 syll</O> how it operates <#\>But <,,> what what was
happening at Redfern Court is that when there were changes in
domestic violence legislation a few years ago <,,> the changes
were all very well put but still there are a lot of women who
are experiencing the same old problems and then they were
trying to get assistance from the  or from the police <#\>So <,>
the local <,> Domestic Violence Committee got together and
said <quote>How can we improve <,,> services for women who were
applying for restraining orders <,,> and <,> deal with the
other problems of their experiences <,> because they're
obviously just as important</quote> <#\>So they got together the idea
of
having a scheme a support scheme <,,> uhm <,,> which was <,,>
a new idea <,,> at the time <#\>And the scheme involves <,,>
twenty at the moment twenty local organisations community
organisations health <,> centres legal centres <,> uhm
<,,> variety of different other <,> organisations <#\>And
they get together and <,,> a solicitor and two support
workers will attend Redfern Court on every Wednesday <,,>
which is when all domestic violence matters are listed in
Court <,> and <,> will assist the woman through the legal
process <,,> and then <,,> also assist her with all of her
other needs <,> financial housing <,,> uhm emotional support
counselling <,,> a whole range of her needs because basically
it's fairer <#\>And if you don't deal with all of those problems
together it's almost useless <#\>You just give 'em a little <O>1
syll</O> piece of paper and say <quote>Go off and <,> sort your life
out</quote> <#\>And uhm <,> that was the reason we found that the <O>2
syll</O> were <,> pursuing the  case because they weren't getting
that <,,> range of support that they need to deal with all of
their problems <#\>Uhm <,,> so <,,> I'll just sort of go
through a little bit <,,> uhm <,> hoping that I've sort of
given recently on the scheme which is basically to try and
promote it <,> all over the state because ideally what Redfern
would like to see is these kinds of schemes set up all over
the <,,> the state <#\>Uhm <,,> as I said our our specific
objectives are to assist women in a holistic way to stop
violence <O>5 syll</O> not just by legal attention but by providing
access to a support system <O>9 syll</O> financial housing <,,>
emotional support and counselling and other legal problems
<#\>It's based on a feminist philosophy <#\>It aims to empower
women
by giving them more choices <,,> enhances those who <O>4 syll</O>
community by assisting them <O>6 syll</O> change <#\>And it also as
an
effect of that assists by <,> coordinating all of the services
that are available for women in the local area <#\>Uhm <,,> we
believe that the scheme's working and I'll talk a bit more
about how we evaluated it a couple of years ago <O>2 syll</O>
results <O>4 syll</O> <#\>Uhm <,,> well if there's anyone ever
heard of the National Strategy on Violence Against Women <#\>Mm
it's a <,,> uhm group called <,,> well there a was thing
called the National Strategy on Violence Against Women which
couple was put out a couple of years ago by a particular group
it was set up by the Commonwealth Government <#\>And it outlines
a whole series of recommendations for dealing with violence
against women not just domestic violence but all forms of
other violence against women <#\>And uh <,,> one of the things
that they or one of the objectives they use to ensure that all
women escaping violence have immediate access to police
intervention and legal protection and to prioritise safety for
the woman safe shelter confidential services <,> and in the
longer term resources needed to live independently free from
violence <#\>And one of the big problems has always been <,,> as
I said earlier that uhm <,,> whilst there's a lot of emphasis
placed on legal intervention the longer term resources are
often ignored and that's where you get the real problem uhm
<,,> because as long as you <,,> uhm as long as women are
still vulnerable to violence there's no chance of improvement
<#\>Least that's how <,> we see it at Redfern <#\>Uhm
<,,>
what we do <,,> it's the way this scheme assists women is that
uhm <,,> in a number of ways we assist them in dealing with
<,,> in their dealing with police <,> we might be able to<O>7
syll</O> generally to improve police responses to violence <,,>
<#\>We provide the woman with the support of trained community
workers and solicitors <#\>All of the workers on our scheme are
trained <,,> uhm <,,> before <,> they start working on the
scheme <#\>And they're trained in <,,> certain the philosophy
that we've adopted and <,> i- to respond in a certain way <#\>Uh
not just sit and <O>3 syll</O> to respond in such a way that we
know <O>4 syll</O> <#\>Uhm we assist the woman in in <,> through the 
process to obtain a protection order with a maximum amount of
information for her and minimum of stress we hope <#\>Uhm we also
assist in getting women in contact with cultural <O>3 syll</O>
services and train we also train community <O>2 syll</O> to become
aware of relevant cultural issues <#\>We provide legal advice
assistance and counselling to women considering <,,> criminal
charges assault charges or sexual assault <,,> charges <#\>We
provide legal advice and assistance or referrals to other
solicitors regarding <O>4 syll</O> compensation <#\>We help them in
applying for priority public housing <,,> uh social security
benefits and <,,> a number of the community organisations that
employ a person for <O>1 syll</O> domestic problems counselling
groups so as they will refer women back to me or or <O>2 syll</O>
support counselling <#\>Uhm <,,> the way this scheme is built
is that <,> it's <,,> as we see it an interactive
cooperative relationship between the solicitors and the
community<,,> workers <#\>The way <,,> we try to organise it is
so that support workers aren't seen as secondary to
solicitors <#\>Solicitors are <,> you know they have a higher
stance than the support workers <#\>Everyone's <,,> equal on the
team <#\>Everyone has important skills to contribute to it and
if
there are in- <,,> well not inadequacies or if people have
been treated differently like if solicitors <,,> you know
<,,> by chance <,> think the support workers are over there to
make cups of tea and coffee then the correct person responds
very quickly <#\>So it's very important <,,> to <,,> for us to
make sure that everyone feels equal in the scheme and that
they can <O>6 syll</O> contribution <#\>Uhm <,,> everyone works on
the scheme as part of their <,> work <#\>They're all <,> uhm <,,>
employed professionals <,,> and we feel that that's very
important because <,,> for a number of reasons <#\>One is that
uhm <,,> all of those people have got their own training
and they can bring <O>4 syll</O> their own <,> skills that they <O>4
syll</O> <#\>Uhm <,> it's important for their <,> for them to have
a
commitment <O>4 syll</O> by their employer to attend the scheme
<#\>Uhm <,> it's also important that the whole thing's not seen
as
<O>4 syll</O> exercise that <,,> workers <,,> have to work with
them <O>3 syll</O> they don't just go there to make cups of tea and
coffee and <,,> and then just leave them <O>4 syll</O> which is
how <,,> some <,,> support services work <#\>Unfortunately
they're <O>6 syll</O> but <,,> uhm <,,> there are a lot of
volunteers who are now <,> doing what's called <O>1 syll</O>
support that really doesn't amount to much more than
handholding and <,,> and saying <O>15 syll</O> <#\>I- uhm I <O>1 syll</O>
make you a cup of tea <#\>Uhm to us <,,><O>1 syll</O> support's much
more than that <,> and it has to be much more than that
otherwise it's not <,> not gonna <,> really be effective <#\>Uhm
<,,> as I said every Wednesday we gotta lot of support from
the local Court <#\>Every Wednesday the Chamber Magistrate
organises it so that all the domestic violence <O>5 syll</O> the
same day <#\>And <,,> we have <,> a community leader <O>1-2 syll</O>
solicitor and two support workers <,,> who attend Court on the
day <#\>All the women going to Court <,> if they know <,,> about
<,,> uhm the scheme will <,,> come <O>7 syll</O> in the morning
about nine thirty <#\>Solicitors and support workers meet with
the
women and then walk up to the Court <,,> together which is
just around the corner <,,> so that uhm the women can avoid
having to sort of have some <,,> unfortunate <,,> sort of
confrontation with their spouse or whatever <#\>Because that can
<,> <O>2 syll</O> <,> <O>3 syll</O> <#\>Uhm <,> we take them inside the
Court in side the Court room <#\>It's called <,>Court precincts
itself is in a separate room <,,> uhm where the women can sit
<#\>That room is used only for domestic violence victims on the
Wednesday <#\>It's not used at any other time <#\>And uhm <,,>
(cough) inside we've got tea and coffee facilities <#\>We've got
plenty of space for kids if the women ever brought kids <#\>Uhm
<,,> toys and stuff like that pamphlets information etc <#\>And
it's basically a safe space for the women <,,> to sit in <,,>
uhm <,> so that they don't <,> as I say they don't have to
confront their spouse or <,,> uhm <O>6 syll</O> trouble <,,>
basically can avoid <#\>Uhm <,,> and <,,> what we've got to now
is that in other Courts the magistrates will often require the
women to get <O>4 syll</O> to give evidence or at least come into
court <#\>The way we <,> deal with it which can be seen as <,,>
positive and a negative thing I suppose is that <,> the women
can sit in the room the whole time <#\>They never have to leave
and bring the solicitor <O>2 syll</O> negotiating <,,> u- uhm on
the woman's behalf <,,> uhm without her <O>4 syll</O> support <#\>Some
women wanna go to the Court 'cause they wanna see what's going
on <,,> uhm or they wanna hear what what their husband or
whoever has got to say <#\>But for those women that <,> really
can't face the thought of going into the courtroom <,,> they
can stay in there and have the whole thing dealt with <,,>
whilst they sit there <#\>Uhm <,,> so <,> as I say it's got <,>
sort of positive and negative things <#\>Some people would see
that that's not really empowering the women <#\>We see that it
<O>3 syll</O> a woman should be able to make a choice of whether she
goes into court or not <,,> uhm whether she feels intimidated
or not <#\>Uhm what happens is that <,,> the support workers
will sit down with the woman take details from her <,> about
the domestic violence history <,,> whether she's had injuries
what kind of responses she's had with police officers whether
there's kids involved <,,> what her housing problems are and
her other needs <#\>They then give that <,> information <O>2 syll</O>
<,> for or to the solicitor <,,> and <,> then it's basically
the solicitor's job <,,> if he <,> felt a need to go on and
talk to him about trying to get <,,> orders <,> by agreement
with him <#\>Uhm about eighty percent of the <O>3 syll</O> that we get
are like <O>2 syll</O> <,,> with me <#\>And that's <,> something that
the magistrate tries to achieve <#\>She's not very keen on <O>8
syll</O> <#\>And she's not (noise) offended <,,> uhm <,,> by the man
because it's basically just <,,> you know more problem than
it's worth <#\>It's more discomfort for both parties and it
prolongs the matter <#\>So what she tries to emphasise to the man
is what <,,> will happen if orders are made against him that
she tries to <,,> talk him well not talk him into but try to
<,> get him to see that <O>3 syll</O> to order is not gonna be a
major problem to him <O>5 syll</O></I>
