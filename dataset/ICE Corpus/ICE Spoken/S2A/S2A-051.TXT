<I><#\>This is the Macquarie Uni text-to-speech system, um,
developed
at Macquarie University by Robert Mannell and John Clarke and
also myself over approximately the last ten years <#\>Um, the
software you're seeing at the moment is running on a Sun Spark
Station <#\>Um, it's written completely in C so it's portable and
um <#\>At the moment we've got it running on Sun Spark Station
under Unix, a Vax work station under V M S, and an I B M P C,
um, running in 386 technimode <#\>The idea of the text-to-speech
system is to um, take orthographic text and convert it into
parameters which are suitable for a formant speech
synthesiser <#\>We have um, several such devices available
<#\>Um,
the original being the original Macquarie Uni text-to-speech
synthesiser which was developed by Clive Sommerfield and John
Clarke under a Telecom grant <#\>The one that we use at the
moment is a velarise synthesiser designed by Clive
Sommerfield and implemented by him <#\>And that's um, the
hardware design of that is a lot cleaner than the original and
the um, final spectral parameter output is slightly different
<#\>Um in the main menu of the text-to-speech system at the
moment, you can see there's several options <#\>Um, the first of
which is to input a text file into the system <#\>The second is
to input a sentence, that is, you type a sentence in <#\>Your
third and fourth options um, relate to um, inputting a S B R
file <#\>The fifth option relates to the internal language of the
text-to-speech system which some of the um, language modules
are written in <#\>And um, the other options relate to grapheme
to phoneme translation <#\>I'll put a sentence through, one that
has been pre-calculated, oh sorry, typed in already <#\>Um <,>
<#\>The sentence is <quote>The number that you have dialled has
been disconnected <#\>Please contact directory assistance for
further information</quote> <#\>The project is sponsored at the
moment by O T C so it's, this is a reasonable demonstration
sentence as it, as you could expect that, um, that would be
one of the things that the text-to-speech system employed in a
telecommunications um, area might be asked to say <#\>Um, there
are many stages involved in the translation from orthographic
text to synthesis parameters <#\>First, the text is pre-
processed <#\>Um, the pre-processor determines where the sentence
boundaries and the word boundaries lie, and also expands any
non-lexical information out into um, word form <#\>For instance
a
number might get expanded into a word um <#\>Also it handles
abbreviations and turns them into um, translates them
phonemically <#\>Um, once the um, pre-processing has occurred,
each of the words can then be translated into their phonetic
equivalents <#\>Um, sorry to say um all the time <#\>This is
done
using a a dictionary and grapheme to phoneme software <#\>The
dictionary contains about thirteen thousand entries which ah,
have been, has things like the endings taken off them so that
they're basically base words <#\>For instance <mention>run</mention> would
be in the dictionary but <mention>running</mention> or <mention>runs</mention>
wouldn't be <#\>Those um are handled by a separate module which
tends to morphologically analyse the word <#\>If that all fails
and the word is not found in the dictionary, then the phonemic
translation is created using grapheme to phoneme rules which
were developed by John <?>Lavar</?> and John Clarke from the Naval
Research Rules <#\>Once the the orthographic text has been
translated into phonemes, um, then intrusive approximates can
be generated and function words can be reduced <#\>Then the
syllable level can be generated <#\>The syllables are marked out
using a principle known as the Maximum o Onset Principle which
states that there are already valid, certain valid consonant
clusters in a syllable and that um, given that you know where
the, what the consonant clusters are, you can then work out
where the syllable boundaries are <#\>Jonothan Harrington helped
with that side of the research <#\>The tonal phrases can then be
marked intonational intermediate phrases <#\>Those are used to
help determine where the pitch events are located once we get
down to producing the <O>inaudible 1 word</O> contour <#\>Um, the feet
phrases are also marked, then the pitch events are placed on
the, on the map so to speak <#\>All the pitch events are marked
and then some of them are pinned out depending on whether a
word is repeated twice in a sentence, whether a word is
perhaps not deserving of of so much stress <,> <#\>Once that has
been done the F nought contour can then be interpolated
between each of the pitch events <#\>That gives you your pitch
<#\>The syllables, the duration of each of the syllables is
calculated using, um a a neural network <#\>A neural network is
basically a connections model which <#\>It's basically a black
box which you put inputs in and it gives you an out, gives you
the output based on past experience <#\>The syllable neural
network was trained using data from the Macquarie Uni speech
database called the Scribe Project which <,> has about five
speakers and we we concentrated on one speaker and found out
all the, we accepted all the syllable durations and all the
contexts and we produced, we trained the neural network on
that data <#\>You can see here that ah each of the syllables has
been assigned a duration from the neural network and it's
based on the context of the syllable <#\>Like for instance if the
syllable was at the end of an intonational phrase boundary,
it's going to be longer than one which is at the start of an
intonational phrase boundary <,> <#\>That is how the syllable
lengths are determined <#\>The phoneme lengths are determined by
a by a hypotheses known as the Elasticity Hypothesis, which
states that given a certain context, the number of standard
deviations of each phoneme away from its mean will be similar
for ea, will be identical for each syllable <#\>So for instance
you take, look at one syllable and say it has five phonemes in
it, then for each syllable it is K number of standard
deviations away from the meaning of that syl, of that phoneme
<&>Interruption - break in recording</&> <#\>The speech parameters
have been calculated now and they've been sent to the
synthesis device which you can't hear 'cause I had the volume
turned down <#\>Um, we're now at the second menu which is the
speak menu <#\>There are various options <#\>One is to play the
utterance again <#\>Um others pertain to the graphing and viewing
of the data <#\>I'll graph the knowledge tree which is the centre
of the entire text-to-speech system, which it shows, there's a
hierarchical knowledge tree which contains all the, most of
the information about how the the speech parameters have been
calculated <#\>I'll just zoom into the <O>inaudible 3 words</O>
<#\>You
can see that, there there are actually about twelve or
thirteen hierarchical levels which are all bounded by one
another <#\>You can only look at a certain number each time
because the tree's actually three dimensional, and this lev,
the the version I'm looking at here um shows the paragraph
onto the synthesis level then onto the intertwine level which
consists of words and punctuation <#\>Then it shows the
phonetics, the um, syllable boundaries <#\><&>Interruption - break
in recording</&> <#\>It shows the group phonetic level and then
syllable level and then how each of the syllables are broken
up into individual phonetics <#\>By clicking on each object you
can find out more about it <#\>For instance, by clicking on the
phon, on a phonetic element you can find out how long it is
<#\>Um, you can find out how many standard deviations it is away
from the mean <#\>So, you can also find out things like phonetic
class <#\>You can click on any item to find out basically what
the system has decided to do with it <#\>To change, you can
change the view and then have a look at something like the the
tonal elements <#\>This is a graph showing how the intonational
boundaries and intermediate boundaries and <?>fifth</?> boundaries
have been solved <#\>You can look at that in relation to the <,>
to the sentences and words by loading in another different
template which shows how they, how the intermediate boundaries
are derived from the intertwined level <#\>Once we get down to
the group phonetic level we can start generating the actual
speech parameters <#\>The F nought generation has already been
discussed <#\>Um, the system at the moment is designed as a
diphenyl system where it takes diphenyl templates and
calculates them to form the parameters which are then sent out
to the device <#\>I'll graph some of the parameters and you can
see that <,> <#\>This is the F nought curve <,> <#\>If I zoom in
a
bit you can actually see the phonemes <#\>Those are the S B R
phonemes which are being superseded by the diphenyl approach
I can play that data <#\>You can see the cursor zoom across the
screen <#\>Although this computer is capable of playing the
speech it's not capable of playing it in real time because we
don't have a hardware synthesiser hooked up to it <#\>It's all
done in software <#\>You can <O>inaudible 4 words</O> software
<#\>Eventually Robert Mannells' software will be hooked up to it
<#\>We hope to hope um output via the the twenty <?>kilograph</?>
<O>inaudible 3 words</O> <#\>I can change the view and have a look at
some of the other parameters <#\>I'll look at them, all of them
together <#\>This is showing formants <#\>You can see you've got
um
nasal, F one, F two, F three, F four and F five coming up <#\>The
computer's running slightly slow at the moment because Steve
is running his neural net, network on it, and <O>inaudible 2
words</O> software <#\>This is the <?>gains</?> <#\>You can see they're
all
from zero to a negative number representing the number of
decibels <#\>Zero being the highest intensity <#\>Using this
software you can actually modify any numbers should you wish
to experiment or try out something different <,> <#\>This is the
the bandwidth curves and <O>inaudible 1 word</O> parameters which
tell you whether the signal is voiced or or voiceless, voiced
or noise <,> <#\>You can zoom in or out <O>inaudible 6 words</O> to
the other piece of software and <O>inaudible 5 words</O>
information pertaining to where the current value of the the
cursor <#\>Um, you can load in a different template</I>

<I><$A> <#\>This here is the <,> the 
headphones<,> <#\>I<,> dismantle the headphones<,,> so that I
can get to the<,,> central part of the<,,> <O>inaudible</O>
because these have to be removed<,> and fitted onto another <,> another part of the instrument
<#\>That part there is <,> is the driver
and these are a teledime<,> telephonics<,> T D H tele teledime dynamic headphone<,> model fifty three.
<#\>Each different headphone that's used<,> has a different
calibration<,> <#\>That is ah they have different threshold
levels<,,> <#\>That would then be fitted<,> to<,> this<,>
device here which is called an artificial ear<,,> <#\>Now I'll
show you in a minute what that other device is for <#\>The
artificial ear is ah <,,> doesn't look
very much like an ear at all<,> but the reason they use this
is because<,> it gives an approximation of a human ear<,>
<#\>There's special little cavities <O>inaudible</O> into this
um the shape of it the mass of it and gives the gives characteristics similar to a human ear but<,>
mainly<,> it's<,> a common instrument between<,>
calibrators<,> <#\>So between here<,> <#\>I'll calibrate<,>
these on this type of instrument with that type of
measurement<,,> sound level meter <#\>And somebody else would
calibrate this with exactly the same type<,> so we have
consistency between calibrations<,> <#\>Um<,> the<,,>
artificial ear<,> has fitted to it a microphone<,> <#\>A
very<,> very accurate and very sensitive microphone<,> and
very costly <#\>Um it's worth about fifteen hundred dollars<,>
for just the little microphone okay and this is a little guard
over the top <#\>I've taken it off <#\>Don't touch the top
<w>'cos</w> it's very sensitive <#\>I've actually had people
throw<,> these to me and say <quote>here <@>firstnameA</@> 
catch</quote> and then I show them the bill later and they go
<quote>ah ah</quote> and breathe very heavily for a little
while<,,> <#\>The microphone's fitted on top of there<,,> and
then<,></I>
