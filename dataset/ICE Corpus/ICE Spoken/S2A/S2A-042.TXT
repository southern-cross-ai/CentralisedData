<S2A-042> <2013>
<I><$A> <#\>Thank you and good evening<,> <#\>I was going
to<,> speak off the cuff until about half past four this
afternoon when I thought I'd better jolly well put something
on paper <#\>It might be a little more orderly<,> <#\>Thank
you for the invitation to come tonight as it's very much a
pleasure for me to meet and speak with some of you so far<,>
<#\>Well some of the questions<,> which were put to me in the
invitation were or one of them to begin with was what led me
to do it <O>laughter</O> <#\>And I s'pose it's it's er<,> an accumulation of lots of things
but<,> I did <,,> er recall that in childhood I loved to be
yarning <#\>I grew up in a in an extended
family in commun in a community of<,> lots
of family and friends where<,> it was very much their<,> way
to<,> sit a long time after <,> after the
meals or<,> in between times or over cups of tea wherever<,>
picnics in the bush and just yarn about anything and
everything which<,> didn't often seem of much consequence but
it must've impressed me very much and certainly I remember
it<,> as a very enjoyable thing<,> amongst family and
friends<,,> <#\>Also<,> I recall that I didn't keep diaries
and I did scribble to myself from time to time to record<,>
especially wonderful<,> or awful moments and events<,> or to
clarify my thoughts<,> in resolving difficult and very private
matters<,> which I felt I couldn't discuss with anyone at
all<,> <#\>So<,,> I liked the written word and I liked the the spoken word <#\>I enjoyed both very
much <#\>There's nothing like a good speech<,> or a good
sermon<,> or hearing the woodcutters or farmers in the bush
yarning on<,> or later sitting on<,,> in sitting
in <,> on endless student arguments about the meaning
of life<,> with Bob during his student years <#\>I'm was very
much an observer in all that but I<,> soaked it up enjoying it
very much<,> <#\>Also <O>sigh</O> I felt that my life had
been<,> a curious mixture of ordinary<,> and extraordinary
things<,> so perhaps it would be of interest to others<,> at
the same time being something that they could identify with
themselves and this a thing that I've noticed very much indeed
since the book was published <#\>Ah there was<,> a flood of
mail in the earlier weeks and months and still there's a
trickle <#\>There's a continuity of <,> of 
comment and quite a bit of it is <,> is 
along the lines of<,> identification of having experienced
similar difficulties or joys and pleasures and relishing<,>
the sharing of them <#\>So the information one might say was
there<,> in me and the in the in the 
enjoyment of sharing other peoples lives and the other side of
that coin<,> is being willing<,> to share my own<,,> <#\>Ah
when we were in Canberra<,> I'd had requests from students
wanting to do a profile or writers to write my story from
interviews<,> others who wanted to write it themselves<,,> but
I was loathe to let it go<,,> and this carried over over to the time when it went onto audio tape
<#\>I wanted it to be my own voice but I <O>laughs</O> hope
that doesn't sound<,> egotistical but it was rather for
authenticity and directness <#\>It was me and I wanted it<,>
to be a direct communication<,> both on paper<,> and aur
er to the ear um<,> to whomever I was
communicating with<,> <#\>From the very beginning of all this
I was enjoying myself enormously<,> <#\>Everything about the
doing of this book from its inception through the writing and
editing<,> the promotion and the selling<,> and the follow
up<,> of which this evening is a part<,,> has been an
undiluted pleasure for me <#\>I've had to pinch myself
sometimes to see if it was really happening<,> to me<,> and
around me <#\>I've made new friends<,> and added a dimension
to some longstanding friendships through this book <#\>And by
doing something I didn't know I could do<,> I have gained
confidence at a time in my life<,> when that is of especial
value<,,> <#\>In <quote>My Own Life</quote> <,> I described how
I talked with Ruth Park earlier<,> about amongst other things
the reasons for writing autobiography <#\>She was embarking on
the same project as<,> I'm sure you're<,> aware<,,> now <#\>I
do believe that if one's honest<,> it can bring insights of
explanations in one's life and one's relationships<,> which
would perhaps<,> have otherwise been missed<,,> <#\>That it
was unusual for an ex-Prime Minister's wife to do this kind of
book<,> was no impediment <#\>In fact that made it easier
because some of the issues discussed I would not have broached
had they not already been <&>knocks microphone Some
inaudible</&> knowledge <#\>Sorry about that <O>laughter</O>
<,,> <#\>If they'd not already been public knowledge through
Bob's decades in public life and his preparedness to have let
people know him <#\>Um there had after all have been three
biographies<,> and endless written and electronic media<,>
reports and writings on him<,> warts and all <#\>The edition
of <quote>My Own Life</quote> was was a
few of my own warts and weaknesses<,> not addressed in order
to purge myself<,> I think I'd already<,> done that<,,> but to
keep my story honest and real <#\>How to do it<,> was another
question in the<,> invitation <#\>I recall the derision part
on some of the women's writings that I'd noticed in sixties
and seventies <#\>That they were just tracts <#\>To write my
story chronologically would be that <,> that we did this<,> that happened<,> etcetera
<#\>So I had to write <quote>My Own Life</quote> as I had
experienced it<,> rather than as a series of events<,,> though
there was<,> of necessity<,> an ordered time frame <#\>I was
better at that anyway I found <#\>It was borne out when I came
to my public life years early in nine till from
early nineteen<,> eighty-three till<,> the end of
nineteen ninety-one <#\>And it would have read as nine years
of public and political events and observations<,> <#\>Though
that was a large slice of my existence in those years it would
have been boring to readers and to me<,> had I strung them or
even the highlights together <#\>I did this <#\>We did that
<#\>This happened <#\>That happened <#\>Boring<,,> <#\>I
recalled Ruth Park's words <#\>She said <quote>if you leave
all the I's out<,> there's nothing left<,,> in some<,>
autobiographies</quote> <#\>So it was clear to me that I had
to keep to the experiential and to the context of our times
<#\>I like to claim that it is at its humble level a bit of
social history<,> reflecting the changes and questions<,>
which arose for Bob and I as partners and for us and our
children<,> especially during the sixties and seventies
<#\>They were times of enormous social change and
questioning<,,> <#\>Two crucial choices in my life which I've
been able to make with autonomy were the choice of my husband
and my editor <O>laughter</O> <#\>Those decisions have been
either dead lucky or inspired or both <O>laughter</O> <#\>I
had admired from anonymous distance the partnership of two
young mothers Hilary McPhee and Diana Gribble<,> who took
their babies in baskets to a humble office in Melbourne to
begin publishing <#\>When Di's letter came late in nineteen
ninety I think it was<,,> expressing interest in publishing a
book<,> and outlining the sort of book she envisaged<,>
amongst all the others<,,> it leapt out <#\>I responded <#\>We
met and the spark was instant and mutual <#\>I cannot speak
highly enough of my editor<,> as she has become another of my
very treasured friends<,> <#\>Her remarks to you tonight explain will explain the way we worked<,>
together with my friend and checker Sue Spence <#\>The
frankness and fun that we had together are indeed
memorable<,,> though it could all come legitimately under the
heading of total application and hard speedy work<,> as we
raced the calendar to catch the Christmas market
<O>laughter</O> and we just made it <O>laughter</O> <#\>Now
they're all the notes that I've made and I don't know whether
you want me to ramble on or <,> or sit down
and see what happens next <O>laughter</O> <O>inaudible from
audience</O> <#\>I'd be happy for for Di
to<,> and then<,> we'll see <#\>Take it from there <#\>Will
that do? <O>inaudible from audience</O> <#\>Okay thanks
<O>applause</O>
 
 <O>Di Gribble speaks. Then question time</O>

<$B> <#\>To Hazel<,> did you have a slow run to being a public
person<,> or did you find yourself suddenly totally in the
public light<,,> 
<$A> <#\>It was very gradual actually and it was something
that I resisted in earlier years and I did discuss this er a
bit in the book<,> ah but Bob's life ah became public very early ah very early on <#\>Well from when
we<,> went to Melbourne and he was the ah<,> the Research
Officer for the Australian Council of Trade Unions and then
became the advocate um then the President and on it went and
he was always<,> heavily involved in Labor Party affairs and
of matters public and ah<,> as you know he was pretty
outspoken and<,,> he was considered pretty good ah<,> ah
subject for television and interview<,> so that um his life
was very public <#\>I resisted in some degree and with varied
success<,> um<,,> in in avoiding or just
refusing and I wasn't terribly popular with a lot of the media
people because there is an assumption amongst them or many of
them I I think it's safe to say most of
them um the assumption that <,> that 
they've a right to know they've a right<,> to write and er<,>
I didn't er concede that<,> and it was er particularly ah<,>
because of my desire to keep<,> the lives of our children as
normal as possible <#\>I didn't want them to be<,> on public
view as it were and ah<,> I think I did <#\>I did use that
letter in the<,> book didn't I <#\>Yes <#\>I wrote a letter to
the Age and it was er it was in<,> I
think the early seventies<,> when the ah child of a Federal
Politician had been um<,> I thought unfairly treated by the
press and there was a bit furore about it and I wrote to the
Age <#\>And it was along those lines that they had a right to
privacy and I clung to that right <#\>And so I had
some I had some real donnybrooks with journos I
can tell you<,> and I wasn't very popular amongst some of them
but so<,> I gradually<,> became used to<,,> dealing with it<,>
to working out my own ways of<,> getting around that or of<,>
diverting them or of giving them just enough to <,> to put them on their way without<,> me going
further than I wanted to and especially again with respect of
the children<,> um <#\>But I did see when Bob went to Canberra
that it was quite different and this was before he was Prime
Minister when he when he was the member
for Wills but sitting<,> on the Opposition benches<,> and
ah<,> I saw then that <,> that he had a
constituency<,> which<,,> you know in a sense he had a
constituency when he was leading the trade union movement but
it was different<,> ah <#\>It was an appointment and it wasn't
an elected thing <#\>It wasn't in in in 
any way the same as being a political representative of a<,>
geographical constituency <#\>So I saw that there was some
responsibility in the matter and I was very fortunate that our
children were by<,> then getting on with their own lives and
it wasn't so relevant in the same way as it used to have been
for me<,> so I tended to loosen up a bit but I always still<,>
thought very carefully <#\>When he ah<,> suddenly became the
leader<,> of the Labor Party and then also suddenly became the
Prime Minister<,> there was<,> ah a lot of<,> inquiry and
request and pressure and I at first tried to script myself
to<,> <quote>now they might ask me this <#\>What'll I say to
that</quote> you know thinking it through before hand<,> and I
a very<,> dear friend about whom I speak in the book also<,>
but I don't mention this incident which I'm about to tell you
<#\>I said to her<,> <quote>how do you reckon that
went</quote> <,> and she said <quote>you're scripting yourself
you</quote></I>
