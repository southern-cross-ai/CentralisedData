<S2A-030> <2035>
<I><$A> <#\>Now first of all we are located down behind the
library <#\>If you go down the steps next to the bookshop you'll
and go past the banks you'll come to the self service cottage
on your right and the Careers Service on your left <#\>Um the the
Careers Service consists of the careers cottage and then
behind it are two demountable buildings that we call the annex
and in one of those is the careers library <#\>Now it's only a
small library but it is a library of employers and we have
information about most of the larger employers who are
interested in graduates <#\>Now the library is open from the
careers service is open from nine till four Monday to Friday
<#\>Um we close a half hour for lunch from twelve thirty till one
<#\>The library is open Monday to Thursday every week and then
every second Friday <#\>Now the the library will be important to
all of you in researching firms so that before you approach
anybody you know a lot about them and if we don't have
something there for you we might be able to give you some
ideas as to where you can proceed from there to get
information <#\>The other thing that's available is a book called
<quote>Graduate Opportunities</quote> which some of you may
be aware of <#\>It's published each year by the Graduate Careers
Council of Australia and it has a lot of information about the
the Australia-wide graduate employers <#\>It has ah names and
contact numbers and addresses of the human resource managers
that's the personnel people in each of those companies and
it's mostly about what types of graduates they're interested
in and how to apply <#\>So that book which has in previous years
been distributed free um is now we we now have to charge four
dollars for <#\>It's still very cheap and it's still heavily
subsidised by the G C C A because their retail price is twenty
seven dollars but um we do have to change four <#\>Now if you
want a copy of that you can get it through the Careers Service
just come down to the cottage to the front desk reception <#\>Um
for those of you in the Taxidity Program you'll be collecting
the Taxidity book later on <#\>There is a practice sheet in there
if you're interested <#\>Now through the year we'll be offering
workshops to help you improve your job seeking skills on
things like preparing a resume finding vacancies rather than
through newspapers and on interview skills themselves <#\>We'll
also be offering workshop type things such as um public
speaking and assertive training for workshops presenting
yourself orally or comfortably some of those things and also
career exploration workshop to help you look at for those of
you who do just generalist courses to look at particularly
what kind of areas you should be going into <#\>Now information
about those workshops we've actually um we'll be getting some
more of the semester programs run off today and tomorrow so if
you call in anytime after perhaps tomorrow lunchtime to the
Careers Service you can get a copy of of this but there'll be
more available and more workshops being added as the year goes
on so if you pop down every couple of weeks or so and see
what's new that would be the best thing <#\>There's two ways to
have it communicated with the students <#\>One of them is through
this type of thing which you can pick up at the cottage and in
the careers library and the other one is through um a
publication called <quote>Careers Macquarie</quote> which is
a newspaper clipping service which summarises all the jobs
that are appropriate for our first degree students <#\>At this
stage we we haven't included the postgraduate jobs because
we'd basically be cutting everything almost everything for
those so we've tended to confine it to the jobs suitable to
new graduates and the Careers Macquarie summarises vacancies
that have been published in the previous week in a whole range
of newspapers and different magazines <#\>Now those jobs are ones
that are available right now so there're not probably so
applicable to students until there're getting to about um
November or or perhaps August onwards for those of you who are
finishing at the end of this year <#\>If you're finishing at the
end of this semester then I would suggest you pick up a copy
of that every week as well <#\>Now it comes out usually Wednesday
afternoon and is available we just leave them um <?>for the time
it's free</?> outside the cottage on the wall outside <#\>OK
<#\>So
um pick those up at any time <#\>The Careers Library um if you
just walk in the door on the right there is a wooden stand
where any new information is put so if you pop in there
anytime you're going past and see what's there <#\>The sort of
things you might find are information about the workshops
information about um applications that are being called for
different companies <#\>We will often get application forms sent
out um for students to collect from us people who aren't
necessarily going through other programs that we run and we
don't know really when they're coming only that they're
usually come sort of about a certain time each year so you
really do need to pop in and see what's there <#\>Um as you get
towards the end of the year when you're within say a month or
so of graduating you can get your resume put on our data base
<#\>Now what we do with that is we have people who're immediately
available for work or almost immediately and employers will
contact us with a vacancy they've got and we then send them
short lists of resumes that have the appropriate
qualifications <#\>OK <#\>Now you need to sign a form saying it's
OK
for us to send it away <#\>We ask for about five copies of your
resume to keep in our database and everytime we send one to
the employer we'll send you a letter letting you know that
we've done that <#\>So you can join the database when you
approach graduation <#\>You can also join our job club at that
time as well and through the job club keep updating your
skills reviewing your resume and interview skills to to help
you get into work <#\>The job club just provides the sort of
ongoing support and skills improvement so the you ah you don't
sort of give up and you still feel that you're in the race <#\>Um
or how many um postgraduate students have we got here today
<#\>You <#\>OK <#\>So most people here will probably if you want
to get
together with a furth a few postgraduate students together to
run perhaps special workshops run for you I'm quite happy to
do that <#\>OK <#\>Um how many teaching students do we have
<#\>Alright
well the teaching people the edu the state education
department will be recruiting through us in um August the
interviews usually are August September so for that program
you'll get information through your classes in around June or
early second semester and again applications will be called
<#\>Now we'll be running particular resume workshops and
interview
workshops for that group at that time so if you just look out
for them through your your class teachers you'll find you
<O>inaudible, two words</O> <#\>If you don't get to hear anything and
you're worried about it just come in and ask us what's
happening <#\>OK <#\>And then you've you've got the resume
database
and the job club when you get towards the end of the year we
don't have so many jobs for teachers for for teaching
companies that would be more in other areas where you'd be
interested in working that we could help you with that <#\>There
are you know four hour um on campus programs the only people
who really cover those things for us are um recruiting large
number of graduates so a lot of the other work we do is then
individual um the odd vacancy with an employer the database
and but we can help you improve your skills generally <#\>Um
overseas students <#\>How many overseas students have we got
here <#\>A few OK <#\>Now um you're the Singapore Careers Fair
is
the main one that's available in Australia to you <#\>It's not
that easy to help you to find jobs back overseas but we do
have some reference books that we give you addresses to write
to and places to start and we have to <O>inaudible, two words</O>
come out and interview for Malaysians who've graduated in say
the economics and accounting at the end of each year <#\>Um so
the Singapore-Korean Fair we we don't have the information
format yet it usually comes in early April April sometime so
if you would just check with us sometime before the end of
April as to what's going on and the Fair itself is usually in
August or September but you have to have your resumes in well
before that to be collected for interviews <#\>Alright <#\>So
watch
out for that <#\>Um the law students <#\>How many law students
have
we got here <#\>Alright <#\>You'll be getting more information
about
your program posted out to you but there will be a Law Careers
Fair that will be held on ah Wednesday today fortnight on the
twenty first of March from one o'clock till four o'clock in
level three function room in the um ah union building <#\>Now the
careers fair for the law people this particular one is just
for commercial law firms so they're really only interested in
um second last year and final year law graduates who want 
work in the commercial sector <#\>You've really got to have more
qualifications to go to that fair but it is important to go
It's the first time we've had a Law Careers Fair at Macquarie
and we would like it to be successful so they want to come
back again next year <#\>Um the the general Careers Fair will be
ah in two on Tuesday in two weeks on the thirtieth of March
<#\>Now that careers fair is includes a a range of employers they
are mainly we we write to hundreds of employers to try to
involve them in the fair but the ones who want to come are
mostly looking for economics accounting graduates some of them
are looking more broadly for generalist degree people so I
encourage the science and arts and food tech people to come as
well but anyone who's interested in just finding out what's
available and what employers are offering you're welcome to
come <#\>Now that will run from one o'clock until six o'clock
level three in the union building the function rooms and um
it's on Tuesday the thirtieth of March <#\>Ok now the rest of the
programs um that I want to talk in more detail about are just
with the economics arts and science students so probably the
others of you I think you've got the main ideas on what we
offer this program here is um the campus interview program and
they are they won't be for people other than final year
undergraduate students in economics accounting and in some law
computing and other general sciences <#\>So for the other
students if you could follow up by um continuing contact with
the Careers Service through the year finding out what
workshops we've got available <#\>If you've got a special need
or
something you specially think we should look into providing
for you perhaps you could come and see me and we'll see what
we can do <#\>Alright <#\>So I'll let you up the other group
apart
from arts um sciences and economics go now <#\>You could call
into the Careers Service and pick up a workshop timetable
sometime over the next week <&>pause while people leave</&>
<#\>Ok <#\>Now at the end of the session um the booklets over
here
are only applicable to the the arts science and economics
people so that the general programs will be available at the
cottage for those of you who want who would like those</I>
