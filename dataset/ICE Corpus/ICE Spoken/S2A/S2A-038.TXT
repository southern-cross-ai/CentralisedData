<I><$A> <#\>I studied in the United States um <,> did a
bachelors's degree in psych and now I'm going to do a masters
in organisational behaviour <#\>One of the things I noticed
about organisational behaviour is it was somewhat of an
attempt to to become multi-disciplined in
the sense that <O>cough</O> the people in my department came
out of sociology or psychology or a few had a business
background and we had a couple of deviation partners <#\>They had
very much a <,> a management perspective
<#\>Other people had a very much a psychology <,> perspective
and were affected heavily by the values of people like Rogers
and <O>inaudible</O> and so on <,,> <#\>Identities
<O>inaudible</O> program <,> it <,> was ahead of its time and
you'd come out a bit ah <O>inaudible</O> program you'd end up
out there and you'd get <,> <#\>We want when's when's the world going to catch up to all the good
stuff that we're doing <#\>Um I experienced that <,,> um
<#\>I'm finding now that a lot of things that we learnt about
ah when I was going through uni as a they're actually now
starting to do it in companies <,> um <,> <#\>The majority of
them aren't yet up to the level of sophistication I'd like to
see but there are there are movements
where they haven't been there in the past <#\>Um one
area that companies have got interested in because <,>
 the goals of academics and the goals of consultants
and the goals of industry are all different goals <#\>You know
we'd like to think that these united or moving towards a
common objective but certainly the way that their goals
expressed varies so unless a company can see value in making actually making some money or saving
some costs or keep themselves out of law courts um they really
aren't that interested <#\>But enough managers are now
starting to see that even though it's not always easy to
quantify the success of <,> um people skills programs that
there is some real dollar value <#\>That they're aware that
that's an ingredient which if you look at systems theory seems
to inter-penetrate all the other models <#\>Your financial
systems your production systems your policy procedures are all
<,> affected by the people area or the hu human substance <,> <#\>So what what that has <O>cough</O> led to is <,> a number
of companies in the last sorry intercept right <#\>New concept
<#\>One of the things that's been very noticeable is how
effective the Japanese have been over the last few years in
the market place and one of the reasons they've been able to
improve their market share and their um <,> productivity has
been their use of things like quality and teams and a number
of other factors such as those which were first postulated by
American theorists but not adopted by American
theorists um not adopted by American companies 
ah as a group so <,> General Macarthur <,> brought in people
like ah Dr Denning into ah Japan also Duran and people like
that and they brought in ideas about quality that were not
accepted by American companies as a whole <#\>There's all
sorts of reasons for that <#\>One is that the American market
place just kept on growing <#\>It had very little competition
after the second world war <#\>Europe was flat <#\>Japan was 
flat <#\>There was really no competition so Americans could
keep on producing products as they weren't up to standard
quality wise nobody cared <#\>And they perpetuated the ideal
making the myth that American products were actually better
<#\>I think in some areas they were good <,> um <#\>The
Japanese took on the ideas of Denning and Duran and started
implementing quality and because of that their their products increased in products in increased in in ah
performance and quality but at the same time actually reduced
the cost <#\>The idea is that quality costs money and that
certainly isn't so <#\>You can actually reduce costs by
increasing quality and it's all in the process and one of the
<O>inaudible</O> things that Denning said is that <,,> eighty
five percent of the problems of low productivity is in the
system not in people <#\>So if eighty five percent of the
cause of the problems is in the system management designed the
system so management can now design a better system
<O>inaudible</O> <,> <#\>So that's created a need to 
<,> to be competitive <#\>They have to keep on
looking at how the work is organised how people are motivated
how people are organised in a working environment ah <#\>So
that led to a fair bit of research a fair bit of work being
done and the idea of total quality management became a very
popular concept and this idea now has spread through Europe
United States and in fact most large companies ah in Europe
and ah North America are involved in some form of quality
program <#\>So as for Australia we are about a third to a half
of our companies are involved in it at some level <#\>That
maybe one division down in Tasmania or where ever <#\>Ah
Europe and ah Asia are well and truly way ahead of where we
are here in the amount of quality that's being done <,> but
it's becoming a very appropriate thing to set standards
<#\>Standards in the sense of what we call quality assurance
<#\>so we have certain standards which control processes in
manufacturing in service so that <,> with once a standards program's been put in place we
can say this is the process this is the product this is what
it looks like this is the specifications and the same of
service <#\>Now government has made it mandatory for all
companies doing contract work with them to have a quality
assurance program in place <,> <#\>This will become part and
parcel of university hospitals um <#\>I'm going to do some
work with the legal profession and so they're looking at what
are the standards for solicitors so that both the customer is
served and that there is a standard which is an international
<,> level that other companies can say look we need a
solicitor in Sydney are you registered you know and if you are
we know at least what we're getting <#\>This the professions have not been open and
enthusiastic about having standards put in there <#\>It's a
little bit of a we know what we're doing kind of thing but
that's becoming an ah old fashioned thing <#\>So that companies that really go places professional ah
partnerships that go places will be ones that will
have standards in place <#\>Standards is the base
<#\>Standards is not the end of the conversation <#\>It's
simply a base upon which everything else can be built <#\>I'm
not even saying it's the right base <,> but in most places it
works to have a a base or foundation
<#\>Once <,> ah standards are in place and they're established
through international standards so you can measure them
against overseas organisations then an organisation can engage
in total quality management which starts then looking at all
the processes in the organisation <#\>You prob you
probably also heard of best practise which is another
variation on the same theme <#\>It's ways of looking at what
we're doing and how can we improve it <#\>And how can we
improve it takes in how do we involve people in that process
<w>'cause</w> more and more with the flattening organisation
it's becoming imperative that more power be shared information
be shared in an organisation which is better for people anyway
<#\>There's less hierarchy <#\>There's more freedom for
individuals <#\>Um so one of the other things that keeps you
in is quality assurance <#\>Another underpinning is continuous
improvement a concept the Japanese refer to as <foreign>Haisan</foreign>
which is improvement greater improvement 
in every process <#\>So if there's an innovation there's a jump
to the to another level of performance
<#\>Western companies ah countries tend
to um bring in an innovation and that brings it to another
level of performance but once they do they stay at that level
whereas the Japanese believe once innovation comes in you make
incremental improvements on top of the innovation so there's
not this kind of ah layered level that actually ah more a
a curved line moving upwards <#\>So ah another aspect of total
quality management is customer service <#\>When we talk about
the customing quality ah total quality
management we're talking about both the internal and
external market <#\>So for the external customer we're looking
at um surveys to ask that particular end-user what do they
need what does the product need to be does it meet their
specifications <,> <#\>In the in the 
service area it gets a little bit more complicated <#\>In fact
um they need in some cases to actually anticipate what the
customer is going to want because if you're running a business
for example a hamburger ah restaurant you know the customer's
gone you know <#\>Some people fill out little forms and some
people don't and that's alright but it's not hardly representative sample <#\>It's very very
useful to anticipate you know what if I
was in that situation what would I want and how can I
extrapolate that and it the real goers in
the industry are the ones that do that <,> <#\>It's not
enough just to know it's not enough just to
respond to complaints <#\>It's appropriate to to see that the bigger picture 
<#\>Internal customers with customer service are other
departments <,> or in in in some
ways also the suppliers of your raw materials <#\>They need to
have a quality system in place and be looking at continuous
improvement as well or what you will get when you make your
product up is inconsistent quality ok <#\>So there's certain
methods that um <,,> total quality management's about and it
maybe limiting the number of suppliers <#\>Buying based on <,>
consistency and ss high standard actually
reduces your cost over time <#\>Going for the cheapest of
what's on sale actually reduces your performance over time <,>
<#\>Not just performance in quality but performance in cost
<#\>You know I can explain that but but I
won't <,> <#\>The other aspect is involvement <#\>Something
that I have <#\>I work with <O>inaudible</O> consultants
because I'm not a <O>inaudible</O> consultant <#\>I'm an
organisational change consultant but I find the
<O>inaudible</O> consultants have usually engineering
backgrounds so they love the little boxes and the lines
<#\>They think it's great <#\>It looks good and the idea they
just somehow or other they know certain training's needed so
you put people in a room and you train them <#\>Solved the
problem right <#\>You've solved the problem if the objective
is simply to put information in the heads of people <#\>If you
want change in behaviour you're talking about something else
<,> <#\>Even university's seem to fall into that trap of ah if
you give them the information then they'll manage it
appropriately but they don't <#\>Why don't they <#\>Because
there's rewards in the system that's there <#\>There's people
in <O>inaudible</O> with them that keep the whole thing in
place and all that so if they're not addressed what you find
is behaviour doesn't change um also internal and external
rewards <#\>Now this brings up the idea of involvement <#\>For
it to really succeed the <O>inaudible</O> program needs
involvement people <,> <#\>Now involvement's got to be real
involvement <#\>It can't be um <,> pseudo-involvement <#\>So
in some organisations in our culture which is based on still
the same hierarchy maybe smaller units but basically still
hierarchal <#\>It's still theory X values <O>inaudible nine
syllables</O><#\>You would find that they come along with a
quality system and they wack it in and then the culture shapes
the intervention and so <O>inaudible</O> just becomes another
process of you stick it in one end and it comes out the other
or it doesn't <,> <#\>So how do you companies look at that
<#\>The majority will say look we need a quality system let's
get on with it but some will say well wait a minute maybe that
won't do it maybe we need to look at other things and what if you work it well you can actually show
all the other cracks up in the system <#\>So when you go in to
set the system up in place you start off with a survey and the
survey should be slanted towards not whether or not they're
ready for quality <,> system but whether or not they are
committed to having improvement <,> and yeah</I>
