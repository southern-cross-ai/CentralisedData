<I><$A> <#\>The pressure is on Katunarich <#\><?>He's</?> two
down <#\>he's under the head <#\>Is he gonna cut one out
<#\>He'll need to stop <#\>Yes he has <#\><?>And yet</?> Parella
still holds one <O>noise</O>and a bowl to play
<$B> <#\>Options for Rob Parella of course is an open draw on the
forehand or better still he'd be looking at turning his own shot
bowl onto the jack <#\>Possibility of three shots
<$A> <#\>So Corella has fallen away <O>anthropophonic</O>
<#\>Well that ball's too wide <#\>So one shot to Parella <#\>the
score is eighteen to fourteen
<O>ONE MINUTE COMMERCIAL BREAK</O>
<$A> <#\>So Rob Parella three shots away from victory has decided
to shorten the length of this end and that is right under the
green <#\>It'd be just marginally over the minimum twenty-one
point four metres required <#\>Katunarich will be conscious
Parella's three shots for victory <#\>Needed a close bowl but has
run a couple of metres past <#\>This is Rob Parella <#\>Now
Katunarich <O>inaudible</O> draw shot <#\>But he would dearly
love to have shot after this bowl has come to rest
<#\><?>Well</?> it needs to fall in and it's close for shot
<$B> <#\>Rob Parella'll be looking at drawing to the last bowl
of Katunarich on his backhand for shot should he arrive to
Katunarich's back bowl <#\>Could well hold gain
<$A> <#\>And Grahame Richards <#\>Who has the shot
<$C> <#\>Uh Dennis has the shot Steve
<$A> <#\>Can Parella draw shot for this one <#\>Yes he can <#\>So
that's one <#\>And now Katunarich will consider a trial of the
jack for two or three <#\>Or sitting the shot bowl will do
<$C?> <#\>Oh give it back
<$A> <#\>Give it back he said
<$A?> <#\>Well Rob Parella holds one
<$A> <#\>Rob Parella <#\>His last bowl on this end <#\>Turn his
own ball in <#\>And if he runs through he could make three
which'll make their match
<$B> <#\>Will he
<$A> <#\>Well that is now a very interesting situation <#\>And
that bowl from Rob Parella turning th front bowl <#\>Grahame
Richards <#\>Could he be holding <O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>No Steve
<$A> <#\>So it's two for Rob Parella
<$B> <#\>Katunarich with two options here <#\>Electing to draw
to the Parella shot bowl on his backhand or play the forehand
draw through the two short bowls <#\>Trail the jack could be two
<$A> <#\>So Katunarich has decided to draw to the shot bowl of
Parella's <#\>'T's wide <#\>So Rob Parella picks up two important
shots and advances to a lead of twenty to fourteen <#\>Will this
man advance to the final play-off in the Jack High Series
<#\>Requiring just one <#\>And that is a good one <#\>Katunarich
looking for a close bowl <#\>He can trail a jack or he can sit
<?>the</?> shot bowl of Parella's
<$A?> <#\>Has he peeled his jack off <#\>Yes he has
<$A> <#\>And a good bowl from Dennis Katunarich
<$D> <#\>How far short would mine be please <#\>Jack high
<$E> <#\>Beg yours
<$D> <#\>My bowl <#\>How far short <?>o'</?> jack high
<$E> <#\>'Bout twelve inches
<$A> <#\>Good bowl from Katunarich but Parella still holds shot
<$D?> <#\>Oh <O>inaudible</O> <?>fair mate</?> <#\><?>Unfair</?>
<#\><?>Shorter</?> <#\>'T's lovely
?? <#\>Well <O>inaudible</O> please Grahame <#\>Up or down mate
?? <#\>Down
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> Katunarich contemplates a change
<#\>Decides to stick with the backhand <#\>He needs to get under
the front bowl of Parella's <#\>And the trail of the jack will
make two <#\>Well this time he's under <#\>Parella still holds
shot <#\>Two bowls each to play <#\>Could this be the final end
in this semi-final
<$B> <#\>Well Parella'll be looking at getting a close bowl here
either playing onto his own short bowl or just inside it <#\>He
may well elect to play the forehand to cover the Katunarich trail
shot
<$A> <#\>So the bowl is on it's way from Rob Parella <#\>He's
going to cover the trail or attempting to <#\><?>Well</?> that's
not a bad position bearing in mind that this man holds match
<$B> <#\>Katunarich with two options either staying with his
backhand trying to come under the Parella shot bowl or playing
the open forehand as half a metre for shot
<$A> <#\>So the open forehand for Katunarich <#\>You need a close
one Dennis <#\>Will you make it <#\><?>That</?> dropped short
<#\>Parella still holds gain <#\>Just one bowl left for this man
Katunarich <#\>Now Rob Parella <#\>A nice close one'd do me
<#\>I'll bet that's what he's thinking <#\>And yes that is a good
bowl for Rob Parella <#\>So Katunarich is on the forehand <#\>And
he needs half a metre <O>inaudible</O> on his last bowl <#\>Now
this is an important one for you Dennis Katunarich <#\>If you not
there you're out of this competition <O>applause</O>
<#\><O>inaudible</O> you kept your hopes alive <#\>What a great
bowl from Katunarich <?>to remain in</?> <O>inaudible</O>
<?>stats</?> <#\>The score is twenty to fifteen
<O>15 SECOND COMMERCIAL BREAK</O>
<$A> <#\><?>Now</?> Dennis Katunarich is five shots behind Rob
Parella and he desperately hangs on <#\>Parella requiring one for
victory
<$B> <#\>Important here for Katunarich to get close with his
first bowl to keep the pressure on Parella <#\>And he's done just
that <#\>It's a great start
<$A> <#\>Parella <#\>A switch to the forehand <#\>He's been
playing the backhand reasonably well so can he adapt <#\>Can he
ever <#\>It's a great try but still the orange <?>disk</?> bowl
of Katunarich remains shot <#\>And Katunarich follows him down
<#\>You wouldn't wanna touch the jack here Dennis <#\>It'll give
it away <#\>Will it fall there <#\>well it doesn't have to <#\>So
it's still shot
<$D> <#\>Only one there Grahame
<$E> <#\>Just the one I think Rob
<$D> <#\>And how far behind is the shot bowl
<$E> <#\>Nine inches to jack high
<$A> <#\>So Parella switches back to his favourite backhand
<$B> <#\>Parella will be looking at arriving to the Katunarich
shot bowl anxiously looking at it <#\>'T's not there he says
<#\>And that may well force Katunarich onto the backhand also
<$A> <#\>There's Katunarich on the backhand <#\>A sit of the bowl
of Parella's or a trail of the jack will give him three <#\>Can
you trail the jack for three Dennis Katunarich <#\>Can you
<#\>Yes you can <#\>What a magnificent bowl from the West
Australian <#\>He holds three shots
<#\>Magnificent switch to the backhand there from Dennis
Katunarich trailing the jack three shots <#\>Dennis Katunarich
a marvellous trail <#\>You've got three <#\>This'll keep you in
the game <#\>How does it look
<$F> <#\>The only problem is <?>Rob he's</?> got two uh two bowls
and he's got a straight hit at it too <#\>And if he gets this
right they'll all <?>disappear</?>
<$A> <#\>So here's the drive from Rob Parella <#\>They'll all go
said Dennis
<#\>Onto the jack and launches away <#\>That's a dead end
<$C> <#\>Parella renowned as the best driver in the world and
does he demonstrate it
<$B?> <#\>Dennis Katunarich <O>inaudible</O> entertaining game
of bowls <#\>But he's hanging onto this game <#\>And he needs a
good start <#\>That's quite a good start for Katunarich
<$A> <#\>Rob Parella <#\>Just one is all that's required
<$B> <#\>Parella very close here looking at it intently <#\>Quite
happy with that bowl
<$A> <#\>Katunarich is down game a- as it stands <#\>He's got to
reach this to turn the shot bowl of Parella's out or trail a jack
<#\>And he's finished just short of jack high <#\>Needed to reach
<$D?> <#\>'Bout three inches short o' jack high <#\>And uh Dennis
has bowled behind there
<$E> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <?>Yes</?> behind <O>inaudible</O>
<$D> <#\>That the closest one
<$E> <#\>Yes Rob
<$A> <#\>Rob Parella holding gain
<$B> <#\>And Steve Parella would dearly love to just trail this
jack around the corner out of sight of Katunarich
<$A> <#\>Well that bowl stops a little short <#\>So Katunarich
still has a chance <#\>Now this time he must reach the head and
sit the shot bowl <O>inaudible</O> trail a jack <#\>Well the
weight's better <#\>This time a little wide <#\>So Parella still
holds shot <#\>It's desperation time for you Dennis Katunarich
<#\>You need the jack this time
<$F> <#\>Yeah the bowl will <O>inaudible</O> situation is <#\>Now
of course <O>inaudible</O>
?? <#\>Mmm <#\><O>inaudible</O>  would be a nice result
<?>though</?> <#\><?>Of course</?> with weight on their hand all
all the time I've played on this <?>rink</?> uh <#\>It tends to
<O>inaudible</O> happen more than what you expect
<$A> <#\>So the bowl from Parella is on it's way <#\>Will he go
for some cover or sit the bowl <#\>Well he's turned the bowl over
<#\>And still Katunarich has second shot <#\>But he needs shot
<#\>Now Dennis Katunarich will this be your last bowl in this
tournament <#\>You need to sit the shot bowl <#\>You need to
trail the jack <#\>Otherwise it's exit Dennis Katunarich <#\>Now
will he get the shot bowl <#\>Will he get a result off this
<#\>No he hasn't <#\>So Rob Parella scores the one required for
victory in advance on to the Jack High Final winning this match
over Dennis Katunarich twenty-one to fifteen
<$A> <#\>The final bowl from Dennis Katunarich <#\>He needed a
result <#\>He's just <?>under</?> the head <#\>Runs away
<#\>Parella remains with shot for the match <#\>Both players now
join Max Walker down on the green
<$G> <#\>Well thanks very much fellas <#\>Now we have uh a final
complete <#\>And two semis are over <#\>Bad luck Dennis <#\>I
mean he got away to a great start didn't he
<$F> <#\>Yeah <#\>He played extremely well uh early in the game
and I I struggled <O>inaudible</O> a little bit <#\>And uh then
he got out to six nil and I think that was the end margin <#\>Um
I sort o' got <O>inaudible</O> prob'ly a couple o' times but uh
never quite close enough
<$G> <#\>Okay Rob let's get serious <#\>Mark McMahon a replay of
the gold-medal event at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland
<$D> <#\>Yes <#\>Just under two years ago Max so uh this is
another game next week <#\>I just hope that uh I can practise a
bit more and play as good as I played today <#\>And again a good
game
<$G> <#\>I think it will be a good game <#\>Thanks again Dennis
for your contribution to the tournament <#\>Good luck next week
too Rob <#\>So don't forget that one Mark McMahon Rob Parella
<#\>The final of Jack High <#\>One not to be missed</I>
<&>15 SECONDS OF MUSIC</&>

<S2A-005b> <383>
<I><$A> <#\>His hand over the ball is being pushed around a
little
bit by the breeze<,,> <#\>Times appears to be gusting anything
up to
twenty knots<,,>
<$B> <#\>Here's a great reply by Trevor Morris
<$A> <#\>Oh that's very good contact on the jack and<,> mmm one
maybe
two shots<,,>
<$B> <#\>Everyone else gonna be looking to<,> come up with enough
weight to sit the shot ball  <#\>Even if he misses it<,,> it
should
come through behind the jack<,,>
<$A> <#\>He's almost drawn shot<,,> <#\>The breeze is gusting
quite
strongly<,,> and as Trevor Morris delivers this his last bowl<,,>
you could be excused<,,> for making a mistake<,,> 
<$B> <#\>Oh be a very gentle draw shot from Gary Lawson holding
one<,,> yeah very gentle  <#\>This is gonna stop some metre and
a
half short<,,> <#\>One to Garry Lawson<,> <#\>He takes the score
to two
Trevor Morris three
<$A> <#\>Craig Lawson<,,> evening this third set<,> but at least
now
in control of the map and back to his favoured longer ends<,,>
another two three<,,> next few ends will give us a very clear
indication as to who is likely to make it through this match with
win or keep alive their semi-final chances<,,>
<$B> <#\>And the way this section is panning out the loser will
have
none<,> or next to none chance of qualifying  <#\>They both
realise
that<,,> <#\>Even if the conditions are very difficult  <#\>Maybe
a bit
of luck will come to bear in the result of this game<,,> <#\>And
Gary
Lawson<,> worried about that last ball of Trevor Morris's has
switched to the forehand<,,> nuh with the result that we've seen
so often out there short narrow<,,> <#\>Trevor with probably a
metre
and a half two metres to add another counter<,,>
<$A> <#\>Well Trevor also has gone out to the forehand but he's
had
the luxury of watching what happened to Gary Lawson's<,> bowl and
he said I think I'll play something similar <#\>Short and narrow
<$B> <#\>This would be a good end if the jack was two metres
shorter<,,> but<,> it isn't<,,> 
<$A> <#\>Well maybe the first one to catch this hand<,,> bit a
bit
a long way towards winning this game  <#\>Gary hates this<,,>
<#\>This
is shorter than any of the others<,,>
<$B> <#\>That wind is obviously having an effect on that forehand
away from the club Geoff<,,>
<$A> <#\>Oh it's certainly having an effect</I>
