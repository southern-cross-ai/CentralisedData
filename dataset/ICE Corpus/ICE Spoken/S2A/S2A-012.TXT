<I><$A> <#\>I would uh <,> <O>1 syll</O> thank the <,> the R A M for
inviting me <,> uh and given me <,,> a pri- privilege to
judge these cattle <#\>We've uh <,> just been through <,,> three
days of judging <,,> <#\>Sixteen judges <,,> thirty four breeds
of beef cattle <,,> and some fifteen hundred head of beef
cattle <,> have been through these rounds <,> <#\>The <O>1 syll</O>
are probably well and truly <O>4 syll</O> judges <,> and <O>1 syll</O>
<,,> about their cattle <#\>But <,,> <O>1 syll</O> <,> that uh
where we've got <O>2 syll</O> we've got the <O>2 syll</O> <,> <#\>The
opportunity is for them to <,> display them to you <,,> <#\>Uh
for me the <O>1 syll</O> having the <,,> <O>3 syll</O> <,,> uh task
declare a winner of <,,> what we're looking at this evening
<,,> <#\>Then again the <O>1 syll</O> beef beef cattle get the uh <,,>
<O>4 syll</O> <#\>I think <,> when we <,> really look round the rink
we've got uh a variety of cattle <,> <#\>Uh <,,> we've got some
tremendously large cattle <,,> <O>1 syll</O> cattle <,,>
cattle with uh <,,> a a <,> tremendous amount of femininity
in the in the females strength and masculinity in the bulls
<,> <#\>I think <,,> <O>4 syll</O> <,,> <O>1 syll</O> gratitude to
our beef beef breeders of Australia <,> <#\>And I think before I
go any further I'd like you <,> to join me and and thank them
for contributing <,> to our meat industry (applause) <,,> <#\>I
can assure you I feel very very uh proud a- and humbled to be
<,> asked to make this this <,,> <O>2 syll</O> <,,><quote>how
would you be <,> selected to get this job</quote> <#\>And I said<quote>Well
uh <,> prob'ly I live the furthest away from Sydney</quote> 
<,,> <#\>I really think this is part of
the plan that I can't get away with <O>10 syll</O> <#\>They're going
to hang on to me <,,> <#\>But I would just like to make
<,> a uh <,,> a bit of a scan with reference to the to the
beef cattle as I've seen them <,,> <#\>Uh to the industry
requirements as I see it <,> and the changes of what we've
seen in the industry <,> uh <,> in in since I've been involved
and uh <,> with my hat on you mightn't think it's so long
<#\>When I take it off you'll know it's a long time <,,> <#\>But
<,,> I've seen the cattle go through the fifties when they
were as we've all heard the belly button button cattle <#\>And I-
I've got cattle out here today that <,> I would refer to as
belly button button cattle uh because I can only see their
belly buttons <,> <#\>They're tremendously <,,> uh big cattle
<,> <#\>But I think <,> what has changed and I'm so pleased to see
the change that I think <,> in the uh <,> early eighties <,>
we were had this influence <,> that we had to be big <,> and
we had to be heavy <,> to be any good <,> <#\>And uh I'm just so
pleased to see that <,> a great combination <,> of beef &
scale has been contributed <,> into supplying <,> what I think
our beef industry needs <,,> <#\>The cattle have been uh greatly
cleaned up <#\>They've become efficient <,> <#\>They've be- they've
got carcase cuts <,> that meet our market requirements and
specifications <,> and I really do think <,> that unless we're
going to take on board <,> what the industry needs <,> uh our
stud breeders <,> and producers <,> are going to get further
apart <,> <#\>I'm just so proud to have been involved <,> in the
industry <,> during a time when I think the uh <,,> the
pedigree stud breeders <,> and the commercial breeders <,>
have really got so much closer an understanding <,> what the
industry needs <,> <#\>I'd just like to make <,> a bit of a scan
comment on the cattle as I see them <,> <#\>When I look at the
Angus cattle <,> and I've seen them go through <,> uh many
stages in probably fifteen years <,> <#\>And I think you we've
got a combination of <,> size and scale and muscle in the <O>1
syll</O> masculinity <,> he moves well <,> and I think he's a
bull that's uh <,> really a good example of the breed <,>
<#\>We've got a female that's oozing in femininity <,> She's
soft <,> <#\>She's uh <,,> what I think uh <,> really is uh <O>5
syll</O> in any way <#\>Of course uh we'd be looking to <,> see her
with the calf on her next year and showing herself to the best
ability <,,> <#\>We've come to the uh <,> the beef shorthorn and
a breed <,> that has been uh bred and probably not <,> gone
into the changes that many of the other breeds <,> have uh <O>6
syll</O> <,> <#\>But for sure they've got a place in the industry
and their breeders to contribute to <,> <#\>We've got a bull
that's got great shape <,>he stands on sound legs great
testicles <,> and he's a really masculine looking bull <#\>A
lovely soft female a young cow <,> good udder <,> and doing
the job that we all hope she'll uh be able to do for her
calves <,> <#\>We go on to the uh <O>5 syll</O>type cattle <,> uh <,>
the <O>2 syll</O> a lovely bull a really uh attractive <O>3 syll</O>
<#\>You get behind him the width <,> there's thickness around and
yet he's nice and fine on the shoulders <,> <#\>I feel that the
<O>1 syll</O> prob'ly uh <,,> the the cow is is prob'ly hasn't got
as many points on the board as the bull <,> <#\>We go to the
Brahmans <,> uh a good combination of of <,> what I <O>1 syll</O>
regard as middle of the road <,> cattle on the day <#\>They're
not extreme in any way <#\>We've got a sound bull <,> <#\>He's got a
<,> many at- attributes of the Brahman breed <,> and a lovely
female <#\>A soft <,> beautiful teat formation and a great udder
<,> <#\>And when you get behind her she's got uh <,> a great <,,>
width of <O>1 syll</O> bones and knees of calving and I can see in
my mind she's a great feminine cow <,,> <#\>The <O>3 syll</O> is an
upstanding bull <,> <#\>I really was impressed the way this bull
s- s- d- uh walk out towards me <#\>There's plenty of room
between his legs <,> and he's well balanced <,> <#\>A lovely
feminine heifer behind him <,> very young but absolutely
stocked uh <,> chock with quality of beef and femininity and
and <,> and female attributes <,,> <#\>The <O>2 syll</O> breed which
we don't prob'ly see a great deal of or I don't <,> and yet
I'm very impressed with what I see in the <O>3 syll</O> <,> <O>3
syll</O> champion bull <,> <#\>A bull that covers a great deal of
ground <#\>He's very masculine very sound testicles <,> uh <,>
and and the cow that's soft and feminine and and a great
mothering ability <#\>I think they're a very neat team and and
represent their breed so well <,,> <#\>We m- we move on to
the <,,> uhm <,,> <O>noise</O> <,,> the <O>2 syll</O> <,> and
we've got a <O>2 syll</O> which to me that's got a great top line
very very strong <,,> uhm <,> beef right right throughout <,>
<#\>And I can see that some of these uh <,> European breeds we we
did have <,> what I regarded as commercial problems <#\>But when
we look at an animal like that <,> he's lean in the shoulders
<#\>He's carrying a great deal of meat <,> <#\>He's got good
testicles <,> adequate bones <,> <#\>And he's followed by a
beautifully soft female <,> <#\>Just on the way to what she's all
about <,> <#\>She's uh well in calf <,> nice udder formation and
letting down well <,,> <#\>We move on to the established breeds
and the Herefords <,> and the breed that's been in this rink
for many years and uh <,> I'm very proud to <,,> be standing
before them here today <,,> <#\>Uh a great bull a bull with a
great deal of outlook <,,> strength <#\>And I think <,> uh
moderate in frame<O>3 syll</O> to to beef requirements <,> <#\>He's
carrying a <,> plenty of adequate amount of beef <#\>And I get
behind him and I like the thickness right throughout <,> <#\>A
good set of testicles <,> <#\>And I think a bull with a lot of uh
maturity <#\>We move on to the cow that's following that team
<#\>And w an older cow a more mature cow <,,> uh a cow that <,,>
has a great frame sm- frame <#\>She's got tremendous pelvic uh
<,> room and a great deal of leg from the the the hip to the
<O>1 syll</O> <#\>And I think a <,> a really matronly type animal
<,,> <#\>We move on to the <,> the <O>3 syll</O> <#\>And again we've got
this uh really strong muscled animal <#\>Uh <,,> a a a a bull
that's uh very strong and he's compact <#\>He moves well <,> <#\>And
only a young bull and he's uh <,> and and we have in many of
these bulls we've got uh just two-year-old bulls <,> and on
the thousand kilos and they're all round the ring <#\>And I think
that is just a <,> an absolute great achievement when we see
the mobility and the freedom that they can handle <,,> <#\>The
female behind him <,> really uh <,> explains to me what
femininity <,> uh motherness and kindliness is all about <#\>I
think she's a cow with a <,> with a great deal going for her
<O>5 syll</O> a a a bull that again that I haven't seen a great
deal of <#\>But we've got softness <#\>We've got beef <#\>We've got a
combination of muscle <,> and uh and fat cover <,> <#\>I th- I
think that they've certainly got a role <,> and uh the
challenge there would be the marketing <,> them at the right
place that their market <O>3 syll</O> <#\>A lovely soft heifer <,>
following that bull <,> and again with a great deal of
femininity <,,> <#\><O>3 syll</O> is a very very strong bull massive
bull when you get behind him <#\>And I hope that uh <,> some of
these cattle that you look at <#\>And prob'ly many people did see
them in their judging <,> <#\>I've just seen them today for the
first time <,> <#\>And he's such a s- strong bull a mountain of
beef <,> <#\>And yet carrying adequate uh <,> fat cover for him
and yet uh can still handle it round the rink <,> <#\>A very nice
female <,> b- uh with the calves behind her <,> <#\>She's finer
and more mellow <,> and showing a great deal of softness and
femininity <,> <#\>The <O>3 syll</O> specials which are <,> are
represented by a younger bull but a very very <O>2 syll</O> a well-
balanced bull and I think a good <,> free-moving bull with uh
<,> a lot going for his his his breed <#\>He's a <,> bull for his
age a great set of testicles <#\>And I think we've really got to
look <,> at these points <,> uh that that's where <,> all the
production and what's going to follow on starts <,> <#\>And
surely it'll start when he turns round and has a look behind
him <,> and sees a magnificent cow <,> a cow with <,> <O>2 syll</O>
<,,> absolutely stacked full of volume <,> <#\>She's got capacity
and room in the pelvic area <#\>And again a cow really well worth
having a look at <,> whether she's uh red white blue or
whatever <#\>I think she's a great beef animal <#\>We move to the
Murray Grey <,> our own Australian breed and a <,> and a bull
<O>2 syll</O> leading them <,> that uh <,,> in I can feel the <O>4
syll</O> all our markets domestic markets the Japanese market <,>
and and supplying to what's you know in the six hundred and
fifty <,> six hundred and uh and seven hundred kilo range <,>
<#\>And you judge stock <O>3 syll</O> on domestic markets <O>2 syll</O>
<,,> <#\>And uh evenly coloured as that and <,> a bull with a
great deal of strength <,> <#\>An older cow following in that
crew <,> and uh <,> she's uh <,,> quite obviously done a
great job in her in her breeding career <#\>She's rearing a calf
well now <,> <#\>And uh <,,> I c- I can see <,> that probably <,>
she had <O>8 syll</O> uh <,> and uh <O>5 syll</O> now <,> <#\>We move to <O>3
syll</O> Hereford with a massive bull in front of us <,> uh <,,>
and I've <,> really gotta <O>1 syll</O> my <O>2 syll</O> when I see
great big cattle <,> <#\>I I look at them prob'ly a little bit
more critically <,> to see that they can handle themselves and
parade well <,> <#\>And uh this will please me <,> just so much
as I saw him come down the white line <,> <#\>He's followed by a
<,> a very <,,> large grey female and yet again a a a female
that I <,> am sure <,> maintains femininity and mothering
ability <O>1 syll</O> <#\>I think they're a fine team <,,> <#\>We
move to the uh <O>2 syll</O> and uh a young bull that really did
impress me <#\>I love his muscle <,> pattern <,> I think his uh
<,> his softness <,> <#\>And I think a a calf that's going to
give a a a great deal to the breeder that owns him <#\>He's
followed by a <,> and a very nice soft cow a a good mothering
type cow <,> <#\>And I think <O>1 syll</O> <,> <O>3 syll</O> a complete
team and represent their breed well</I>
