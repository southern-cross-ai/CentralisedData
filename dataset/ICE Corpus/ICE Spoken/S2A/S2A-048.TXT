<I><$A> <#\>Ladies and gentlemen can I have your attention please 
<#\>We'd like to begin the formalities for the evening<,>
<#\>We're
we're very glad that you've enjoyed the er rich ambience of
the occasion here in front of a church that was built in the
eighteen seventies and er thoroughly enjoyed the nineteen
seventies ambience of the music that's been playing<,> so
peace love and bliss to you all on this wonderful occasion
where we've had the opportunity to to launch this fantastic
Paddington Bazaar book by Michael Mangold 

<#\>It's my privilege to begin these proceedings er I'm Rod
Pattenden the present minister of of this church and it's been
my er joy and er my duty to be er minister of this church for
the last nine years and to in a sense be executive officer of
the running of this Paddington Bazaar <#\>In the first week of
my
settlement here we were delivered with a notice from the then
Sydney Council indicating that the markets needed to close
because it was running illegally apparently in nineteen
seventy three <#\>The Paddington Bazaar was given six months
trial
to see how it would go by the Sydney Council and lo and behold
they never came back <O>audience laughs</O> until the local
aldermen found something in a file somewhere and that we were
delivered with that notice <#\>This year we celebrate twenty
years of er identity as the Paddington Bazaar <#\>From some
amoeba like beginning to uh what it's grown to be probably the
premier market in Australia if not the world <O>audience
laughter and clapping</O> <#\>The premier market in the world
<O>laughter cheering</O> <#\>Thank you <#\>You certainly get
feedback
from uh people who travel overseas <#\>They keep telling us that
Paddington Bazaar is the most unusual and  exciting mix of
interesting stalls <#\>The priority we give to new stallholders
is er original handmade arts and crafts and fashion so that
makes Paddington bazaar the most exciting and interesting
bazaar market of its kind in Australia <O>audience calls
yes</O>  

<#\>Today we are here to launch the book as part of our twentieth
anniversary er of the existence of the markets and to
acknowledge the fine work of Michael Mangold and his team from
Camden er Mark's singers and er all the team for the fine work
they've done in bringing the book to completion <#\>But of course
the er fundamental part of that equation is this fantastic
product that Paddington bazaar is maddening unusual um
difficult to understand animal that exists every Saturday
whether it rains or it er hails or it shines here on this site
in the church grounds and the school grounds <#\>Many people
find it difficult to understand that such a community
cooperation can exist between a church which is always un er
always known for its conservative er views also for its er a
school which is meant to deal with only small children of
course and also community members who er exhibit their works
here as part of uh their uh role as stallholders <#\>Paddington
bazaar is an unusual animal <#\>It is unique in the history of
community cooperation in this place and I guess the book that
Michael Mangold has produced gives tribute to the many
hundreds of people er from church and the community the school
and all the unusual stallholders that have gathered under the
banner of Paddington bazaar 

<#\>So it's my pleasure to er welcome you here to encourage you
to
buy a copy of this magnificent black and white colour graphic
descrip description of this wonderful phenomenon Paddington
bazaar which has given so much life to Paddington which has
recreated the shopping strip of Paddington which has given er
new life to community projets projects such as er the inside
community uh welfare centre and contributes to the welfare of
the Paddington school <#\>To launch the book tonight um I'd like
to invite Lizzie Collins who is one of those people who have
graduated from stallholder status to infamy <O>audience
titters</O> in the book and she will read an introduction
<#\>Michael Mangold er describes her as the high priestess of
fashion  so er I pass over from a minister of religion to the
high priestess of fashion <O>laughter clapping</O>  <#\>Lizzie
Collins <O>clapping</O>

<&>next speaker non corpus so omitted</&></I>

<I><$A> <#\>And it uh will be very few words <O>audience
laughs</O> <#\>As a photographer I like to watch <O>audience
laughs</O> <#\>Lizzie said that it's a great place to watch people
and and it is <#\>It's a photographer's paradise <#\>I could have
spent the rest of my life well the rest of my Saturdays of my
life wandering around here and I I would never have run out of
material <#\>Hopefully uh in this book I've captured the the
spirit of the bazaar <#\>In reality I've only just scratched the
surface <#\>Uh it's uh the bazaar's an evolving growing um moving
beast that uh I would defy anybody to uh def define
completely<,> <O>audience laughter</O> <#\>As I said Paddington
bazaar is a photographer's paradise <O>audience laughter</O>
but you have to be patient <O>audience laughter</O> and you do
need to spend time getting to know these unique beings
stallholders before you can really do them justice and do
yourself justice by getting good shots <#\>The first couple of
weeks I was here I I just walked around and around and I I was
in such a daze I really couldn't see anything at all <#\>But as
I started to tune in to the the vibe and the the rhythms and
and patterns of the bazaar each week over the year and a half
I eventually reached a point where um photography was no
longer a a problem but the the time to uh to capture all of
these stallholders was <#\>In in the end I didn't manage to
photograph the the two hundred and fifty stallholders and so
I've left room for somebody else to uh pick up where I've left
off <#\>Um thank you very much Rod for your kind words and
Lizzie it was wonderful of you to accept the invitation um 
<#\>There's a little more about Lizzie in this book and there's a
a lot more about other people and one of the the things that
you'll find the about this book that you<,> it's the
opportunity to take a good long hard look at what a
stallholder actually uh is and looks like because we come here
on on Saturday um as many of you probably do  you'll just be
amazed at how much activity there is <#\>Thank you very much 
<O>audience claps and cheers</O></I>



<S2A-048c> <148>
<I><$A> <#\>I'd just like to express my appreciation to Michael
for the wonderful working relationship that we've had in
producing the book and for <@>Forename Surname</@> and also to all
the people who contributed to the history of the market to uh
Laurie Matthews and the Reverend Rex Matthews the Reverend
Russell Davies and I think I have one question to ask Russell
if he would please come out the front <#\>Russell Davies is the
minister of this Methodist Church in nineteen seventy three
when the market first started <#\>For eight weeks in a row last
year one of the local residents rang me up every morning at
six thirty to ask me why he'd been woken up by the noisy
wheels of stallholders wheeling their stalls to the markets 
<#\>Why in hell Rex uh sorry Russell did you start this market
is
the question I wanted to put to you</I>



<S2A-048d> <735>
<I><$A> <#\>Um because it was obvious there was a need for it <#\>I
I'm
going to I'm a journalist by background so I'll do what
journalists always do I'll ignore the question he asked me and
tell me what I wanted to tell you anyway but it's got nothing
to do with that <#\>Two stories uh I've got <#\>One which I was
planning on telling you and and one which Rod has stirred in
my mind <#\>Uh the one that I was planning on telling you uh
once I got here and started to enjoy the uh whoever put on 
the uh uh the bits uh you know the finger food and whatnots uh
thank you very much and standing there with a glass of red in
my hand I thought gee things certainly have changed since
nineteen seventy three <#\>We had just set up the uh uh pergolas
on the sides we had a grand total of sixteen stalls at that
stage <#\>We were about to expand to thirty two <#\>We thought
we
were big time<,> <#\>And uh we had a number of musicians used to
come around The White Company for anybody who's into nostalgia
right and uh the Rainbow people and uh anyway they used to
come and play in the plaza <,,> <#\>And I had this idea and I
wrote to Council ah we we're under the City Council then eh
and I said eh eh <quote>there is only one house in Newcomb street
number two</quote> which at that stage was the manse and my wife and
I were the occupants <quote>can we have permission to close off
Newcomb street on the first Saturday of each month</quote> <#\>All the
streets in this side were open at that stage <quote>we want
permission to close off Newcomb street on the first Saturday
of each month to hold an ethnic festival in connection with
the markets and we'll start off with a Greek one we'll have
Greek food Greek music Greek dancing <#\>Um next month it'll be
Italian then Spanish etcetera</quote> <#\>And about a fortnight later
I
got this letter back eh which said <quote>Stop closing off Newcomb
Street <#\>Stop holding these ethnic festivals and close down
that illegal market you don't have permission to run it
anyway</quote> <#\>This was about six months we've been running <#\>And
I
thought <quote>Ah I'll show him</quote> <#\>So I went in there with the plans
and eh I said eh <quote>There you are there's your Council stamp on
our plans</quote> <#\>And they said <quote>oh that's a building approval you
don't have a development approval <#\>You've got permission to
build a market you don't have permission to run a market</quote> 
<O>audience laughs</O> <#\>I said <quote>Why the hell do you think we
would build it if we weren't going to run it</quote> <#\> <quote>Well we have
complaints from local residents about parking</quote> <#\>If you want
to
know how we resolve those you'll have to come on Saturday I'll
tell that story on Saturday <#\>And eh Rod is not quite right
when he says eh <quote>It was illegal but then they forgot about
it</quote> <#\>I'll tell you how we actually persuaded them to forget
about it <#\>After we'd solved the problem of the eh parking
which you'll have to come on Saturday to hear about they were
still eh writing to us regularly and finally they gave us a
deadline <#\> <quote>If you don't close the market by Saturday the you
know 30th of whatever eh we will come and close you down</quote> <,>
<#\>So I eh phoned them up and said eh <quote>Could you tell us what
time you're going to come round to close us down please</quote> um
 <quote>we</quote> and they said <quote>no</quote> and I said <quote>well if you could let us
know on Saturday morning if you could give us at least two
hours notice we'd appreciate it</quote> <#\> <quote>What do you mean</quote> <#\> <quote>Well
we
can get the newspapers and the radio stations here in twenty
minutes but it takes two hours to get a film crew across the
bridge</quote> <#\> <quote>What do you mean what do you mean</quote> <#\> <quote>Well I'm
very
clear that our reputation in this place is much better than
yours is and you are being nasty about it and we're going to
fight it and if you try and close us down we are make you
going to make you look bad</quote> <#\>And twenty years later here we
still are good on us <O>audience laughs and claps</O></I>
