<S2A-017> <2001>
<I><$A> <#\>I guess the first thing we should tell you<,> is
there has been rain in Melbourne<,> but by the times as I join
Peter Donogan down in the mounting yard our racing host<,> by
the times being run today Pete really<,> only the sting out of
the track it would seem
<$B> <#\>That's correct Tim <#\>We're racing on a slow
surface <#\>Officially it was heavy early<,> in the day<,>
but now slow and it has disadvantaged a few but hopefully<,>
not too many <#\>Good afternoon from around the world and
welcome to this fabulous scene at Flemington Racecourse <#\>A
man<,> who has experienced this scene first hand many times
<#\>Twice<,> he was the king of Flemington in nineteen sixty
five and nineteen sixty seven<,> one of our greatest ever
jockeys in Roy Higgins <#\>And Roy I s'pose<,> it doesn't
matter if you're a jockey<,> or just a spectator<,> Melbourne
Cup Day is something special
<$C> <#\>It certainly is special I think ah<,,> it's
en jockey's dream <#\>It's a dream come
true<,> to be able to win a Melbourne Cup <#\>I think any
sportsman<,> may have an aim in life<,> and certainly<,> the
jockey's aim<,> is to win a Melbourne Cup and<,,> ah you can
just get  the chills up and down
your spine here<,> on this um<,> well unfortunately<,>
overcast day with a bit of rain around but<,> nothing dampens
the Melbourne Cup
<$B> <#\>What would the jockey's be feeling like at this very
moment?<,,> 
<$C> <#\>A lot of them'd be queuing up at the toilets I
believe <#\>It is a very nervous tension<,> in the
<w>jockeys'</w> room <#\>They are taken in <,> they are taken<,> ah
in<,> to the stewards room the stewards<,> well you could say
reads them their rights<,> what he expects them to do with
their mounts during the running of the Melbourne Cup to make
sure<,> that every jockey<,> and every horse in the race<,>
get a fair go and ah<,> then they're sent back <#\>They sit
there <#\>They study their colours <#\>They<,> look at the
other riders<,> pick out what horses they're gonna follow in
the race<,> and it's a complete involvement for anything up to
thirty minutes<,> before the stewards<,> then ask them<,>
<quote>jockeys to the mounting yard</quote> 
<$B> <#\>Roy we just had a look at the runners in the
Melbourne Cup <#\>We'll be taking a look at them<,> as they
come into the mounting yard <#\>They'll be here shortly
<#\>Tim<,> for the moment back to you
<$A> <#\>And from us<,> let's take a break <#\>Back in a
tick
          <O>ad break</O>
<$A> <#\>There's your view<,> of the great city of Melbourne
and ah<,> as I speak to you another flurry of rain has come
across the racecourse<,> and we understand too that some of
the rest of the world has actually joined us at three o'clock
so<,> here<,>
in Australia so welcome to you <#\>And now<,> we've got
international viewers from all over the place joining our
telecast <#\>Welcome to you <#\>Twenty minutes away<,> the
big race <#\>Here's Peter Donogan<,> and Roy Higgins
<$B> <#\>Thank you Tim <#\>Shortly the runners will be coming
into the mounting yard but apart from the flurry of activity
here in the mounting yard with all the owners and trainers and
the media<,> as Drum Taps leads them down<,> the<,> winner of
the last two Ascot Gold Cups <#\>There's also a flurry of
activity out in the betting ring <#\>Thousands upon thousands
of people<,> wagering millions of dollars on the Fosters
Melbourne Cup<,> and<,> our<,> expert in the betting ring Dr
Turf<,> has the latest information
<$D> <#\>Well Pete I've been to over twenty Melbourne Cups and
I've never seen a plunge like this <#\>Number one Drum Taps
has been backed for an absolute fortune <#\>It has now joined
Our Pompeii as equal favourite in the race <#\>The Phantom is
still solid <#\>Sub Zero completely out the gate but ah<,> a
very big go here on number one Drum Taps <#\>Probably going
to start outright favourite Pete<,> and ah all the plunges
earlier on in the day have been orchestrated by one very very
big punter <#\>I'm not sure if he's responsible for this one
but this has been a very big go
<$B> <#\>What sort of money is changing hands? <#\>Is it at ah<{1><[1><,></[1> as it normally is
doctor?
<$C> <#\><[1>Well</[1></{1>
     <#\>Well I was talking to one bookie ah<,> before Pete
and as I was talking to him an English gentleman walked up and
had<,> a hundred and twenty thousand to twenty thousand<,> on
Drum Taps<,> and ah<,> that was just one of the very
number of ah<,> ah
laid on Drum Taps Pete <#\><{2><[2>Huge game
<O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$B> <#\><[2>Well plenty of activity</[2></{2> Yeah Plenty
of activity down there in the betting ring and now these
runners are coming into the mounting yard and we just had the
opportunity of having a look at Drum Taps <#\>Probably for
many people here in Australia your first look at him <#\>But
this horse bred in the United States <#\>The winner of the
last two Ascot Gold Cups <#\>There he is<,> <#\>He's up on
his toes in the mounting yard <#\>He's a handsome individual
and Roy Higgins<,> well we've heard what Dr Turf had to say
<#\>He's had an unusual preparation <#\>Can he win the
Melbourne Cup?<,,> 
<$C> <#\>Well I s'pose it's going to be very easy to say after
the race ah one way or the other Peter <#\>It's<,>
the point being<,> have they climatised these
two horses our two international horses <#\>They've been here
in quarantine for just on a month <#\>They've had their own
working facilities<,> <#\>Drum
came out here to Flemington and worked<,> ah last Thursday
<#\>His work was absolutely magnificent <#\>Ah<,> I was quite
taken by ah<,>  his attitude towards
his work <#\>He's got a magnificent temperament and ah<,>
I'll be watching this horse with great interest <#\>I think
he's capable of performing
<$B> <#\>The reigning champion number two Sub Zero winner of
this race in similar conditions last year <#\>Greg Paulad
will again ride him <#\>The man who was aboard him last year
<#\>Trained by Lee Freedman <#\>There has been some
controversy with one of our top trainers Lee Freedman in the
last twenty four hours<,> suspended for two months after one
of his horses returned a positive swab <#\>He has appealed
and he has a stay of proceedings <#\>Sub Zero is a fit race
horse<,> but he's up in weight to fifty eight and a half
kilos <#\>He's all heart though Roy <#\>He'll give you a
great sight for your money
<$C> <#\>This horse is a genuine soft track runner <#\>He won
the Melbourne Cup here last year<,> on a soft track <#\>Ah<,>
he has not struck ah soft track or  yielding track ah since <#\>Today he gives the
track to suit again <#\>I think<,> he's got just a little bit
too much weight
<$B>  <#\>Number three<,> is Castle Town <#\>Noel Harris will
take the ride <#\>There's the horse that ran third in the
Melbourne Cup last year <#\>His lead up months haven't been
too bad and he'll be running on at the end of the race
<$C> <#\>He's a very genuine performer this horse <#\>The
conditions will suit him here today <#\>He'll give you a good
sight because he is a very honest horse
<$B> <#\>The Caulfield Cup winner number four Fraar
<#\>Darren Goutsi all the way back from Hong Kong to take the
ride <#\>Terrific run in the Caulfield Cup when he won<,> and
a very good effort on Saturday in the McKinnon
<$C> <#\>Form leading into this race for Fraar<,> has been
very good <#\>Whether he can get a strong three thousand two
hundred metres<,> is yet to be seen <#\>I believe he's got a
chance of running in the first half dozen
<$B> <#\>Number five is Tiaco Nic <#\>The rider is Bobby
Vance who won the Cox Plate the weight for age
championship of Australasia on the Phantom Chance <#\>And his
lead up Paul a bit disappointing
<$C> <#\>Been very disappointing Peter ah<,> <#\>Trained by
the daughter of the legendary T J Smith in Gaye Waterhouse
<#\>Ah he's probably going to be the pace maker in the race
<#\>If that's so<,> he'll set a good speed
<$B> <#\>Six is Vintage Crop the Irish St Ledger winner<,>
with Michael Kinnane who won the Epsom Derby on Commander in
Chief this year aboard him<,> and as I said<,,> his last start
was in the Irish St Ledger <#\>That was back on the
eighteenth of September <#\>Another question mark over him
but he's a fit horse
<$C> <#\>He is fit Peter they've had a little bit of a problem
here with this  horse <#\>It took him a week or ten days to
come onto his food <#\>He does look a shade on the light
side<,> but by gee he's a magnificent individual
<$B> <#\>Seven Assam is one of David Hazer's runners to be
ridden by Larry Cassidy
<$C> <#\>He will be suited by the soft conditions <#\>He is
a genuine stayer<,> but not a lot
of class about him
<$B> <#\>Can The Phantom<,> become the third eight year old to
win the Melbourne Cup <#\>Jim Cassidy won the race ten years
ago aboard Kiwi and takes the ride today<,> aboard this
veteran New Zealander
<$C> <#\>If the race was to be won by sheer honesty<,> this
would be the horse to take it out <#\>He's a very genuine
race horse <#\>Okay he is eight years of age <#\>He's been
off the scene for two years<,> with bad legs <#\>His win here
in the McKinnon on Saturday<,> was outstanding <#\>He'll ah<,> by these conditions today
<#\>I think<,> he's the horse to beat in the race
<$B> <#\>Trainer George Hamlin has won three Melbourne Cups
already<,> and he might make it four with Our Pompeii to be
ridden by one of Australia's champion jockeys in Mick Ditman
<$C> <#\>This is one horse that's had the real preparation to
win a<,> ah three thousand two hundred metre race <#\>It's to
be ridden by Australia's greatest horseman in Mick Ditman
<#\>I think<,> it's his day <#\>I've marked him on top
<$B> <#\>Number ten<,> is one of the New Zealand visitors in
Mercator and the rider<,> C W Johnson
<$C> <#\>He will run the distance this horse <#\>He's a
little bit inclined to be a one pacer but he will appreciate
this ah soft conditions here today
<$B> <#\>The runner up in the Caulfield Cup number eleven<,>
Air Seattle<,> ridden by one of our more controversial jockeys
in Shane Dye<,> but his run Roy in the Caulfield Cup was
outstanding
<$C> <#\>By ah mistake he missed his run here<,> ah on
Saturday which caused a bit of concern <#\>Traditionally<,>
all our Melbourne Cup horses race here on the Saturday
<#\>Ah<,> he didn't <#\>Ah he is a good horse this horse
<#\>Caulfield Cup fourth is always good for the Melbourne Cup
<#\>If this horse can<,> run the distance<,> he'll be very
hard to beat
<$B> <#\>Silgali number twelve <#\>His lead up form is pretty
good <#\>Graham Cookesley in the saddle <#\>He failed here
on Saturday <#\>Can we forgive him for one bad run?
<$C> <#\>It's hard to gi a horse
going into a Melbourne Cup <#\>He did put in ah<,> a run that
probably was nearly saying <quote>I'm at the end of my tether
<#\>I've had a hard preparation</quote> 
<$B> <#\>Number thirteen Cavalieri<,> another of the New
Zealanders<,> loomed up in the home turn in unsuitable
conditions last year <#\>He ran a gallant fifth <#\>Today he
wears the blinkers and<,> Kevin Moses takes the ride but he's
drawn badly
<$C> <#\>Big strong horse <#\>He's had something like
fourteen tries on a soft track <#\>He's yet to be placed ah
<#\>I would doubt he's ah<,> ability here<,> today because the
track is rated as slow
<$B> <#\>The Perth Cup winner number fourteen Field Officer to
be ridden by Troy Jackman<,> but his recent form indicates
that he's gonna find it very hard here
<$C> <#\>He has won over the three thoosand ah two hundred metres but his form<,>
since that race has been very disappointing</I>
