<S1B-052> <2026>
<I><$A> <#\>Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker <#\>In speaking to the
Harbour
Amendment Bill this afternoon<,> <O>Acoughs</O> first and
foremost<,,> to ah section part nine of the ah Harbour
Act<,> <#\>The amendment to the Act will allow development<,,>
and direct negotiation with the sugar board by the port
authority at Mackay<,> <#\>When this redevelopment program
commences<,,> we'll see an eighteen million dollar sugar<,,>
ah refined sugar storage and shipping facility<,> in operation
at Mackay Harbour<,> that will greatly enhance Mr Deputy
Chairman<,> the profitability of the sugar industry in
Mackay<,> in Mackay region and in North Queensland in
general<,> <O>Acoughs</O> <#\>This will be built I believe in
conjunction<,,> with a ah<,> fifty eight million dollar
refine-processing mill next to the race course mill at
Mackay<,> and ah<,> this is very gratifying for the sugar
industry of Queensland<,> because in recent times it hasn't
enjoyed very good commodity prices<,,> in ah <O>Acoughs</O>
owing mainly not only to low commodity prices but also being
compounded by severe drought conditions<,> in the far north of
the state in recent times <#\>This value-added industry<,> will
be a great bonus to the Queensland sugar industry<,> that in
recent times as I said hasn't enjoyed very good times at all
<#\>I believe that this Bill prob'ly has more to do with primary
industries Mr Deputy Chairman<,> than it has with ah<,>
transport but however<,> 
<$B> <#\>It's got a lot to do with jobs
<$A> <#\>Well that's true too minister and<,> that's why the
Opposition ah<,> supports it<,> the way it will be supporting
it but ah<,,> <#\>Mr Deputy Speaker in ah<,,> in<,> supporting
the
Bill here today I will not be speaking any longer on it <#\>Two
of my colleagues will speak who are sugar people<,> and ah<,> 
have a great deal to do with the sugar industry<,> in their
relative regions<,> but ah<,> it does give me great pride<,>
to ah be able to say here this afternoon that we totally
endorse this Bill<,> and anything that is going to further
enhance the sugar industry<,> or any other industry in this
state Mr Deputy Chairman the Oppodi Opposition will totally
support it<,,>
<$C> <#\>The Honourable Member for<,,> Mundingburra<,,>
<$D> <#\>Um<,> Mr Deputy Speaker<,> <{1><[1>I'll be brief</[1> I'll be
brief
as well in supporting the Harbours Amendment Bill um<,,> <#\>The
Minister for Transport has ah indicated that the establishment
of an eighteen million dollar forty five thousand tonne
refined sugar storage and shipping facility at Mackay
Harbour<,> forms only part of an estimated seventy six million
dollars<,> to be spent in the local area on this project<,,>
which includes the construction of a sugar refinery<,> annexed
to race course mill <#\>A further twenty two million dollars<,>
as the member for Gregory just mentioned<,> is to be spent on
bulk sugar refined<,> I'm sorry on bulk refined sugar re
receivable facilities at Sydney and<,> New Zealand <#\>The
project
is based on utilisation of a special purpose<,> one hundred
and seventy five metre bulk carrier CHL Innovator<,> which
incorporates efficient bulk<,,> bulk-in bulk-out technology
for handling refined sugar in a bulk form<,> allowing bulk-in
loading<,,> and bulk or bagged unloading via six onboard
bagging machines <#\>Such a large injection of funds into the
into a local community<,> and the state is always important<,>
but in these tough times it takes on an even greater
significance<,> <#\>It's a vote of confidence<,> in the sugar
industry<,> and in the Mackay region<,> which produces<,>
about thirty percent of Queensland's raw sugar exports<,>
through the Port of Mackay<,> <#\>With this private consortium<,>
putting up all the money<,> for the project<,> that is<,>
there's no government funds at all<,,> and working
constructively with government to overcome obstacles<,> it
provides a timely incentive in these times<,> for other
companies to seek out opportunities for valuating<,> of
commodities not only in the sugar industry<,> but oth other
industries as well<,> <#\>I believe that  this is just another
example of the government's cooperative attitude ah with
business to get major projects up and running<,> as soon as
possible<,> and generate wealth<,> and jobs for citizens<,> of
this state <{2><[2>and as the</[2> and as the minister mentioned a while
ago<,> ah it will also create employment <#\>This amendment to
the Harbours Act is a poshi positive initiative<,> and I um<,>
commend the Bill to the house<,> and I'd like to ah<,>
congratulate the minister<,> and the staff of the Harbour<,>
Harbour Authorities throughout Queensland for the fine
progressive examples and the jobs that they're putting on the
boards over recent time <O>Muttering</O>
<$?> <#\><[1>Hear hear</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Hear hear</[2></{2> 
<$C> <#\>Order<,,> <#\>I call the Honourable Member for Mirani
<$E> <#\>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker and I rise today with
pleasure to speak on this ah Harbour Amendment Bill<,> <#\>And
I
must say at the outset that I'm in complete agreement and I
give total support<,> <{><[>to the Mackay Sugar<,,></[> total
support to the Mackay Sugar Co-operative's initiative<,> in
taking the steps to build these facilities not only at the
harbour but race course mill <#\>And certainly Mr Acting
Speaker<,> not Acting Deputy Speaker<,> I am ah<,> greatly
concerned about the<,> unemployment<,> figures in Mackay
district and when you think about forty percent of our kids up
there can't get jobs<,> we must  totally support these sort of
initiatives and I congratulate Mackay Sugar Co-operative for
what they're doing
<$?> <#\><[><O>general approval</O></[></{> 
<$B> <#\>And the government
<$E> <#\>But Mr
<$B> <#\>And the government<,,>
<$E> <#\>Well<,> I don't know about the government <#\>How much
money
have you put in<,,> <#\>You haven't put too much in yet<,,>
<#\>However I congratulate you on the unemployment that's up
there<,> ah no but I if you if you've got a part in it I'll
congratulate you<,> <#\>But I hope you listen to what I'm going
to
say <#\>It's a totally new concept for the sugar industry<,> not
only er in Mackay but<,> possibly right<,> throughout
Queensland except for<,> I understand a small refinery in
Bundaberg<,> <#\>But<,> Mr Acting Mr Deputy Speaker<,,> there are
just a few and prob'ly I wouldn't call them concerns but I
just have ah like to say that I'd express the hope<,> that
other companies going into the business don't start
undercutting each other in a price war<,> in a trade war<,,>
and if this happens nobody'll be the winner<,> except prob'ly
the consumer but they'll certainly<,,> be to the detriment of
the growers and millers in ah<,> in this in this state<,> <#\>And
certainly if that happened I don't anticipate it will it'll
prob'ly be to the detriment of cane growers<,,> particularly
in my area <#\>However as I said I commend<,,> Mackay Sugar in
the knowledge that they've done their homework<,> and I
certainly hope they have done they're homework<,> and
certainly their financial homework<,,> and can enter into this
new phase in the industry with complete confidence<,> in the
huge amount of finance that has been invested<,,> <#\>I
understand they<,> and I know that they intend to also ah<,>
build storage facilities at Sydney and Auckland in New
Zealand<,> and it does concern me<,> in New South Wales
particularly several countries including Manila and CSR<,>
will be striving for a greater share of the market in New
South Wales<,> <#\>And I just hope<,> that those markets will not
be depleted because of any<,> price cutting<,> measures <#\>And
I
prob'ly shouldn't say depleted but ah<,,> <{><[>lessened in value</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>Oh say it</[> </{>Say it
<$E> <#\>I understand on the world scene<,> it's a wonder you<,>
Mr Beattie on Brisbane Central you haven't got something to
say about sugar because it'd be about the only thing I haven't
heard from you<,> <#\>As long as you get up and give us a little
bit of support I'll ah <{><[>I'll tolerate you</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>Well we agree with you</[></{> We agree with you
<$E> <#\>Well I'm I'm totally<,> I'm really pleased that he does
agree with me<,,> <#\>But Mr ah Deputy Speaker I understand on
a<,> world scene
<$G> <#\><O>inaudible</O> Mr Peter Beattie agree with you
<O>Laughter</O> 
<$E> <#\>No <#\>I will say that Peter Beattie is the one member
on
the other side of the House who's got the capacity to
understand the<,> hardships of the rural producers<,> <{><[>and I just would hope<,> that at some stage of the game he is promoted<,,> promoted up to that front bench over there<,> and give us a much needed boost<,> in the confidence that we do <#\>It's it's just alarming to see what we've got<,,> sorry Mr Deputy Speaker <#\>They're provoking me</[> <#\>I understand Mr<,,>
Deputy Speaker that on the world scene apart from the
refineries we have in many countries at the present times<,>
there are<,> a couple of new refineries planned already <#\>One
at Tokyo for a hundred thousand tonne capacity<,,> of
production <#\>Ah Dubai in the Middle East for four hundred tonne
capacity<,,> and even if these facilities are only for their
own home consumption<,> it will certainly take a slice out of
the world market<,> in which we're hoping to get a share<,> so
there are the refineries getting built all over the world<,,>
<#\>But I'll also say that<,> it is very good thing that<,>
there's no doubt<,> in my mind and the mind of many experts
demand for sugar will increase as the standard of living in
the third world country rises<,> and you find that when the
ah<,> standard of living rises people suddenly<,> buy
chocolates and a lot of sweet things and and there's<,>
<O>inaudible</O> the sugar demand will get greater <#\>So prob'ly
the spoils'll be available to those countries who get in on
the ground floor of any marketing area and Mackay Sugar Co-
operative's done this <#\>They've got in on the ground floor
<#\>They're at a stage where they can get in very quickly if
anything develops and I congratulate them for that<,>
<$?> <#\><[><O>general grumbling</O></[></{> 
<$?> <#\>Thank you
<$E> <#\>One other thing I'd like to remark very briefly on in
particular<,> the race course mill area where Mackay Sugar Co-
operative intend to refine their sugar<,> <#\>It is essential<,>
that the point of delivery for raw sugar<,> at which the Sugar
Co-operative acquires the sugar must remain<,,> and what I'm
saying<,> for members<,> to ah enlighten them is that<,> the
raw sugar will go ah go ah<,> into Mac race course mill<,>
race course mill has to acquire that sugar from the
Corporation less transport costs and vary various other things
they get at a cheaper rate<,> <#\>But it's at that point<,> where 
the raw sugar is developed that the Sugar Corporation must
take control in acquisition<,,> and assurances must be given
that this move for refined sugar will not impact<,> in no way
impact<,,> on the acquisition and single desk selling<,> by
the Sugar Corporation<,> <#\>And if anything like that happens
I'll certainly be ah<,> going against it<,> <#\>Finally I'd like
to say that I understand some discussion's already started on
the ownership of the land on which the raw sugar bulk storage
sheds are presently situated at Mackay Harbour<,> and such
land is<,> is owned<,> ah ah presently by the Harbour
Corporation<,,> and at some stage<,> this land w has to be re
acquired<,> or will be acquired and handed over to the Cor
Sugar Corporation on behalf of the industry<,,> <#\>And there's
no
doubt Mr ah Deputy Speaker that it'll be a complex matter
to<,> work out who does own that because the finance to build
these facilities and they're owned by the by the industry<,>
the finance was arranged by the industry and the Cane Growers
and Millers<,> so how are we going to<,,> get when they put it
back to the industry<,> are they gonna give shares to the cane
growers <#\>Are they going to give shares to the individual
farmers<,> <#\>And some way or other<,> where they've put the
money in it's gotta come back so they've got some holding
there <#\>But irrespective<,> I believe at some stage that land
should be put in a position where it is owned and controlled
by the indus industry through the Sugar Corporation <#\>Mr<,,>
Deputy Speaker I totally support this Bill<,> and wish Mackay
Sugar<,> and the Minister<,,> and I I<,> wish them all the
best in their endeavours to break into the refined sugar
market in the world<,> because<,> we certainly need it in er
with our<,> employment re record up there</I>
