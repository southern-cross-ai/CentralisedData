<I><$A>  <#\>And firstly to you Steve, could you just outline
what role your council plays in the organisation of school
sport
<$D>  <#\>The Australian Schools Sports Council is the
umbrella body for school sport in Australia <#\>And ah we have as
our members the state's sports associations, ah whose role it
is to organise and administer sporting activities for
children, at both primary school and secondary school level ah
in all Australian states and territories <#\>Ah the activities
are usually organised at various levels of competition ah
culminating in an inter-state program for both primary school
and secondary school students <#\>Ah each year we run some
twenty-nine inter-state activities
<$A>  <#\>Do you actually have input into the sports
curriculum at an individual school level
<$D>  <#\>Ah, no we don't <#\>Ah our member associations in the
states and territories have a more direct input into that
area <#\>Ah at the same time however, ah most of the ah
curriculum side of things is usually handled within each
education department from their curriculum branches 
<$A>  <#\>Now how would you compare the way sport is played in
the co in the community with the way it's ah taught and s
played at school
<$D>  <#\>Sport in schools, organised by school teachers, ah
is the way that we can access the greatest number of students
to participate in sporting activities <#\>I think that in many
aspects some community sports are making it more and more
difficult for students to participate <#\>Ah there are large
costs involved in many instances and I believe that ah the way
that sport is sometimes delivered to students, in other words
the the way that competitions and activities are organised,
tend to make it very difficult for people to get involved <#\>Ah
by way of example I I believe that um students today ahh are
very different to the way that students used to be ah many
years ago whereby ah long-term commitments to sporting
competitions are much more difficult to get from students <#\>So
rather than organising a competition for example i in say
soccer or football ah that runs for three to four months, then
ah I I feel that it would encourage more students to
participate if there if it were a shorter competition, made
more interesting, ah en encompassing ah teams from various
areas to participate, and I also think that um the one
advantage that school sport has over community sport ah in the
cost area is that it is much cheaper for students to
participate in sport at school <#\>Ah usually the equipment is
provided by the school, the the coaching is free, and there
are few very few costs other than the occasional bus fare to
get from venue to venue, whereas ah in many community sporting
activities, ah for children to participate there is usually
some form of registration fee, ah the participants usually
have to buy their own equipment in many cases a and ah things
like that
<$A>  <#\>Mm hm <#\>Well, would I ask Henny Oldenhove from the
Australian Sports Commission to to come in here <#\>Ah Henny are
you happy with the level of participation at school, ah in
sporting activities, and ah would you like to see an extension
of the kinds of er sporting activities that are offered
<$C>  <#\>Yes I think ah it's very important that schools,
like in other curriculum areas, have a responsibility to
provide a sporting and indeed a physical education option for
all their students <#\>Um I'd certainly agree with Steve that er
the role of the Australian School Sports Council does an
excellent job at providing an elements of school sports at the
delivery end, which in general tends to um bring in if you
like, the the more confident players, but I think that should
never be at the expense of the opportunity of all young people
to have access to a school sport program <#\>So in a sense I
think it's very important that ah schools provide,if you like,
a a sport for all ethos, um which recognises the need for for
young people to be able to pursue sport at their elite end <#\>I
think that's very important, but certainly never at the
expense of all children being able to have access to such a
program 
<$A>  <#\>Well one way to create that sports for all ethos, I
think the Australian Sports Commission has ah pioneered, is
the development of Aussie Sports in ah primary school <#\>Now,
can you give me an outline of what Aussie Sports is all about,
and the thinking behind it
<$C>  <#\>Aussie Aussie Sports has gone through a bit of a
transition in the last two years in the sense that um whilst
the program originated for young people at primary school, the
Commission's now taken, if you like, the philosophy of Aussie
Sports um to a much broader degree to encompass the thirteen
to eighteen year-old age group <#\>So Aussie Sport for us at the
Commission means a lot more about the philosophy of
participation for all, the idea of fair go, the idea that er
all young people can have an access to sport education and
sporting opportunities <#\>Now, in the primary school of course,
that um particular Aussie Sport program has meant, in a sense,
giving children the chance to play an appropriate sport, which
for young children means such access to modified games <#\>So
that instead of young young children playing the full adult
game on full field with a full size ball, which is like ants
to the honey pot, um it's very much a case of saying <quote> Well why
don't we break down the games so that er the size of the
field, the size of the ball and the opportunity for kids to to
participate and develop their skills is much more suited to
their age group</quote> <#\>Now of course that's true for probably seven
to ten year olds <#\>Um, I think it's also true to say that as
young people become older, sor thirteen, fourteen, fifteen
year-olds, it may not be appropriate to play modified sport,
but it's very important to have, the s, if you like, the cun
conduct of sorry, the conduct of sport in such a way that all
kids get access <#\>Um, one of the things that we found from our
market research with young people and sport is that they all
want to be able to have a go <#\>So, instead of being sat on the
bench for the whole season, they want to make sure that their
coaches and teachers give them an opportunity to get out there
on on the field and ah and the court and have a go <#\>And that's
very important to young people
<$A>  <#\>Mmm <#\>So in ah promoting though modified versions of
of adult games, I guess that that helps to reduce injuries as
well
<$C>  <#\>It's certainly designed to ah cater more for for
little kids if you like ah the fact that the bat's not that
big that they can actually swing it without maybe falling over
it, or that the the ball is so large that they don't have the
chance to catch it <#\>Um, if we bring the size of the field and
the equipment relative to the the growth of the the child,
then I think it's it's fairly true to say that we are
minimising the risk of injury, and by modifying the rules in
in particular in the contact sports such as ah rugby league,
rugby union, Australian rules football and so on, they take
out if you like the the tackle rules and so on, so the kids
actually get a chance to develop their skills by playing the
ball <#\>So I think that's the sort of modification that reduces
that risk of injury as well
<$A>  <#\>Are you in favour of that approach though for the
adolescent years, because in recent times there there's been
quite a few horrific instances where boys have become
paraplegics or quadraplegics as a result of playing school
football
<$C>  <#\>I guess in a sense i that begs the question about
suitability of some young people for the sports that they
choose <#\>Um, I guess one of the big arguments that's been used
for a long time and probably Matt can answer that better than
I can about long necked people playing rugby, whether they
should be playing <#\>Now I guess the question is should they be
playing rugby, or should the rules of rugby change in order to
cater for those people <#\>And I think that's a very vexed
question that ah is probably, needs to be addressed by the
National Sports itself
<$A>  <#\>Well could I ask Matt Reid er from the Sports
Medicine Federation to come in here <#\>Um, are you in favour of
modifying adult games to reduce sports injuries
<$B>   <#\>I am not absolutely certain of the reduction of the
injuries at a rate, where in the seven to ten year-old
brackets, certainly it will occur in the older age groups <#\>Um,
our studies or the studies that have been done on sports
injuries have shown that the injuries do increase alarmingly
from sixteen years onwards <#\>Ah, so they're the sports that w
or they're the age groups we have to look at more closely I
think
<$A>  <#\>So it's at the top end of the secondary school that
the the main problem occurs
<$B>   <#\>Certainly is
<$A>  <#\>Mm hmm <#\>Well, what are some of the more common
sports injuries though, across the age ranges, that ah a as a
sports medicine person you're likely to see
<$B>   <#\>The more common injuries that we do see are not the
traumatic injuries <#\>They're more the chronic or over-use
injuries where children have been participating in too much
sport rather than not enough <#\>It usually occurs in ah the more
elite type of child athlete who's playing in several different
competitions <#\>He may play for the school rugby union team as
well as playing on the weekend with the club rugby union team
and that does cause problems <#\>Um, one thing to be wary of is
that we are also fairly positive in pushing accreditation of
people <#\>Um, quite often at school sport we do get the problem
where um people are thrown into a position of being a coach
because they're one of the school teachers rather than an
appropriately qualified person 
<$A>  <#\>Steve Kayland, could I ask you to comment here
because I understand the Sports Council is particularly
concerned to upgrade the standard of coaching in schools
<$D>  <#\>Yes, ah we feel that ah one of the key areas for the
future, to ensure that ah not only that we have fewer
injuries, but to ensure that the tuition that is given to
children playing sport is ah of a suitable standard, is to
upgrade the quality of coaching <#\>Now that's not a very simple
thing to achieve because what we're looking at there is
teachers receiving adequate sports coaching training prior to
commencing their teaching careers, so that when they do take
on the responsibilities of coaching sport in school, they have
the necessary expertise to ah ensure that ah the information
that they're imparting on students is relevant and is
satisfactory <#\>But ah in relation to to sporting injuries, I do
believe that now more than ever before, there is ah in the
school system at least ah ah the a greater awareness of the
fact that um ah there have been certain instances in the past
that um have made ah you know public headlines with regard to
sports injuries and I think ah teachers not only ah make sure
that ah they can try and avoid these circumstances, but at the
same time I think there has been a somewhat negative effect in
that it has discouraged teachers from getting themselves
involved in sports coaching, because of the fear that ah one
of their charges may perhaps be be injured ah in in a ga in a
sporting competition
<$A>  <#\>Mmm</I>
