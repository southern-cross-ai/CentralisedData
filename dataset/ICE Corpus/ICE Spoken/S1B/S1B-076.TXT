<$B> <#\>Uh the previous balance was five hundred and ninety five
dollars <#\>The interest to the thirty first of December three
dollars twenty-eight <#\>And less a donation to the Telopea
Public School for the use of the library in nineteen ninety-four
a hundred and fifty dollars leaving a balance at the present day
four hundred and forty-eight dollars twenty-eight cents <#\>And
the o <#\>There has been a slight change in the St George
conditions <#\>They've introduce two new accounts which they're
encouraging people to switch to <#\>But we can stay on the
present account provided we keep a balance of a minimum of two
hundred and fifty dollars
<$Z> <X><#\>That's the Freedom account</X>
<$B> <#\>If we fall below that it costs us two dollars a
month <#\>So we're retaining the present account
<$A> <#\>Thank you <#\>Someone like to move the report be
received
<$Z> <X><#\>This is <O>4 syll</O></X>
<$A> <#\><O>1 syll</O> thankyou <#\>Seconded <#\>Any questions
for the treasurer
<$Z> <X><#\>Well organised</X>
<$A> <#\>Beg your pardon
<$Z> <X><#\>Well organised</X>
<$A> <O>laughs</O>
<$Z> <X><#\>Yes</X>
<$A> <#\>Okay all those in favour of receiving that report
<O>several non-corpus speakers say 'aye'</O> <#\>Aye <#\>Thank
you <#\>And the next item unfortunately is my report <#\>Um and
it it's great to be able to report on what happened last year
because we've seen some major changes into our operations
<#\>Um we've held six I think successful meetings during the year
<#\>And were fortunate to have guest speakers at five of those
six meetings <#\>Um the summary of the meeting we had in February
<#\>We had our annual meeting which was addressed by Mr David
Bourke from the N R M A <#\>In April we had a good meeting but
unfortunately the Accident Investigation Squad didn't get here
so uh but um <#\>So we didn't have a speaker <#\>But we had a had
a good night anyhow <#\>In June Inspector Bob Poole who's the
Patrol Commander from Ermington spoke to us <#\>In August we had
Constable Greg Donaldson from the Special Operations Branch
<#\>Um and October I think we had a extremely interesting night which was um with Detective Mick
Parker and Paul Grek from Ermington <#\>And remember they
brought along their samples or imitations of drugs and things
like this <#\>And uh I think we could have gone all night with
them <#\>And then on in December we had Inspector Bob Poole back
again talking to us <#\>So that um they were our six meetings for
the year <#\>In addition the newsletter has been distributed to
all homes in the area before each meeting <#\>Uh this newsletter
I believe is a most important part of the work of Neighbourhood
Watch as it alerts people to the problems of our area <#\>And
it's interesting the distribution of that now totals two thousand
three hundred copies every two months <#\>So there's a lot of
delivering going on <#\>Um the encompassing of part of the
previously inactive area nine into E R eight was a most important
development during the year <#\>Not only did this mean that
residents from the new area now have accessibility
Neighbour<,>hood watch activities but their atten tendance and
interest in our activities has strengthened our group
considerably <#\>And I I'm unfortunately there's not too many of
them here tonight
<$Z> <X><#\>I think they're scared of being elected did you
say</X> <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>There has been a most gratifying response from
residents in the new area willing to act as coordinators <#\>We
have continued to be represented on the community consultative
committee which meets regularly under the auspices of the police
<#\>Here representatives from other Neighbourhood Watch areas
attend together with local councillors and police to discuss
community problems and possible solutions <#\>I would like to
thank the members of the police force for their continued support
during this year <#\>We have had at least one representative at
all meetings this year <#\>A great improvement on the situation
not long ago when it was becoming a rarity um for a police
representative to be present <#\>Um I was wondering if you could
please pass on to our appreciation to Bob Poole um and also your
offsiders who are involved in Neighbourhood Watch that it is
appreciated that that they've been coming <#\>Thanks <#\>We again
conducted a stall prior to Mother's Day <#\>And in our new
location outside Bi-Lo it was even more profitable than
previously <#\>The availability of the Neighbourhood Watch
caravan manned by Neighbourhood Watch members and Constable
Stephanie Harris also contributed to making the morning most
successful <#\>At our December meeting we were able to make a
financial contribution to the Telopea Public School who kindly
make their premises available to us for our meetings <#\>We
acknowledge and appreciate the splendid cooperation we receive
from the school principal Mr Colin Booth <#\>And such a
successful year would not be possible without the help of a
number of people <#\>Uh to Jean Tyler our extremely hard-working
secretary who does so much behind the scenes work in addition to
the secretarial work of the C we owe a great deal
<#\>Thanks a lot Jean <#\>Now <O>applause</O> <#\>To the
coordinators who regularly ensure that the newsletter is de
delivered to to all households <#\>Thank you too <#\>And to
others who have helped in a variety of ways <#\>And those of you
who attend regularly I thank you <#\>For without your continued
interest um this Neighbourhood Watch could not function thankyou
<O>applause</O> Somebody like to move that report be received
<#\>Thank you <#\>Seconded

<$A> <#\>The um <#\>The next positions we've got are um I should

did't get round to it <#\>Um the way we've got our area divided
up now with the new area
<$Z> <X><#\><O>3 syll</O></X>
<$?> <#\>We've
<$?> <#\>Yeah <#\>Yeah it's a bit hard to see <#\>Well
<$Z> <X><#\>There's one</X>
<$A> <#\>That'll give you an idea <#\>Ther There you can see the
old area which is divided into ten different areas <#\>Now
basically we've we've got divided that again into two areas and
we've appointed we've appointed one person to look after those
<O>2 syll</O> areas and and another person to look down after
five there and basically it's just distributing um
newsletters out to five coordinators <#\>So that the five
coordinators can get them into letterboxes <#\>Um and we were
hoping if possible to get another one of those <&>break in
recording</&> <O>1 syll</O> for the new <&>break in recording</&>
over this side of the railway line so that when the newsletters
are printed and the person who's got two thousand three hundred
letters knows that they've gotta distribute say eight hundred to
one person who will then get rid of them to five people and say
seven hundred to somebody else who'll get rid of them to five
people and another eight hundred to another person who will get
rid of them to five or six people <#\>So we're looking for three
people to do that <#\>The people who have been doing it um</I>
