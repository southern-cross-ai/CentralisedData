<I><$A> <#\>Look at the health of Christopher Skase <#\>Is it so bad 
<#\>He cannot even get on a plane to come home to defend himself,
to answer charges <#\>Now I do not and cannot know whether
Skase's bout of European flu was genuine or long lasting
several years ago <#\>But likewise I cannot confirm or deny his
claims of a back injury restricting his travel movements 
<#\>Although after the workers comp claims in this country
recently over the so called Mediterranean back you'd think
Majorca was the last place to claim you had it <#\>He now says
he cannot travel by plane because of emphysema, a disease that
usually does not hit somebody so young even though Skase had
lung problems as an asthmatic child <#\>In recent years he's
been an enthusiastic night time cigar smoker <#\>I watched him
closely over five days and nights <#\>I do believe Christopher
Skase has emphysema <#\>So does my producer, Dermit O'Brien,
who's had life long lung problems as an asthmatic <#\>Whether it
is life threatening in the short term I don't and cannot know
<#\>There's one time you couldn't come home because you had
European flu right
<$B> <#\>No <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> <#\>No, I I was delayed <#\>I was
delayed by
about a week<[>right</[></{> but returned
<$A> <#\>Another time was a bad back <,,> there was still another
delay, pushing back a delayed, that that that but Isubsequently came for that matter in question <#\>Another time
was a fall down the stairs <#\>No, no, same same injury
same, same injury same, same injury okay <#\>And on the fourth time,
here's the major one before I get to it in some detail, is is
your current health problems over emphysema
<$B> <#\>Correct, right
<$A> <#\>Now, <,,> it must hurt you <,> that I'm going to put
this
to air in Australia, and say Christopher Skase is ill on
Majorca with emphysema <#\>And they will say bull shit
<$B> <#\>Well, who's who's they <#\>People, some people
watching,
some people who'll follow the saga, and so on 
<$A> <#\>How do you convince, or do you not need to convince
Australians, that Christopher Skase is too ill to travel
<$B> <#\>Well, I think the the the response to the latter point
is
that ah it is very very difficult to pee into a hurricane 
<#\>And when the press have been ah used ah and orchestrated by
special interests, including the A F C and the D P P ah to
create ah ah a veneer, to create a particular scenario, then
it is very hard to turn on the truth <#\>And you do reach a
point where you say, look the facts are the facts those who
know know, whether they want to admit it or not um <#\>And <,>
you just can't afford to lose sleep trying to beat the drum
and at the end of the day in certain instincts not terribly
important <#\>The facts are the facts
<$A> <#\>How life threatening is it
<$B> <#\>Well, <,,> I'm still learning about the disease um 
<#\>Unfortunately, lung diseases are an area where compared with
many other parts of the body there's been relatively little
progress as I'm informed in recent years um  <#\>It is present
in both lungs um <#\>I'm being treated by various doctors in
Spain and in Switzerland <#\>Among the best in the world <#\>I've
been told um to radically change my life style, to to quit
smoking cigars which obviously I've done <#\>I have a regular
regime daily of um medication and exercise and I've been told
very bluntly that on a worst case, I will need a double lung
transplant in the near term <#\>Now the problem with that is
that the record, globally, for survival post such an operation
is very very poor <#\>Maybe months, maybe one or two years <#\>So
<,> my medical team have a single objective with me, and my
family, and that is to ah elevate my status of health as much
as we can so that if that becomes a reality, and it looks as
though it's inevitable, that we can defer it from months to
years <#\>Because the technology particularly in the United
States is improving to a point where I'm told that within a
few years it should be ah an operation where you can then
survive for many years
<$A> <#\>What do you say to anybody, would it be me asking a
question as a journalist or to anybody back in Australia, the
common line was given to me on the plane even coming out here 
<#\>Ah, he's got to have some stashed away somewhere <#\>He's
gotta,
with that sort of empire he's gotta have, name a figure, five
ten twenty fifty million dollars stashed away somewhere
<$B> <#\>Now I've got plenty stashed away, and it's all still
inside Quintex <#\>And that, again, to those who know within the
banks and within the accounting professions who have been
involved, that is the blinding fact
<$A> <#\>The most damning thing probably against you in the early
stages when Quintex went into receivership, were the headlines
of management fees <#\>Forty two million sticks in everybody's
mind for the final year <#\>Now what do you say to that <#\>Where
did it go
<$B> <#\>Well, again, it's er been thoroughly recorded that a
large proportion of that went to third party supplies totally
totally unrelated to me or my family or to executives <#\>To to
airlines, to hotels, and it's all been audited and recorded 
<#\>And that's why the allegations have now been diluted down to
this um continuing basis
<$A> <#\>Because it was a, to the layman, who doesn't understand
the practice of management fees going in such large amounts,
they think, and they are perhaps entitled to think, that every
dollar of that management fee goes to you or goes to <,> so
many senior executives who've had ah who were involved in the
same um in that same separate company
<$B> <#\>Yep, I can understand the misconception <#\>A because
the
myth has been perpetuated <#\>As a group with ah three billion
dollars in assets, and a billion dollars in revenues, it was
recommended by professional people <#\>Not me, not other
executives but by major firms of chartered accountants and
lawyers to set up for the entire group a central management
company organisation, and that that's what was set up <#\>And
that company paid the rent to the AMP <#\>That company paid the
airline bills to Ansett and to Qantas <#\>That company paid
those sorts of bills <,> globally
<$A> <#\>In the last year of Quintex you were involved,
ironically
it is not only said that they signed a new ten year contract
with you as Chief Executive <#\>In the last year in eighty nine,
what sort of ways would you have taken out a credit
<O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>That is about fifty thousand dollars
<$A> <#\><,,> That's all
<$B> <#\>That order
<$A> <#\>But that the Chief Executive obviously the rest of the
perks and the nicest way would be from the executive jet and
the boat and the um
<$B> <#\>Yeah, I think I think again what what has not been ah
properly aired over the over the period is that throughout the
time my whole philosophy with Quintex was that I was not on a
fast buck, or a quick turn <,> <#\>And in fact in the whole
fifteen years I did not ever take holiday pay <#\>I didn't take
after ten years long service leave <#\>In retrospect I
should've <#\>I didn't benefit from any superannuation schemes 
<#\>Every dollar that came out of Quintex to me or to any of my
family companies not only went back but when back three times
four times five times <#\>The thing that ah distinguishes the
group was that directly and indirectly we created over twenty
five thousand jobs <#\>The the television network that was built
out of uh three disparate ownership situations, the television
production, the sporting events, the new projects, the hotels,
the golf courses, the marinas, the shopping centres - they're
all still there <#\>And they're all real and substantial
businesses and now part of the fabric of of Australian life
<#\>And we're proud of that <#\>In the case of Quintex it wasn't
ah
a crumble but it was ah the detonation of an atom bomb
<$A> <#\>What were the biggest mistakes - in your own head
<$B> <#\>There are there are different mistakes in different
areas <#\>I think that ah in a in a pure financial sense ah <,>
having our loan facilities basically totally denominated in
Australian dollars and being at the sort of risk which
ultimately occurred and the mercy of high interest rates 
when interest rates went up to ah north of twenty per cent
<$A> <#\>Couldn't you could you not foresee that and not try to
get some of your money <,> from overseas and you had a lot of
banks
<$B> <#\>Yeah, we had money sourced from overseas but the
majority
was denominated in Australian dollars <#\>Ah we had operated on
the basis you started here <#\>Yeah, we started in Australia
<#\>The Government ah had ah followed a policy of ah of
ah
supporting the currency, of ah maintaining interest rates at
a level ah that would enable the business community to
operate <#\>And that just all changed over night
<$A> <#\>Now you've said you had <O>inaudible</O> exposure to thirty
two banks <#\>Where you got into trouble, you managed to <,>
convince thirty one of them that they should be changes and a
turtle rate and you'd work your way through it <#\>Correct
<$A> <#\>Yes, we proposed a management restructuring plan that
simply recognised the change in financial circumstances and
the solution to deal with it  would that have left you in
there <#\>Yes, it would there there it would've have preserved
more importantly every one of the jobs <#\>It would have
preserved the integrity of the company and ah it was simply
meant some financial restructuring ah and it was it was
sufficiently credible in the end to be supported by thirty one
of the thirty two banks
<$A> The thirty second bank there's a story recently that
about um Rupert Murdoch came very close to line and finally
a little he had to call a little bank in Pennsylvania was
about to take him down <#\>Your bank though was a bigger one
than that, it was the Commonwealth Bank right <#\>Right, the
Commonwealth Bank <#\>What was your exposure to that
<$B> <#\>The exposure to the Commonwealth Bank was a hundred
million dollars

<$A> <#\>Any why did they pull the plug
<$B> <#\>The Commonwealth Bank pulled the plug because they ah
received interference from um several sources including um
Murdoch's organisation and from within ah the Government
<$A> <#\>But why would they do that <#\>I mean they knew <,> that
not the house of cards but the house would come down  that
they would wouldn't be able to sell the rooms off for the
price <,> if if it'd get going <#\>So why would they do that
<$B> <#\>Well the Commonwealth Bank is ah obviously directly
under the influence of Government, it's still majority owned
by the Government, and ah therefore they're able to be
subjected to direct influence of Government 
<$A><#\>But surely it's not in the Government's interest, a
Labor Government's
interest <,> to <,> burn down a house that had twenty five
thousand people in there, twenty five thousand jobs, at a time
when unemployment's creeping up towards a million 
<$B><#\>Yeah, its a bizarre er is the only ah comment er
to their behaviour
but that was what they did
<$A> <#\>Now there was a time though some earlier signals when
<,>
ah license fees for the Seven Network were not paid on time
because as I understand it the banks wouldn't release the
money until you'd sold done the deal to sell the forty nine
per cent of Mirage, correct
<$B> <#\>We, yes, we were in the process of that first
restructuring and ah that was the circumstance at the time 
<$A> <#\>So the cash flow was getting tight, then
<$B> <#\>The cash flow was starting to get tight for the reasons
that I enunciated earlier that interest rates were spiralling
daily, we had the airline strike ah biting and basically
turning the resorts off from any cash flow, and we had the
subsequent collapse of the contract to sell the regional
television stations <#\>Cause the last thing you you want to
have <,> at a time of a Federal airline strike is to own the
biggest investment <O>inaudible</O> in the country, isn't it</I>
