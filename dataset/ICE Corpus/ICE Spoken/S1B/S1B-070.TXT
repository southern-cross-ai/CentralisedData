a 
number of times that's correct
<$A> <#\>Well why have you approached former employees?
<$B> <#\>Well the former employees have um have I
saw one guy for example <@>fullname2</@> on the side 
of the road one day and I just pulled up talking to him and I had 
no idea at that stage that until he said <quote>I've been 
approached by I C A C</quote> about any of um 
 any of the ongoings of what I C A C have been doing
<$A> <#\><{><[>Okay and did you</[>
<$C> <#\><[>so so just</[></{>
your your 
meeting with Mr <@>surname2</@> was accidental was it ?
<$B> <#\>Well I just saw him sir on the side of the highway
driving a 
bulldozer <#\>Well I just pulled up hello to <@>firstname2</@> 
or Mr
<@>surname</@> and um just see how he was going that's all
<$A> <#\>When was that?
<$B> <#\>Oh I think um <,> <#\>oh I I 
think it 
was about the end of February early March I think from memory
<$A> <#\>What before the hearings commenced in
<@>placename1</@> ?
<$B> <#\>Yes I think so yeah <{1><[1><,></[1> from memory
<#\>I 
can't be a hundred percent sure exactly when Ms 
<{2><[2><@>surname3</@> </[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Alright</[1></{1>
<$C> <#\><[2>And what was</[2></{2> <#\>What conversation
did you 
have with Mr <@>surname2</@> insofar as it related to evidence
or 
possible evidence before the commission?
<$B> <#\>Think um <,,> sir I <,> from memory
I I was 
just talking to him and I said <quote>oh the um</quote> <,>
<#\>Oh 
sir I don't think I can recall but to be accurate to the best of 
my memory I I um was talking to 
<@>firstname2</@> and he said <quote>oh yes</quote> he said 
<quote> some um um I heard that that the I C A C have been there
there</quote> <#\>And he said <quote>well that's correct you're 
still there</quote> <#\>And he said <quote>I hear the hearing's 
going ahead</quote> and I said <quote>that's correct</quote> 
<#\>And ah I think that was about about it 
<#\>I think um he might have said <quote>oh I wonder if we'll get 
a visit from them or if we'll be spoken to</quote> something
along 
those lines <#\>There's nothing much I can remember
<$C> <#\>And have you spoken to Mr <@>surname2</@> since?
<$B> <#\>Oh just this morning sir <,> outside here
<$C> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Anyone else any other former employees that ah 
you've 
spoken to since ah the investigation commenced? <,,>
<$B> <#\>I can't recall of any others that I know of <#\>Um
I've 
spoken to a lot of former employees and a lot of employees um 
<#\>That's what we always do <#\>We keep fairly close with them
<$A> <#\>You keep fairly close with them? <#\><{><[>You 
keep</[> contact with former employees is that right?
<$B> <#\><[>Basically</[></{>
  <#\>Well quite often they come back and work with us
<#\>They 
leave for a short period of time and then come back <#\>We've had 
that happening a number of times
<$C> <#\>I think I think Ms
<@>surname3</@> 
has in mind have you have you had any 
conversations with employees or former employees relating to 
evidence that ah they might give or which might be given before 
this commission
<$B> <#\>Sir I've spoken to employees and former employees
um 
about what's happening <w>'cause</w> they were all very um well 
concerned or interested but I don't believe or know of any 
evidence or um anything I've ever done to affect the commission
<$A> <#\>Well for instance have you spoken to Mr
<@>fullname4</@> 
<,> since this investigation began
<$B> <#\>Oh I've spoken to <@>firstname4</@> a number of
times
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm and have you spoken to him about any evidence
that 
he might give to the commission?
<$B> <#\>Um no I don't think so <#\>If I recall I think we 
basically talk about what's happening <,> and um how he's going
with 
the machinery that he's working with up on the north coast
<$A> <#\>Did you approach Mr <@>surname4</@> or did he
approach 
you on this occasion that you spoke to him?
<$B> <#\><{><[>Um</[>
<$C> <#\><[>I</[></{> think Mr <@>surname1</@> said he'd
spoken 
to Mr <@>surname4</@> on a number of occasions
<$A> <#\>You've spoken to him on a number of occasions?
<$B> <#\>Oh yeah <#\>I've spoken to him quite regularly yes

particular 
no
<$A> <#\><{><[>Did you say</[>
<$C> <#\><[>When when</[></{> was that?
<$B> <#\>Oh sir I think it was early this year some time
from 
memory or some time <#\>I can't be a hundred percent sure
<$C> <#\>Well let's let's try Mr 
<@>surname1</@> 
<$B> <#\><{><[>Well</[>
<$C> <#\><[>I'll give you the point</[></{> Mr
<@>surname5</@> 
rang you up and talked to you about the ICAC inquiry is that 
right? <,>
<$B> <#\>Mr <@>surname5</@> rang up um just just I think to see how we were going in New Guinea 
<{><[>um</[> if we had any work <#\>He rang up to say I think 
he's um he's um looking for some looking for work at this stage and um I think he said 
<quote>oh I was talking to somebody from I C A C some of the 
investigators </quote> and I said <quote>oh is everything 
alright?</quote> or something along those lines <#\>I can't think 
<#\>And he said <quote>oh as far as I know</quote> <#\>So that
was 
about it sir

ICAC investigators?

before Friday?
<$B> <#\>Oh sir<,,> possibly a fortnight ago or something
<#\>I can't

didn't I 
didn't ask him any of those questions
<$C> <#\>You didn't ask him alright <#\>And in this
conversation 
at seven o'clock on Friday you you're quite 
sure you did not discuss the evidence that was being given on the 
Thursday about Mr <@>surname6</@> 's possible involvement in the
ah 
 dockets and invoicing?
<$B> <#\>No sir I um I didn't discuss
anything 
with him on what was going on <#\>We weren't don't know the laws or the rules so I wasn't taking
the 
risk there

of 
<@>placename3</@> ?

what we'd need to what machinery we required 
things like that
<$A> <#\>Didn't have any conversation that you can recall
about 
the I C A C hearing or investigation
