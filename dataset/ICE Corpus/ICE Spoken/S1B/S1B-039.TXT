<I><$A> <#\>Mr Catanzariti<,> you received a tongue lashing from
Laurie Brereton for advising business to<,> lay off<,>
unsatisfactory workers by March thirty <#\>Any<,> regrets about
that advice
<$B> <#\>No <#\>I mean I was only focussing on the unsatisfactory
<#\>I
think there was a lot of<,,> misreporting suggesting I was
saying<,> wider than that<,> but I was really concerned on
poor performance which is gonna be a very difficult issue to
deal with<,>
<$A>  <#\>Do you think anyone took your advice<,,>
<$B>  <#\>Well I's I's I haven't received any feedback as to
whether people followed that viewpoint or not<,,> but I do
know that as a positive<,> a lot of people introduced
performance appraisal systems<,> which they didn't have in
place
<$A>  <#\>Garry Brack<,,> did employers take any advice <#\>Do
you<,>
any sign of an upturn in terminations before March thirty
<$C>  <#\>No <#\>I doubt that ah<,> but on the other hand the
real
question is not<,> did they take that advice but are they
going to put people on in the future and I think<,,> the
reality is<,> that the shape of this legislation<,,> will
convince a lot of small businesses that it's not worth their
while<,> taking the risk on putting people off because of the
dif on because of the difficulties off putting them off<,> in
the future<,> and<,> that won't help us ah to create the sort
of jobs that we need
<$A>  <#\>Haven't many of those difficulties already existed
for<,>
many workers anyway
<$C>  <#\>No <#\>Not<,> not in the way that this legislation's
drafted
particularly in the area of ah<,> of dismissals<,> and ah<,>
there're a whole range of other where<,> the legislation
plainly is<,> crafted to benefit trade unions<,> ah and
crafted so that it's disadvantageous to employers
<$A>  <#\>Mr Sams could I put a<,> a case to you <#\>I'm I'm a
small
medium businessman<,> I've got a sales manager who's ah maybe
plugging away but<,> perhaps not quite<,> as good as the
company needs <#\>Maybe there's some one better who's
available<,,> <#\>Can I afford to sack him under this law<,>
<$D>  <#\>Well I think<,> what you need to take into account is
that ah this is designed to protect the employee <#\>It's
designed to ensure that we have minimum<,> protections for
them in termination situations<,,> and it can all be
tested<,,> and the fairness of the<,> oh and the justice of
that termination can be tested <#\>That's all the legislation
provides for and what could be more fairer than that
<$A>  <#\>Well testing's a very expensive business particularly
when all the onus of proof's on the employee <#\>If some one
who's marginal<,> in the position of this case <#\>A sales
manager who<,> perhaps isn't quite<,> as good as the company
needs <#\>Doesn't this mean<,> it's gonna be very hard to sack
him
<$D>  <#\>I don't believe so <#\>I don't believe so at all<,>
because
what it will provide<,> is an opportunity for management to
hone their skills in terms of recruitment<,> and I think
that's ah good for management <#\>I ah<,> don't think that they
should be complaining about this <#\>I think they should
recognise<,,> they have a responsibility<,> in if they wish to
terminate<,> an employee<,> to do so fairly and responsibly
<$C>  <#\>If you looked at the Victorian legislation when they
introduced<,> similar laws to this some years back<,,> they
ended up with about five thousand cases a year<,> including
everybody from<,,> the bottom to the top of ah of
organisations <#\>In those five thousand cases what they
effectively did was to convince employers that<,> if you
wanted to terminate somebody really what you had to do was pay
out five thousand bucks<,> to get rid of them <#\>No no question
of<,> the balance of justice <#\>No question of actually
introducing<,> wonderful new systems to determine whether you
had the right personnel in the first place<,> <#\>Just pay out
the money in order to avoid<,> the enormous loss<,> of
managerial time trying to fix problems<,> in businesses
<#\>That's really<,> what we're talking about and I think there's
some legitimate argument here about<,> fair treatment for
employees<,> but this legislation goes<,> overboard <#\>In fact
though it has a reversal of the onus<,> <#\>The employer under
this law<,> has to prove that he's done it fairly <#\>There're
a
whole series of prohibitions<,> that put him behind the eight
ball to start with <#\>In New South Wales the<,> obligations on
the employee to<,> prove<,> that it's unfair<,> which indeed
is quite the reverse <#\>Now<,> maybe there's some middle ground
there where<,> both sides are catered for<,,> but I think this
law clearly doesn't provide that sort of ah position for
employers
<$A>  <#\>Well at least the lawyers must be happy aren't they
<#\>More
business
<$B>  <#\>I don't think the lawyers view it that way <#\>I think
that
they view that<,> the system<,,> appears to be<,> going to be
fairly litigious and<,> in that sense<,> um<,> what and
because it opens up in the award free category<,> and I think
that<,,> while I can understand some of the concerns of the<,>
the non-a the award the covered award we've had that in
place<,> once we start getting senior managers clotting the
system<,,> they're gonna have to<,> they're gonna be<,,>
different considerations <#\>How do you say to a senior
manager<,> ah objectively<,,> that I've lost confidence in
you<,> <#\>We're gonna have to set down the criteria<,,> and
really have to come to grips with that properly
<$A>  <#\>So that's gonna have to be in writing <#\>Something
that you
have to prove it all the way through <#\><{><[>Something</[> that's just
a marginal<,,> may maybe not <O>inaudible</O> enough that case
I put up before<,> <#\>You're not gonna be able to afford to sack
him
<$B>  <#\><[>I I</[></{> 
     <#\>No <#\>Not unless you've actually documented everything
and
you've counselled him continuously<,> <#\>I mean<,> you've gotta
manage a business better <#\>I mean it's all about managing
people<,> and a lot of people are bad<,> people managers
<$A>  <#\>Well how did how<,> will that be got around <#\>Do you
expect ah<,> an explosions of casuals and ah specific
contracts<,,>
<$A>  <#\>Ah I'm not sure of the status of the<,> debate on
casuals
at the moment <#\>There is some suggestion that<,> casuals are
gonna be included in the legislation<,> <#\>If they are
included<,,> then<,> using a casual's not gonna help <#\>Fixed
term contracts<,,> again we have to sort out what the
regulations say in relation to that
<$A>  <#\>By the very nature of a casual though one would think
that means ah<,> not as much ah employment protection ah
<#\>Wouldn't that be right Mr Sams
<$D>  <#\>Well<,> I think a casual is entitled to the same
protection<,> and the same fairness<,> in a termination
situation <#\>I mean we have many situations where casuals<,> are
merely permanent<,> casuals and to that extent they might be
with an employer for many many years <#\>Why should the simple
status of being a casual<,> deny that employee from a fair
test<,,> in a reinstatement situation
<$A>  <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$C>  <#\><[>Is Mr Sams</[></{> is Mr Sams saying that<,> those people
who're short term temporary itinerant type casuals<,> are
going to be excluded from the legislation<,> as against those
who are<,> almost effectively permanent long term <#\>If you look
at the ILO Convention<,> it says<,> you can exclude a series
of people <#\>You've referred to some of them <#\>Fixed term
contracts <#\>Specified task contracts <#\>Probationers <,>
casuals<,> <#\>It seems to me that the<,> legislation here is
drafted for the benefit of unions<,> fundamentally<,,> and now
they're out for blood in order to<,,> you know get some of
these things back on their side <O>inaudible</O> including
casuals
<$D>  <#\>Well where we haven't seen the new the regulations as
they apply to casuals
<$A>  <#\>Well can I ask you what d'you here out of Canberra
<#\>Are
you gonna win or not<,>
<$D>  <#\>Well I think we should as I say we should treat
casuals<,> the same as any other form of employment <{><[><,> <#\>If they are</[> <,> unfairly treated<,> if they're unfairly treated
in termination they should have the opportunity to have that
tested<,> and to be treated properly <#\>Now<,,> if that means
that there is some problem about<,> the the nature of their
employment<,> then so be it <#\>I just think the fairness should
be there 
<$A>  <#\><[>Well what's <O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$C>  <#\>Is isn't there a simple question here <#\>The Federal
Government has relied on the ILO Conventions<,> said that
there's legitimacy is spreading the legislation<,> far
<{1><[1>beyond far far far beyond their original</[1> <,> constitutional
capacity <#\>Now they've<,> relied on these Conventions but yet
they are going to exclude<,> some of these things<,> <{2><[2>in another area</[2> 
<$D>  <#\><[1>But Gary you haven't seen you haven't seen the regulations</[1></{1> 
<$A>  <#\><[2>Well well well it seems</[2></{2> it seems that we don't know
yet<,> what's going to happen <#\>Do either of you hear anything
from Canberra <#\>Do either of you know<,> of casuals being
excluded or not
<$C>  <#\>We're we're told casuals are going to be included 
<#\>They're not going to be excluded 
<$A>  <#\>Do you hear the same thing Mr Sams<,,>
<$D>  <#\>We hear that<,,> <#\>We don't know what the form of the
regulations are<,,> and for Gary to be<,,> all excited about
this ah<,> this issue I think he should just wait and see 
<$A>  <#\>Will it actually help the Union Movement <#\>Would I
be
wrong in<,> interpretating this is<,,> this does this take
away some of the incentive to be a member of a union
<$B>  <#\>Well there will be individual access <#\>I mean<,,>
there
will you don't want you don't need<,> to be a member of a
union to get access to the system <#\>It'll open up the door for
everybody<,>
<$A>  <#\>So<,,> this actually could go against ah<,>
unionisation<,>
<$B>  <#\>Well ah it's I think the the union'll have to be
active<,,> to make sure that people just don't go<,,> on
frolics of their own <#\>They'll have they'll they'll
certainly<,,> they'll be recruiting people<,> to make sure
that that that the union is providing a service<,,>
<$A>  <#\>Mr Sams<,> ah if there's not need to ah be a member of
a
union to<,> keep your job<,> now that you can do it quite
cheaply ah<,> through the Industrial Relations side
<$D>  <#\>Well I think that there will always be a need for a
union
to<,> argue the case<,,> ah advise employees as to their
rights and entitlements and<,> I don't see that as nes
necessarily a problem <#\>Can I make the point about what Gary
said <#\>Look<,,> ah<,> the employers failed in their<,> in their
lobbying that's the<,> the simple reality of it <#\>They didn't
have a case<,,> and it's not a question of protecting the ACTU
or the Trade Union Movement <#\>It's about providing<,> for
employees<,,> decent standards<,> where they are terminated<,>
decent conditions in which their case can be tested<,> and for
years now<,> since the ah<,> since the Constitution was
framed<,> Federal award employees have had not that right<,>
<$A>  <#\>And people who aren't members of a union<,> people
who're
in management<,> don't they also need that right
<$D>  <#\>Well I don't care too much about them <#\>They can look
after themselves <#\>I'm concerned about those people that've
been denied the right<,> for<,> decades 
<$A>  <#\>We've gotta leave it there <#\>Thanks for talking to
us</I>


<S1B-039b> <165>
<I><$A>  <#\>So then the entire package and indeed<,> all
Government policies seem to be built on the assumption that
the world's gonna stay a friendly place for the rest of the
decade<,> that we're going to have uninterrupted<,> economic
growth <#\>What if we're wrong
<$B>  <#\>Well it's not built on that I don't think <#\>It's
built on the<,> belief that we've gotta become a more
competitive nation <#\>One of the ways of doing that is to
deal with the long term unemployed <#\>Another way of dealing
with it<,> is to pay attention to regional Australia but
importantly<,> from my point of view<,> to make sure that
we<,> act as a Government<,> to encourage industry to become
more competitive internationally
<$A>  <#\>But the figures the ah<,>  that the market's already having trouble
with<,> are based upon uner uninterrupted growth <#\>Er<,> what happens if the world doesn't turn up<,>
if the figures aren't quite there
<$B>  <#\>I think the ah the signs arethat the global economy is coming back</I>
