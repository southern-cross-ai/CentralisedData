<S1B-004> <2007>
<I><$A> <#\>I guess if you can understand what<,> the whole concept's
about<,,> the actual experimental study's not all that
difficult<,> <#\>Right<,> <#\>Let's go through it and see how we
go<,,> <#\>I'm not going to ask anybody for the author and
title <#\>That's sort of a bit easy<,,> <#\><@>firstname1</@> I
haven't heard from you for a while<,,> <#\>Does that sound a bit
ominous <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Yeah <#\>OK<,> well<,> this one<,> this<,> this
is an easy one<,> <#\>How about if you just um<,,> tell me
roughly<,> the purpose of the article<,> and then we'll get
people to<,> chip in and<,> give their<,,> comments and<,> any
questions<,,> <#\>Did you understand the article<,> <{2><[2>by and
large</[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Um<,> I understood<,></[2></{2> I didn't have trouble with the
study 'cos I thought that was really straight forward but I<,>
had a lot of trouble understanding the<,> anaphoric<,> the
concept of anaphoric relationships because I didn't<,> I
finished and I still didn't know what they were<,>
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>Even with the definitions that they provided<,> they
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Even at the</[></{> back
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> I still thought they were really difficult
<$A> <#\>OK well we might go through that<,,> not in too much
detail<,> because I don't think we have to worry too much<,>
but you must have a general idea of the anaphoric<,>
relationships and<,> what you really need to know is how the
study works so<,> that's OK <#\>We'll go through those and people
can <O>inaudible due to noise of people entering</O><,,>
<O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Sick daughter so I had to <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh right<,> <#\>See you tomorrow<,> OK<,,> <#\>Righto
<@>firstname1</@> <,> tell us what you think is the purpose of
the article
<$B> <#\>Um<,> basically I just think the purpose was ah<,> just
to examine<,> the effect of um<,> direct instruction<,> um<,>
in helping students to understand<,> anaphoric
relationships<,,> and <O>inaudible</O> providing this direct
instructions um<,> throughout the study<,>
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>That's how I<,> that's how I understood it
<$A> <#\>So in other words
<$B> <#\>By direct instruction provided by the teacher
<$A> <#\>What do you think<,> the study is aiming to show<,>
<$B> <#\>Um<,,> good question
<$A> <#\>What was the purpose of the study <#\>Well can somebody
help<,> <@>firstname1</@> <#\>We don't have to victimise her too
much
<$D> <#\>To show that it was an effective method of teaching
anaphoric relations<,> <#\><{><[>That direct instruction was <O>inaudible</O> against<,> other other types</[> of you know
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O> direct instruction<,,> against other methods</[> </{>
<$E> <#\>Against basic instruction and <O>people speaking at
once</O>
<$B> <#\>And wasn't it also to see if <O>inaudible</O><,,>
<$A> <#\>To see whether it would work <{><[><,></[> <#\>Right<,> <#\>Well I'm
not<,> do you think<,> to see whether it was worthwhile to<,>
they did do a sort of generalised<,> test on reading
comprehension I think <#\>Didn't they<,> <#\>At the end
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$?> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$D> <#\><[>I think they</[></{> more or less generalised <{><[><,> from the
fact that they <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Um<,> I think<,,> you see I I</[></{> think they assume we
need to know <#\>I don't know whether they actually<,> give any
sort of generalisation from anaphoric relationships to general
comprehension skills
<$F> <#\>I think though that that was one of his comments at the
end<,> about the limitations of the study
<$A> <#\>So we don't know <{><[><,></[> <#\>So really they're making an
assumption<,,> that anaphoric skills<,> should be necessary
<$F> <#\><[>Yeah</[> </{>
<$E> <#\>They actually state that on page eighty four <#\>Um<,>
<{><[>there's</[> little empirical support for its contribution to
comprehension but<,,> and then you look further on and they
say<,,> <quote> it<,> research into an educator's can<,> rely only on
intuition and past practice to enable them to instruct
students in anaphore</quote> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Yeah<,> I mean it makes sort of conceptual and intuitive
sense <{><[><,></[> that if you can<,> do this<,,> ah you can
understand and comprehend a little better <#\>Certainly you'd
think it'd have an effect on writing<,,> <#\>Ah<,> remind me<,>
to ah<,> take up an example from your essays that seems to
crop up over and over again<,> which is a very good example of
these anaphoric relationships and might mean something to
you<,> <#\>I I think the generalisation principle hasn't actually
been proved<,,> in this particular study
<$?> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$E> <#\>But they also make the comment that<,> it's difficult to
know whether when teaching comprehension<,,> isolating one
area<,> is effective or whether you have to teach
everything<,> <{><[>in together</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>That's right</[></{> <#\>And how are you also<,> able to prove
<{><[><,></[> you know<,> holding everything else constant <#\>It would
be very very difficult<,,> so um<,> they're doing what a lot
of process people<,> would would probably think<,,> was
totally inadequate<,> <#\>Taking a<,> certain area<,> a very
small area<,,> well it's not such a small area but it's
certainly a specific area<,> and just applying an<,> a model
of teaching to it<,,> <#\>When we look at that directly
structured model<,> um<,> going back<,> to some of the things
that we talked about the other day<,,> do you notice how they
say<,> that they're teaching students to gain responsibility
over their own teaching <#\>So they're actually saying that
within that direct instruction model<,> they're getting a sort
of a scaffolding<,,> um<,> sort of Vygotskian type of<,>
transfer of learning<,> which is quite interesting because
ah<,> I think we came we decided<,> that the two were not
mutually exclusive<,,> and they feel that they're actually
teaching that by letting<,,> simply I think by independent
practice<,> <#\>They're seen as a um<,,> ah<,> and teaching some
strategies<,> in<,> anaphoric relationships<,> <#\>OK well
that's<,> that's the purpose of it I think<,,> that it is
trying to test<,> a particular method of teaching<,> as
compared with another method<,> as compared with<,,> a control
group that hasn't been taught it at all<,> which is<,> always
a very good way<,,> to um<,,> do an experimental study 'cos if
you don't have the<,> control group it might just be the extra
time or the the the group that has something else<,> <#\>It might
just be extra time on the task<,> that is having the effect
rather than teaching methods
<$?> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$G> <#\>What <O>inaudible</O> when you're actually doing
something like this and<,> the kids are all<,> all know each
other and <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Well<,,> if you've got three different classes taught by
three different teachers<,> you're going to have a difference
in your structure and<,> techniques anyway aren't you
<O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\>Mmm <#\>But wasn't this one<,,> well put together though
<$A> <#\>Um<,,> they they took<,,> yes<,> <#\>No <#\>They took them
out<,> well it's<,> I s'pose it's like taking the kids out
into reading groups <{><[><,></[> <#\>This is where your group one who
are elephants and these are the<,> continents and these are<,>
the jurrassic parks or something <O>laughter</O> so um<,> 
<$F> <#\>The other thing they did<,> they<,,> they took the
children out<,> <O>inaudible</O> they did their pretest<,>
<#\>They actually then split split<,> the brighter children across
the three groups<,> and the middle and the lower so<,,> it
obviously wasn't<,,> am randomly <#\>Obviously it wasn't a
<$A> <#\>No<,> <#\>It wasn't a ran<,> <#\>It it was actually a
matched<,> triad<,> assignation I guess you can say<,> <#\>They
wanted to make quite sure<,> because randomisation of a
small<,> um numbers doesn't necessarily ensure that you're
going to get<,> equal spread<,> so they were a little bit more
careful<,,> to make sure that you got<,> a third goodies a
third average 
<$?> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>So in a way it isn't like a reading group at all <#\>It's
more like a um<,> a parrallel class
<$H> <#\>But<,> I think<,> they were random<,> though<,,>
<$A> <#\>No <#\>They randomised within that I think
<$F> <#\>Mmm <#\><{><[>They they actually</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
<$H> <#\>Oh right
<$A> <#\>You see they took advantage of <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Yeah <#\>Go
on
<$F> <#\>They they they<,> there were<,> sixty children in the
final study and they split<,> <#\>They took the top<,> twenty
one<,,> and they<,> then<,> randomly took the top twenty
one<,> split them amomgst the group a b and c<,,> <#\>Then they
took the middle group of eighteen and randomly split those<,>
against<,,> between the three groups and then they did the
same with the bottom twenty one <#\>So it was only random in<,>
they've chose<,> you took three out of the top group <{><[><,></[> 
and
<$?> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>It it's the sort of technique that they call
randomisation of matched groups<,> or matched triads <#\>Usually
it's matched pairs<,,> <#\>So there is randomisation within it
but you first<,> make sure that you've got um<,> three equ
three um<,,> groups who are good<,> average<,> and poor<,> <#\>So
that of course brings us to what type of study it is <#\>And this
one is easy because we've already talked about it<,,> <#\>So<,>
who feels like something easy<,,> <#\>Did I say
<@>firstname2</@> <,> <#\>It wasn't <O>inaudible</O>
<@>firstname3</@> do you feel like something easy
<$I> <#\>Yeah <O>laughter</O> 
<$A> <#\>Or maybe something hard <#\>I don't know
<$I> <#\>It's um<,,> definitely empirical because of all the
statistics<,> and graphs<,> and things <{><[><,></[> band also it's
theoretical 'cos they've got<,,> all the different views of
all<,,> um <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Um<,,> <O>inaudible</O> those
two
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
     <#\>Right<,> <#\>Any<,> other um<,,>
<$F> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\><{><[>It's also process</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So we have the empirical</[></{> <,,> and we have theoretical
<$F> <#\>Also process<,,>
<$A> <#\>In the sense that it talks about<,>the processes in
um<,,> anaphoric relationships <#\><{><[>Yes</[> <#\>But I think its
actually got one other component
<$F> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>  <&> class calls <O>Interventionist</O></&>
<$A> <#\>Interventionist<,> because it actually put in<,> some
sort of intervention<,> <#\>So this is one of those<,> that
um<,,> actually intervene on the quality of the student<,> <#\>So
it would cover emperical<,> interventionist<,> process<,>
theoretical<,,> and I s'pose review maybe<,,> <#\>OK<,> do you
think this might be a good time to look at what an anaphoric
relationship is<,> before we actually get onto<,> what they
do<,,> <#\>Um<,> who feels<,> reasonably confident<,> that they
can give us<,> an idea<,> even if we don't go into ah<,> a
tremendous amount of detail<,> <#\>Which they do<,,> <#\>And I think
even if you<,> look at page<,> seventy five<,> and look at the
list <O>inaudible</O><,,> that will help<,> and look at<,,>
let me see <#\>Look at the end<,,>
<$D> <#\>On pages seventy seven and seventy eight they actually
give some examples too
<$A> <#\>Um<,,> <#\>Seventy seven<,> <O>inaudible</O> 
<$D> <#\><O>inaudible</O> cloze tests on<,> seventy three<,,>
<$A> <#\>OK thanks <@>firstname4</@> <#\>Right<,> <#\>So we can
actually<,> use their examples<,,> <#\>Alright<,> who feels that
they can<,> tell us a little bit about anaphoric
relationships <#\>Somebody who hasn't said anything for ages<,,>
<@>firstname4</@> <,> have you said anything<,> for ages <#\>How
about you say something <O>Glaughs</O>
<$J> <#\>I'll say something pretty basic <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>That's OK</[></{> <#\>Say something pretty basic<,>
<$J> <#\>I think it's something to do with<,> um two sets of<,>
either words or phrases which um<,,> ah<,> the second phrase
ah<,> has some way of explaining the first one or the second
word has some way of explaining the<,> the first one
<$A> <#\>Right<,> <#\>Where<,> sort of two<,> phrases or two words or
a word and a phrase<,,> where the second one<,> in this
particular research it's the second one <#\>It needn't be the
second one <#\>Refers back<,> to what was mentioned in the first
sentence<,> <#\>Anyone<,,> elaborate on that<,> and give us<,> an
example<,> because the definition<,> is OK but it's much
easier to have an example for it<,> <#\>Yeah <#\>Come on
<@>firstname1</@> <#\>What would you say
<$B> <#\>Well first of all I'd say anaphore is simply just words
that stand for other words<,> basically and<,> an example
would be<,> instead of having the that<,> <quote> John ate three
green apples<,> then he got sick</quote> <,> <#\>He is the anaphoric
term<,> um<,> that refers to the antecedent John in that first
sentence
<$A> <#\>So that's a<,> it's probably one of the simplist<,> or
earliest rules you learn in grammar<,> and they give you the
example of using John and Mary all the time<,> of getting a
pronoun<,> to stand for a noun<,> <#\>And if you look at the word
pronoun<,> it actually means<,> for a noun<,,> so um<,> even
calling<,> he she and it pronouns actually defines<,> their
place<,> in<,> English grammar <#\>I think the only hard part is
that it's called anaphora<,,> 
<$D> <#\>But don't they add a bit more <#\>Don't they say that it's
not just<,> words that stand for other words it's the<,>
relationship as <@>firstname5</@> said<,,> from one to the
other<,> and back again <{1><[1><,,> and</[1> it's got to do with the
whole structure rather than just a simple <{2><[2>substitution</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>That's right <#\>Yes</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Well<,> if</[2></{2> you can see<,> they<,> have quite a
number<,> <#\>There is a table<,> where they actually where they
actually go through<,> and tell you<,> the order in which
they<,> teach them<,,> and on page<,> eighty three<,,> where
they look at it<,> <#\>You know sometimes I think it's the
definitions<,> or the names that make it so difficult</I>
