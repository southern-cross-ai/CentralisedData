<I><$A> <#\>I think we were able to steer a course between on the
one hand<,> repeating our well known position about not believing
in the appropriateness of  trade policy conditionality which was
music to their ears but on the other hand making very clear that
we thought there were a number of major human rights problems
which did need to be addressed which I spelt out in some detail
involving political dissidents obviously involving the issue of
executions and a number of things of that kind
<$B> <#\>But but do they listen to that at all <#\>I mean <{><[>do they</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Well they listen</[></{> they listen and they are prepared
to acknowledge as they have to indeed now that these<,> issues
are a legitimate subject of<,> international discourse<,> that
the rights in question were recognised and reaffirmed at the
Vienna Conference last year that they're enshrined in universal
declaration that they're not just a<,> a western hangup<,> that
they are a legitimate for debate and I think with the Chinese
we've pretty well established that already over the last two or
three years in particular<,> with these delegations that've gone
to China and have<,> been engaged in really quite systematic and
sensible debate on all the relevant issues
<$B> <#\>So you think it's just<,> really a you know  patient ah
government to government ah talks or<,> should we do something
through the U N or what
<$A> <#\>Well I think it's about our working through the
multilateral<,> agencies the Human Rights Commission and Geneva
keeping the<,> the interest up the focus up and in that sense the
pressure up <#\>It's a matter of working away at this um<,>
bilateral level to indicate that these are real issues that
they<,> have to respond to if they want to have a reasonably
civilised dialogue with us and it's a matter also of patience
<#\>Lets face it that a lot of this stuff is going to happen
anyway <{><[>as</[> political liberalisation succeeds on the course of
economic liberalisation
<$B> <#\><[>Right</[></{> 
     <#\>How patient should we be<,> <#\><{1><[1>I mean six months down the track</[1> I mean you know we're um what<,> will your assessment
be <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Well not so patient</[1></{1> 
<$A> <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2> some people like <@>fullname1</@> say well
you<,> you may have to wait generations ah for this natural
course to ah take it's way <#\>I don't accept that because
something might be inevitable you should therefore do nothing to
accelerate it nothing to encourage it<,> and that is of course
the reason why ah we make so much of this particular issue
because we think it is<,> an entirely legitimate matter of
universal international interest and we press the point
accordingly <#\>I might also say that we raised the Hong Kong
issue ah as we always do and on this occasion ah that one passed
through to the keeper pretty much without demure so<,> there is
a sense in which ah you do get some results if you keep working
away
<$B> <#\>What do you mean by that term that it passed through to
the keeper
<$A> <#\>Well I mean I said in a<,> couple of my exchanges aren't
you going to belt me around the ears ah because of what I've been
continuing to say <{1><[1>on</[1> the subject of democratisation of Hong
Kong <{2><[2>and</[2> I just met with a fairly<,> robust chuckle and next
topic please so <{3><[3><,></[3> there is a sense in which that one has
gone off the boil 
<$B> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Sure</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3> 
     <#\>What do we do about er prominent dissidents who keep on
getting imprisoned um when dignitaries like yourself <,> um visit
China <#\>I mean what can we do about that
<$A> <#\>Well that phenomenon's been going on for<,> time
immemorial of course not only when visiting<,> people have been
there but in the context of  major local political events like
the National Party Congress which has occurred over recent weeks
<#\>I think these cases are so high profile and the Chinese are
so conscious<,> of their significance in the context of  pr'haps
starting another<,> democracy movement were they allowed to<,>
go ah unsuppressed that we're not going to see much progress on
those very high profile individual cases but my hope and
expectation is that<,> there will be sufficient progress across
a range of genuine human rights issues for example prison labour
and so on ah  to make it possible for the issue with the United
States to be resolved but it's a fine call
<$B> <#\>Yes indeed but um as you say um you think the leadership
ah in China is um<,> worried about um ah ah another democracy
move and therefore they will crack down and continue to crack
down 
<$A> <#\>I think they're absolutely determined Paul to ensure
that the snowball doesn't start rolling down the hill <#\>I don't
think that's necessarily a sign<,> of weakness or fragility or
lack of confidence generally in the Chinese leadership <#\>I
think that's a bit of a <O>inaudible</O> <{><[>um</[> that some commentators
have ah but what they are determined to do is place an
overwhelming priority on<,> economic reform to hold the line as
firmly as they possibly can on political reform and I think that
view is pretty universal ah whoever might prove to succeed ah
<@>Surname2</@> in due course
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Well I was going to say with <@>Fullname2</@> obviously um you
know getting on in years<,> um um and er um I mean er ah <{><[>his demise</[> I mean what do we expect then
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
     <#\>Well there's a lot of speculation obviously about that
<#\>The mood that I can discern is one of quiet confidence that
that particular transition will be managed probably with some
kind of collective leadership no doubt with some personalities
as in our own political system having more clout than others but
I think it'll be a more formalised more transparent more visible
governmental process in the future <{><[>and</[> not one that will
represent I think any fundamental sea change in the current of
evolution we're seeing in China at the moment
<$B> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
     <#\>Yes <#\>Okay <#\>Ah Foreign Minister um<,> um the Khmer
Rouge once again<,> are fighting the central<,> government in
Cambodia now your<,> appeal to them to as you put it<quote> hang up
their guns</quote> <,> but ah<,> will they
<$A> <#\>Well I doubt very much that they will given the present
mentality that does seem to be prevailing among the hardcore
leadership <#\>The point does continue to be worth making that
if they are prepared to acknowledge the legitimacy of the elected
government they are prepared to relinquish their hold on such
territory as they possess <{><[>which</[> isn't very much any more if
they are prepared to stop fighting<,> ah then it's not
unreasonable that they should engage in some kind of negotiations
toward a reconciliation toward a place in the government
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
     <#\>Now King <@>Name3</@> is seriously ill um <#\>Now if he
succumbs to that illness<,> um couldn't we have er a completely
different situation um <{><[><,> at</[> 
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> when I saw him in Beijing he was in ah
remarkedly lively ebullient form and ah giving the lie to a
number of those reports you've been reading about ah<{1><[1><,></[1> 
emaciated and ah <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1> <[2>He</[2></{2> he's in good health is he
<$A> <#\>Well I mean he's in good<,> as good a health as anyone
who's been through a severe bout of chemo ah can be and with some
residual ah cancer in his system and I don't think ah you know
the odds are strong <{><[>for</[> a very long ah ah period with us but
I'm I certainly think the notion of an imminent demise is ah is
much exaggerated but e even so I think though the point is that
the Cambodian government as presently constituted is much more
likely than not to survive ah his passing intact <#\>They are
working<,> cooperatively and sensibly ah together <#\>There are
endless problems that remain to be resolved <#\>There are policy
vacuums that remain to be filled <#\>There's an enormous amount
of reconstruction that has to go on but they are managing and the
spirit is good
<$B> <#\><[>Sure</[></{> 
     <#\>Ah Mr Keating has returned from a successful um Asian
tour except for<,> Vietnam um<,> now you may ah challenge me on
that um but did he get wrong advice<,> from our bureaucracy er
in not commemorating our five hundred war dead in Vietnam
<$A> <#\>Well I think the only advice he got was that there was
no obvious location in Vietnam ah of a kind that's existed in the
other places where he has made such an act of commemoration
simply because there are no war graves<,> <#\>And apart from that
I mean ah the judgement ah was made and it's an understandable
judgement <{><[>ah</[> within those circumstances and also given the
obvious<,> continuing sensitivity of this issue with the
Vietnamese<,> that it might be better to ah celebrate our our war
dead at home ah which is of course what we've already done and
we'll continue ah to do
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Okay but obviously here of course er you know um<,>
there are high emotions<,> <#\>What what about um Long Tan the
the famous battle of Long Tan er as a possible memorial site
because <{><[>um</[> the punt the punters they have said that er er you
know um there should be a mor memorial set up
<$A> <#\><[>Sure</[></{> 
     <#\>Well I guess that is one obvious candidate for that role
and that's something that can be sensibly and quietly discussed
now that some of the political partisanship seems likely to go
out of this particular issue <#\>Now I think the er the head of
the R S L Digger James put it very well when he said ah you know
there's been far too much political pointscoring on this issue 
<#\>Let's just<,> give these people who died serving their
country the appropriate measure of dignity they're due ah as the
Prime Minister<,> you know was obviously determined to do in
commemorating their role as he did a couple of years ago ah with
the parades and so on in Sydney and I think we'll work out a way
of ensuring that on future trips ah that contribution is
appropriately acknowledged through some memorial
<$B> <#\>Okay <#\>Foreign Minister many thanks for talking to
Dateline</I>

<S1B-045b> <318>
<I><$A> <#\>Mr Fraser it's obviously no secret<,> that um there
are<,> continuing problems in the Liberal Party ah and that
obviously<,> John Hewson continues to be under pressure as leader
<#\>Do you think<,> that Australians understand what the Liberals
stand for
<$B> <#\>No I don't <#\>Ah in the period up to the last election
er people did not understand and were concerned and fearful about
fightback and the G S T<,> <#\>Since that election ah we've been
told on a number of occasions that fightback is dead<,> then
we're told that parts of it are still alive<,> then it was
allegedly finally interred ah at the ah Liberal Party weekend ah
a little while ago<,> but<,> knocking off a document like that
that's six hundred pages long<,> um<,> you know it's only half
the story <#\>The other half of the story and the more important
part<,> and I'm certainly not suggesting another six hundred page
document<,> is to have in the simplest terms<,> um people
understand what the Liberal Party itself<,> stands for
<$A> <#\>In other words Australia needs<,> ah in your view<,> a
strong Opposition to debate all this sort of thing and it hasn't
got it
<$B> <#\>There has been no real debate about economic policy for
quite a long while<,> The main line of whatever the Government's
been doing and the Reserve Bank have  been doing have in many
ways been accepted<,> with the Liberals often saying that the
Government hasn't gone far enough <#\>Now it's a very odd
solution to an illness if you can<,,> compare the economy to<,>
to somebody who's ill for a moment<,> to say that<,> a little of
something has made me sick if you take much more of that same
thing<,> you'll become better and I think Australians have been
very sceptical<,> of that approach <#\>We we now have built in
unemployment of massive proportions<,> have built in and rising
and overseas debt<,,></I>
