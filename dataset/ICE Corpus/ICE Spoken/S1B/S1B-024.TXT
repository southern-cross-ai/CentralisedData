<S1B-024> <2000>
<I><$A> <#\>Chris Jessup do you acknowledge any significant problems in the Australian judiciary particularly on crimes against women or or has<,,> the recent spate of reported cases been exaggerated
<$B> <#\><O>cough</O> Well Kerry I think the recent um<,> spate as you call them of reported cases has ah<,,> regrettably become something of a media event <#\>By which I mean that the agenda which the media is um<,,> ah<,> pursuing here has tended to obscure the individual circumstances of each ah<,> case and the context in which it arose <#\>Now it would seem that the major<,,> ah charge which is levelled against the judiciary<,> is that it is unsympathetic to the position of<,,> female victims particularly in rape cases<,> and if you actually look at the statements made by the<,> judges in two of the three cases you've referred to in your introduction<,> ah you will find that that charge couldn't be sustained<,> um<,> in either of those instances <#\>Now<,> if I may just <{><[>indicate</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>W which</[></{> two of the three are you referring to
<$B> <#\>I'm talking about the<,> ah the last one you referred to the Wodonga one which was Justice O'Brien<,,> and the<,> one prior to that<,> ah Judge Bland <#\>Now I don't seek to say<,> that Judge Bland was right to say that no sometimes means yes<,,> in the circumstances of the case which was a plea for guil er a plea of guilty<,> ah because there was no<,,> doubt but that in that case no did mean no <#\>I don't think that the judge really intended to say otherwise in the context of that case
<$A> <#\>Well why why would he have said what he said anyway<,> <#\>Given that he is a judge and knows full well that his words have a particular weight<,>
<$B> <#\>Well<,> he was um<,> he was ah engaged in a very long discussion with council<,> ah in in connection with what sentence ought to be apposed on a young offender who just missed out on being dealt with in the children's court <#\>In fact the<,> offender had turned eighteen at the end of<,> proceedings which took place a year after the offence so<,> he started out in the<,> children's court and ended up getting committed<,> and there were a lot of things that went to and fro between council and the judge but what I wanted to come down to was when<,> the sentencing actually came down to it the judge was<,> very very stern <#\>He really read the riot act to that offender and made it very clear to him<,> that the community viewed rape<,> very seriously and if I might may just read you something that he said
<$A> <#\>Briefly
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>He said<,><quote> I want you to clearly understand that the crime of rape<,> is one of the most serious crimes that any citizen can commit<,> and is so regarded by our parliament and I might say in my opinion by the community as a whole</quote> <#\>Now if you're concerned about the values<,> which a<,,> judge brings onto the bench with him or her<,,> then those are the values which that judge brought <#\>Now I say that without defending the actual<,> <{><[>ah</[> extract which you had on the screen before but nonetheless<,> that's his value system<,> and I think that's the value that he brings to the overall context of trying a ah<,> charge of rape
<$A> <#\><[>Right</[></{> 
	<#\>And you'd make the point about Justice O'Brien in the Wodonga case I imagine that he expressed strong censure on the issue of violence against women<,> <{><[>but but</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Very strong</[></{> censure
<$A> <#\>But but nonetheless the Appeal Court found<,> that he had erred on the point of<,,> reducing the sentence because the woman was apparently unconscious when he actually raped her <{><[><,></[> <#\>You don't defend that do you
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
	<#\>No <#\>I don't <#\>No <#\>The full court has spoken and nothing more needs to be said about that <#\>That was a mistake of a of a sentencing kind<,> ah ah but it did not in my opinion<,,> ah demonstrate the wrong value system held by the judge at the time
<$A> <#\>OK <#\>Jocelyn Scutt ah<,> how indicative do you believe these cases are of a wider problem in the judiciary of Australia
<$C> <#\>Well<,> judges themselves have acknowledged that there is a problem as I understand it <#\>For example in Western Australia the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court there<,> Justice David Malcolm<,> has acknowledged that it is important for judges to have training in relation to non-sexism and non<,>racial bias <#\>The problem I see with the cases that've been<,> ah that've gained<,> ah media coverage to date is that sometimes they're seen as individual instances rather than being seen as part of a much deeper<,> problem<,> and I also think it's important to note that it is not<,> only in relation to crimes of violence against women that there are real problems <#\>There are very real problems in relation to<,,> women<,> who appear in courts as accused and biases<,> in terms of the way that various laws such as prova provocation and self defence are applied<,> to them<,> and that also there are very real problems for people ah who are<,> Murris<,> Kooris<,> Nungas<,,> Aboriginal people<,> and also people of ethnic origin other than Anglo-Australian
<$A> <#\>OK <#\>Well w ah let's<,> let's keep to women at the moment<,> and we'll widen it out towards the end but ah<,,> but are you saying that that these flaws in the system are wide spread<,> that<,> that there is a bias against women in the law<,> as it's applied from the Bench<,> which is widespread
<$C> <#\>Well<,> it seems to me that it would be a nonsense to just suggest that there isn't<,> ah sexism within the courts <#\>Parliaments around Australia have acknowledged<,> that there is discrimination<,> on sex grounds<,> within the community generally<,> and within<,> our institutions <#\>It therefore would be astounding<,> to put a proposition that it's not<,> ah present within the courts <#\>I also should say<,> that there are members of the judiciary who are very well aware<,> and very concerned<,> about<,> doing something positive about<,> eliminating sexism so far as they are able<,> and also other biases and prejudices
<$A> <#\>Are you ah ah are you saying that that many<,,> experienced male judges are not capable of properly comprehending<,> the crime of rape<,> for example<,,>
<$C> <#\>I think<,,> my heart is concerned<,> about that issue <#\>I think that<,,> for any thinking person<,> there is a very real concern when we have contradictory messages coming<,> from people who're in extreme positions of authority <#\>I prefer not to<,> comment upon the particular cases but it does seem to me that if on the one hand<,> one has members of the judiciary saying<,> that the law there is not one law for women who work as prostitutes and one law<,> for other people<,> and then on the other hand make a finding<,> that if a woman works as a prostitute<,> she is less harmed<,> psychologically by having been raped<,> and if we find members of the judiciary saying on the one hand<,> that rape is<,> a crime<,> that remains with the woman<,> ah on a very long term basis<,> and then on the other hand says<,,> that if a person's comatosed<,> in the course of a rape then she's not traumatised<,> ah or if a judge says<,> words to the effect that crimes of violence against women<,> are extremely serious<,> and ought to be dealt with and are dealt with by the courts in that way<,> and on the other hand<,> trivialises a a woman saying no<,> in circumstances where she is saying no to sexual intercourse and where<,> we<,> as women<,> are unable to determine any other word<,> that exists within the language to signify a negative<,> than no<,,> then it seems to me that we do have<,> a a a<,> situation that is extremely<,> serious<,> and it seems to me although I would prefer not to think this is so<,> that if all the women I know<,> whether they've been raped or they haven't been raped<,> are absolutely conscious<,> and very well aware<,> of<,> the damage that's done to women by rape and the fact that<,> there are millions of women walking around the world<,> who<,> are on their two legs<,> who appear as if there's not a problem and yet inside they're bleeding<,> because of<,> the damage that they've suffered <#\>If all the women I know<,> raped or not<,> are capable of understanding that<,> there is a very real concern if members of the<,> male judiciary do not seem<,> to be able to comprehend in full<,> degree what the problem is
<$A> <#\>OK <#\>Chris Jessup ah are you saying that the vast bulk of judges are well equipped to try any case including the range of cases of violence against women that there is no problem of gender bias<,,> in the judiciary
<$B> <#\>Ah <{><[>er</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>No</[></{> no<,,> broad<,> or incipient problem of gender <{><[>bias</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> Yes yes <#\>I am saying that Kerry<,> um <#\>I must say that I<,,> I I I can't accept that um<,> our judges<,> are not able to appreciate the long term psychological trauma that comes with rape<,> and those are the very um things<,> very kind of thing which is repeatedly pointed out by judges passing sentences<,> including the ah the one that you referred to Justice Brien <#\>He referred to, O'Brien, he referred to long term psychological trauma<,> and ah<,> you you will find if you if you look at the cases that there is um<,> an absolute abhorrence of the crime of rape and an understanding of the psychological<,,> and emotional as well as the<,> physical assault which is occasioned by rape
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>So so no serious cause for concerned about ah concern about the<,> gender imbalance<,> in the judiciary<,,> <#\>The very marked gender imbalance
<$B> <#\>Um<,> oh<,> no <#\>I wouldn't<,> I wouldn't say there is any cause for concern about that Kerry but that's not to say that it it it's not going to change over a period of time <#\>I think that with the change in the profession<,> ah you will inevitably get a change in the judiciary but what you've got to understand is<,> that people come onto the bench<,> ah when they are paid quite substantial amounts of taxpayers dollars to do a job and to do it well<,,> and normally they only get there after they've had a<,> very lengthy career practising law<,> so as um<,,> as women work their way up through the ranks of practising lawyers<,> ultimately they will come to be on the bench in much greater numbers<,> ah and they will be there on their merits um <#\><{><[>I should say</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So so</[></{> maybe in twenty or thirty years time we might start to see the the numbers of women increase slightly
<$B> <#\>Well I should think that it will be more than slightly and it will be less than twenty or thirty <{><[>years time</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh I was</[></{> talking about a lot of experience <#\>I mean ah<,,> what've we got <#\>We've got<,> none in Victoria <#\>No judge no women judges in the in in the 
<$B> <#\>We don't have any<,> any women judges on the Supreme Court or the County Court <{1><[1>but</[1> your introduction didn't refer to Magistrates <#\>Most cases<,> that people come into contact with um<,,> will be dealt with by Magistrates and we have of course a Chief<,> Magistrate in Victoria who is a woman<,> and that's not to say that um<,> that the magistrates would here a a rape trial for example <{2><[2>but</[2> but ordinary<,> cases that people will come into contact with from day to day will be heard by Magistrates <#\>Could I um<,,> before I finish could I just say <{3><[3><,> Kerry</[3> that<,,> ah despite what you put in your introduction about fifteen percent or less going to the Bar<,,> over the last three years or so<,,> about thirty percent of the people who come to the Bar have been women <#\>I'm talking now about Melbourne figures
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1> 
	<#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
	<#\><[3>Quickly yeah</[3></{3> 
	<#\>Right <#\>OK</I>
