<I><$A>   <#\>Do you want to<,> briefly sketch in why you think
it reached flashpoint and<,,> ah why it ended the way<,>
<{><[>it</[> did and then we'll take discussion<,> as a<,,>
whole I think
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[> </{>
     <#\>Okay<,,> <#\>Okay <#\>Well the students  oh
sorry   on the<,> <#\>Just get a date here<,,> um <#\>Yes
<#\>Towards the end of<,> what was it the end of April I think<,>
the secretary Hu  Hu   Yong Bung died<,> and ah
his replacement was a fellow by the name of Zhou Ze Yong<,> and
when this character came to power the students particularly were
um<,,> quite disgusted I suppose<,> because he was a real right
winger and um they decided that now was their time to make  make   a move against um not just  not the party   as such but ah a big push for
modernisation throughout China<,> and so protests started um very
peaceful ones in Beijing<,,> <#\>Um<,> as it went on it became
apparent to the um <,>  those   inside the
communist party that with ah the election of Zhou Ze Yong<,>
that<,> um<,> Deng Zhou Ping who was the general secretary at the
time<,> pretty much wielded complete control of the entire
party<,> and he again was a right  very much a right
winger   and he pretty much controlled<,> ah Zhou Ze
Yong<,> um <#\>What he basically did was because of the Chinese
political system which<,> basically highlights the power of the
individual towards the top and ver  and gives very
few   people<,> any power at the top of the actual party
even when though there's forty seven million members of the
actual party um<,> there was no sort of institution<,,> to fall
back on when um things got<,> hot in Beijing and he pretty
much just dec  Deng Zhou Ping pretty much just
declared   martial law himself<,> and sent in his most
loyal troops<,> to break up student demonstrations<,,> and when
this happened<,> lots of the army revolted as well but<,> he
managed to because again it was mainly his personality
influencing decisions not the whole party<,> he was pretty much
able to control enough of the army to put down the rebellion in
the army and indeed to crush the fairly<,> what had been up till
then very peaceful demonstrations in Bejing and other cities<,,>
<$A> <#\>Thanks very much for that <#\>Ah questions<,> and
comments<,,> 
<$C> <#\>I've got a question about um in a lecture I think he was
trying to say that<,,> with all the street demonstrations because
they had  didn't have   like a united front or
someone<,> who could like talk to the government that by sending
the troops that was really their last resort <{><[><,></[><,> that
they had to do something
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
     <#\>Yeah well my
<$C> <#\>Like<,>  
<$B> <#\>I have to confess I<,,> <O>laughs</O> um but from the
readings I sort of found that because of the way their whole
<O>inaudible</O> was structured <{1><[1><,></[1><,> because of the way
their whole political structure's organised<,> it was impossible
for the students to contact<,> those <{2><[2>who</[2> were
actually making the decisions <w>'cos</w> that was there
was<,> supposedly not even the real um  there's supposed to
be   a um<,> something like an upper<,,> legislature or
something <O>inaudible</O> and<,> apparently only about six
members<,> actually had anything to do with ah declaring martial
law and it was all<,> basically run by Deng Zhou Ping himself
<#\>Therefore<,> the students might have been able to contact the
lower members of the communist party but because they had no<,>
contact with the upper<,,> when martial or the <,>
 they couldn't   say anything <#\>Basically the  they   were out here in the street and you've got these
five or six<,> people in the um parliament themselves and they
<O>inaudible</O> and<,> as you said they had no option because<,>
the couldn't communicate with them because<,>  there's no way<,>
five people off in a room are gonna communicate with you know
thousands thronging the square and so they had no other choice
but to send in the
<$D> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1> 
<$C> <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2> 
<$E> <#\>I don't understand<,,> <O>laughter</O> <#\>I don't
understand why<,> they would have to send in the military <#\>It
doesn't make sense  
<$B> <#\>Because  I think   because of the
failure of their political system because of the way the
political system was run
<$E> <#\>It was just a demonstration
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>I agree but <{><[>because there's</[> such
a mass of people
<$C> <#\><[>But what</[></{> 
     <#\>What was the future of the demonstration <#\>What
could it  what could happen   by them keeping
demonstrating to <w>'cos</w> it was going on for a while
<{1><[1>when they</[1> <#\>There was a hunger strike
<{2><[2>so</[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>That's</[2></{2> right the hunger strike really
<{1><[1>sparked</[1> the um <,>  the  
government and I mean I'm not saying that it was right to send
in the <{2><[2><,>military</[2> but the way they had organised
their political structure because Deng Zhou Ping himself felt
that he should put down this revolution<,,> he um basically said
<quote> oh<,> I'll declare martial law</quote> and the rest of the
party said <quote> oh you can't do that</quote> but when the
hunger strike started<,> they feared<,,> the um<,> the
whole country might start<,,> well not the whole country but
their own party and the military <,,> and so they sent
the military in to crush the students as a the demonstration<,,>
<$C> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
<$E> <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2> 
<$A> <#\>This idea of a revolt from inside the party as well as
a protest from outside's<,> an interesting one<,> um<,,> <#\>Why
do you think the party members would be out of sorts about<,,>
Deng's<,,> <#\>I mean<,> <O>inaudible</O>this during the nineteen
eighties<,,> <#\>Why is the communist party itself<,> so<,>
divided<,,> by this stage<,> 
<$F> <#\>Doesn't it have a whole lot<,> to do with economics<,>
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>So you'd see<,> some of the benefits of
what's happening<,> to a lot of other communist ah countries<,>
and they've probably seen<,> a similar path <#\>I dunno though
I mean<,> that probably<,> flaws were starting to show in<,>
the <,>  the   doctrine <#\>I mean<,> their sort of um<,,> their  their   um people  people   obviously weren't happy <w>'cos</w>
they were involved in<,> those um<,> so like if some people
aren't happy the people in charge think well they're never going
to be happy either<,> and it's gonna lead to you know sort of
unfamiliar change <O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\>But there was still the Mao legacy within the party
itself with Mao towards the end of his reign having totally
contradicted all his earlier policies <#\>The communist party
committee weren't sure <#\>They didn't have this definitive line
that they were following any more <#\>They <,>
 basically their   whole party platform was<,> cut from
underneath them by Mao and he their  you know<,> their
beginnings   were taken from <{><[>underneath them</[>
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{>
<$G> <#\>Yeah
<$H> <#\>Wasn't there a split between those who wanted reform and
those who didn't<,,>  
<$C> <#\>And how far to go with the reforms
<$G> <#\>Mmm<,,> and the martial law influence as well was
still<,> heavily<,> magnified in it<,,> 
<$B> <#\>Old style stalinist
<$G> <#\>Mmm<,,> 
<$A> <#\>So that once they'd decided that socialist forms of
economic<,> organisation didn't work or centrally controlled
ones<,,> ah they had a problem on their hands I guess<,,>
<#\>And<,> a lot of<,> enterprise<,> went into the form
presumably of<,> um coercion between<,> entrepreneurs and other
officials who are meant to be acting on behalf of the peoples<,>
which really had a way of taking their own cousins out to drive
around in a mercedes with their<,> all their brothers along the
back and so on <#\>Did you<,,> take <@>firstnameM1</@> 's point
about corruption because it's a really highly charged issue in
the <#\><{><[>Sorry <@>firstnameB</@> </[>
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O> <#\>It's</[></{> all right
<$A> <#\>Ah <@>firstnameB</@> 's point about corruption<,> <#\>I
mean we talk about corruption in Australian poltics but<,> in
China's politics it seems to be<,> horrendously entrenched there
<#\>It's in Japanese politics as well which is a pity<,,> 
<$G> <#\>Can I just ask you to clarify <#\>I'm not really clear
on how <#\>I understand how the Japanese<,> um parties are
elected but I'm not really clear on how the Chinese<,> leaders
come to power <#\>Is it<,> similar to the Japanese form<,,>
<#\>Perhaps we'll be getting more into that <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>You'll <{1><[1>have to recall the</[1> lectures <#\>We
were given that <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$G> <#\><[1>We're getting more into that</[1></{1>
<$G> <#\><[2><w>'Cos</w> I </[2></{2>  I  
missed that  that   lecture<,> <{><[>but if
you've already covered</[> that it's okay
<$A> <#\><[>Questions <O>inaudible</O></[></{>
     <#\>Well let's look at <O>inaudible</O> <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>She said that it would be<,> something with something
<{><[><,></[><,> <O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\><w>'Cos</w> I was just wondering if it  <w>'cos</w> basically   is it similar to the Japanese
in that it's <,>  whereas   the Japanese when
they've got people<,,> that have been elected from the <,>  from<,> the   streets themselves from the<,>
different areas then it's <,>  it's   easier for
corruption <#\>Like the thing I was just wondering if the Chinese
political party was<,> that far removed from the people maybe
they weren't elected from areas or something or<,,> <#\>I don't
really understand how it <{><[>works</[>
<$A> <#\><[>There</[></{> are two parallel systems aren't
there <#\>I mean one is the system of election the other is the
system of the communist <{1><[1>party's</[1> hierarchy
<{2><[2><,></[2><,> and as <@>firstnameB</@> pointed out in fact<,> the
key decisions<,,> tend to be taken by ingroups<,> in the upper
levels of the communist party<,> and in some cases<,>
particularly with the orders to the military or to the royal
military it seems<,,> that<,> the decisions were made
deliberately be not inviting certain people to the meetings or
to the faction within<,,> an <{3><[3>elite</[3><,,> and this was
one of the complaints of course<,> against the whole system
because it was a facade of<,,> representation<,> because it was
so conceptualised that<,> <O>inaudible</O> no opportunity for
<O>inaudible</O> to be called <{4><[4><,></[4><,> <#\>Finally
the <,,>  finally the   <O>inaudible</O> you know<,>
<O>inaudible: someone coughing</O> reasons<,> or else the army
would have to be brought to keep the lid down<,,>
<#\><O>inaudible</O><,,> <#\>Look any comments  any
last comments   about any of those questions on the Chinese
grasp<,,> <#\>Right well look let's move to the Japanese part
of the question um and give Kazuhiro um<,,> ah some help if
he  if he   needs it um<,> because um<,> well<,,> he's
here with English  English   not a first
language though it's quite clear that<,,> ah he's very competent
indeed at it
<$G> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Finally</[4></{4>
          <&>break in transcription for presentation by non-
corpus speaker</&>
<$A> <#\>One of the things that's always struck me is the
way<,,> in which Japan <,>  what happens in
Japan   happens in most of the rest of the western world
up to a certain point and then Japan stays with the same party
in government and everybody else starts getting angry with their
government and chucking them out and I was thinking<,> it's
sometimes argued that beyond the sense of the cold war it's<,>
the conservatives the  the L D P   in power in
Japan<,> ah in the late nineteen forties<,,> um at the same time
of course as the Menzies government came to power in Australia
while other conservative governments gained power<,> with
American approval elsewhere in the <,>  in the  
world<,> um<,,> <#\>In this sense<,> is Japan really ah very much
different from<,,> the rest of the post war world<,,> or<,> if
it starts off being the same where does it become different 
<$E> <#\>Well everybody else has managed to get rid of their
governments<,,> 
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O> in America for<,> quite a long time
they had conservative governments in power I think<,> <#\>About
three<,,> ah <#\>All through the um <,>  you know the
Vietnam war   and<,,> that period of time
<$A> <#\>Well the Americans<,> had all their republican
<{1><[1>administrations</[1> under Eisenhower and sort of
<{2><[2>post-war</[2> and then they had the Kennedy era which was
meant to be young and glamorous wasn't it
<$C> <#\><[1>Yeah yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>But then that changed<,> <#\>So maybe that  they   sort of had<,,> a republican one I think for
quite a while<,> 
<$A> <#\>Yes but<,> that's meant to be the difference isn't it
between<,,> Americans<,> West Europeans<,> and Australians
that<,,> they had a way of<,> getting excited and kicking out
governments and putting new ones in and then getting disgusted
by them and kicking them out in turn <#\>In other words a sort
of a pendulum<,> whereas with the Japanese experience<,> the
pendulum swung and never came back again or not until two months
ago
<$F> <#\>I suppose if you're in a country that's<,,> leading the
world or starting to<,> get  become   really
prosperous and then<,> also<,> you're used to<,> an emperor for
a leader which is an<,> autocratic person and you're used to him
being the leader and<,> by having no choice and then suddenly
giving them election<,> when you elect all your leaders it's sort of you  you're gonna   stick with people
you know most of the time</I>
