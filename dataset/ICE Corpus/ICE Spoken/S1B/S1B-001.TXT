<&>LING 253  3/9/92</&>
<I><$A> <#\>What I want to do with these is to um use them as a
grist for the mill of answering a general question <#\>Um, what
are reviews like and what makes a satisfactory review, or a
satisfying review <#\>Now we could start just by saying um what
do you like to find in a review <#\>Um, a assuming you read
reviews <#\>Do you <#\>Or  perhaps I should um not  take that for granted <#\>Do
do you read reviews
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Or maybe you know other people who do, that kind of
thing <O>laugh</O> <#\>Yeah <#\>Um, when you read a review, ah, or if
you
were to go to a review, what would you want to get out of it
<,>
<$C> <#\>What the book's about
<$A> <#\>What the book's about <#\>So, you're interested in
content
<$C> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>The the book's content <,> <#\>What else
<$D> <#\>I'm interested in whether it's a hardcover,
paperback and the price of it
<$A> <#\>The price, um, does the difference between hardcover
and paperback make <{><[>a difference</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Well it's</[></{> indicative of the price <#\>That's
probably what I was
<$A> <#\>OK
<$D> <#\>The point I was making <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\><{><[>OK</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Mm</[></{> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>How how long it would last perhaps too
<$D> <#\>No I tend to shy off it if it's, because it's too
expensive usually if it's in that in a hard
<$A> <#\>Fair enough
<$?>  <#\>Mmm
<$D> <#\>cover
<$A> <#\>You get more value for money in a paperback
<$D> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>Uh huh <,> <#\>What else <#\>Apart from price
<$E> <#\>The level at which it's presented
<$?>  <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>The level at which the book
<$E> <#\>is pre<{><[>sented</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>presents</[></{> itself <#\>You want the the reviewer to
explain the level of sophistication
<$E> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\><{><[>O K</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>And the</[></{> style
<$A> <#\>Right
<$F> <#\>That always comes through in a review as to whether
it's a comic book, or <,> 
<$A> <#\><{><[>Right,</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>or</[></{> a technical thing
<$A> <#\>So you want to know the the tone of <{><[>the book</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>The tone</[></{>, that's right
<$A> <#\>OK The tone of the book, the level of
sophistication, um <,> right, um so we we're concentrating
on what the, what it tells you about the book itself <#\>What
other aspects of the book
<$G> <#\>An opinion
<$A> <#\>An opinion
<$G> <#\>Whether it's 
<$?>  <#\>Mm
<$G> <#\>worth reading
<$A> <#\>Right um, an opinion, evaluation, if we dress it up
slightly more, um, academically <#\>Ah, do you ever wonder about
the opinion or the evaluation you're given
<$B> <#\>Mm hm
<$G> <#\>Yeah <#\>I r, I don't always take it as gospel
<$A> <#\>But you like like to <{><[>have some sort of judge</[> 
<$G> <#\><[>Yeah <O>inaudible</O> yeah</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>Gives you a starting point</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>Um, y you want that opinion to be clearly
related to something <#\>You want to be able to see what the
basis of the judgement was wouldn't you
<$F> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Like if you've got somebody like Leo Schofield
reviewing a recipe book, you know he's an expert in that
field <#\>Therefore you value his opinion or not <#\>Therefore
you
infer that onto the quality of the book
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>So you you want to know something about the
credentials of the reviewer
<$B> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>Do you <#\>I I I think I agree
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$E> <#\><{><[>Mmm</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Mm</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>The quality of the reviewer, and the experience of
him
<$A> <#\>O O K <#\>Um, experience <,> ah, O K the the
qualifications of the reviewer <#\>Ahh, and that would I suppose
affect your reaction to him, the opinion or the judgement he
delivered
<$B> <#\>Mm <,>
<$A> <#\>Um <#\>I mean, thinking of Leo Schofield, that that
he's a man who's very free with his opinions <#\>Um, he's
undoubtedly well-known as as a reviewer of of restaurants and
other things <{><[>ah</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Mm</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>He does spread himself out to all sort of cultural
phenomena too, doesn't he
<$D> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>Spreads a fairly wide net <#\>And you might think his
judgement was better in some areas than others <#\>And you also
know, with a writer such as he, that the judgements are fairly
strong
<$C> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>So I guess one of the things you want to know is
whether this writer, this reviewer, is typically somebody who
hands out strong judgements or not so strong judgements <#\>So
ideally you know something about the reviewer, to put in
perspective what he or she is actually saying about the book
<,> <#\>Do, is it possible to do that <#\>When you don't know
it's Leo Schofield <,>
<$C> <#\>Depends on how it's delivered <#\>If, you know, the
comments are very harsh or or quite direct on the book, you
you might be able to gather that yes that reviewer is maybe a
little bit opinionated
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$C> <#\>Like if you say see one review of two books in The
Australian versus The Sydney Morning Herald, two different
reviewers but the same text, or same book, you can gauge what
both of them think and how strong their opinions are and the
value of their 
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>piece
<$A> <#\>And you get some glimpses of what different things
they were reacting to in the book and, you know, maybe the as
each of them has it their judgement is right <#\>It's just
they're picking up different things
<$C> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$E> <#\>An interesting review lately was the book written by
the fellow who's the transsexual in the library
<$A> <#\>Mm hm
<$E> <#\>And I saw three reviews in that
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$E> <#\>And the one that was sort of put out by the library
was, by the university, was the most sympathetic <#\>The one in
the Herald was quite cutting and so was the other one <#\>It was
quite interesting to see the contrast that came through, when
obviously somebody might have a little bit, you know, might
tread softly for certain reasons
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>But in fact they've taken a strong stance in in
two cases out <{><[>of three</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> Mmm
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>Um, possibly effect, I wonder where the
sympathetic one appeared <#\>Was the medium of publication do you
think that maybe made a more sympathetic context for it
<$E> <#\>I think they probably knew the person, whoever wrote
the review and maybe that influenced the um
<$A> <#\>It's possible
<$E> <#\>way they reviewed it
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>One of the things we've yet to talk about is
where reviews appear <#\>And, if if say the review appears in a
newspaper, the readership is very very wide, unpredictable <#\>Um
i it's only predictable insofar as you know who typically buys
the Sydney Morning Herald <#\>So that the sort of values you're
appealing to are quite mixed, and i it's interesting if the
reviewer comes out strongly, perhaps anticipating that sort of
reader, ah for the newspaper <#\>And there may be some
traditional values, for instance, that are tied into reviews
that we don't we don't notice if we share them
<$E> <#\>Yes, although I mean one was the Sydney Morning
Herald and the other one was this new pop magazine called Who
And they, their reviews were sort of quite similar <{><[>which</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Right</[></{> 
<$E> <#\>was interesting because they'd obviously, generally
I would think cater to the, quite different types of ah
audience
<$D> <#\><{><[>The other th</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> Sorry Trish
<$D> <#\>I was just going to say the other thing with that
book was also you were saying it was a review by Macquarie
University I think didn't you
<$E> <#\>Yes I
<$D> <#\>It was printed by Macquarie University as well, and
I actually spoke with that um lady in the beginning, and she
said that er three thousand copies had been printed in the
first run <#\>They were on a second printing run <#\>So there's
got
to be a reason too for a favourable review if you're going to
sell your second printing run <#\>It can be biased
<$A> <#\>Mm
<$E> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Well it's it's an interesting case <#\>I'd and i it
raises the question of how far the reviewer is reacting to the
phenomenon rather than the book <#\>I mean, i an and perhaps
that's fair enough <#\>Perhaps this is indeed how people react
<#\>Um, but it's not so much reacting to the craft of the book
necessarily
<$E> <#\>No that's true
<$A> <#\>I mean and just just to draw attention to that point
'cause when you are reviewing it, you will be required to,
what you are looking at is is the craft of the book,
<$E> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>not <{><[>whether you like the</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>Not the subject</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>subject or not <O>laugh</O>
<$E> <#\>No, well the bottom line I think was that it was
very self indulgent
<$A> <#\>But again isn't that <{><[>a</[> 
<$E> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Is that a judgement of the person or the style or
the way the book's constructed
<$E> <#\>I mean that's <{><[>it's a bit</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>It sounds like</[></{> 
<$E> <#\>ambiguous really
<$A> <#\>Yeah <,> <#\>It it could be <#\>I mean it sounds
like
a personal judgement
<$E> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>But perhaps it could, that's not to say that writing
can't be self indulgent
<$E> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>Um, on all subjects <O>laugh</O> <#\>Yes <#\>But anyway, just
to make sure one is talking about the book, um and not one's
re one's ac one's reaction to the subject <,> <#\>Ah, now,
<{><[>um,</[> 
<$G> <#\><[>Some</[></{> information about the author
<$A> <#\>Information about the author <#\>That might affect your
willingness to buy <#\>Can you think of a case where it might
have affected your interest in a book
<$G> <#\>Um, not off the top of my head, but just from what
field they they come from <#\>Whether they're an academic or
whether they're <,>
<$A> <#\>Or a a 
<$G> <#\>Well
<$A> <#\>newspaper person
<$G> <#\>Yeah <#\>Well they've they're that ah, Andrew
<?>McGowan</?>, that Praise <#\>I mean, just knowing that he lived
on the streets in in Brisbane <#\>And that's where he gathered
the material to write his book from <#\>I mean
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$G> <#\>would influence your decision rather than if you
knew it was an academic who wrote it and
<$A> <#\>Right
<$G> <#\>made it up
<$A> <#\>And you'd know the substance of the book would would
reflect <{><[>his</[> 
<$G> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>his experience of the subject
<$G> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>What was the book titled
<$G> <#\>Praise
<$A> <#\>Praise <#\>You'll have to explain, I'm afraid I don't
know it
<$G> <#\>Oh, it was just a book that was published recently
<#\>It won the Vogel Award
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>And it's fiction
<$G> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>So i it's a fictional um, projection of
<,> of experience of living in inner Brisbane
<$G> <#\>Yeah <#\>Fic yeah, fictionalised <,>
<$A> <#\>Right
<$G> <#\>I think it's, yeah
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$G> <#\>Based on experience but it's fictionalised
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>Thanks
<$E> <#\>Puzzles of Childhood would be a one that would be
sort of, you'd certainly be influenced by the author
<$A> <#\>Yes if you had a a natural interest in Manning
Clark, <{><[>you'd</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>you would track that down, <{><[>wouldn't you</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>And it was</[></{> it was a it was amazing book actually
<#\>Um, and I you'd sort of, I don't even think you'd stop and
think about the craft because of your reaction to the book
<$A> <#\>To the book <#\>Because it's autobiography
<$E> <#\><{><[>Yes</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>And</[></{> and it it's whole existence is is to tease
out the person
<$E> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$E> <#\>Quite unexpected really <,>
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>Anyway, if you had seen that reviewed, say you
would have responded, what, you'd know it was Manning Clark
<$E> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>But er perhaps the the surprise is is something you
might like to know about <#\>You know, it might add to your
knowledge of Manning Clark if the reviewer sort of emphasised
that there were quite unpredictable things within the biog,
autobiography <#\>'Cause pe some people writing autobiographies
tend to slant them <O>laugh</O> in their own favour <#\>And this this
<{><[>is</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>Mm</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>This is obvious I suppose that you you tell a good
story, a good version of yourself
<$E> <#\>Mm mm
<$A> <#\>So um, if an autobiography is ah is self-revealing
and ah, you know, not too careful about what it reveals, it
would be more interesting
<$E> <#\>It was very sad <#\>Have you read it
<$A> <#\>No
<$E> <#\>Oh, it was, it was a surprise because it was so sad
<#\>Um, quite different to what you'd expect I think
<$A> <#\>Yeah 
<$D> <#\>But that ah info about the author, there was a book
that came out recently called The Granny Killers or The Gra
Granny Killer, you know that chap over at Mosman who
<$B> <#\>Mm
<$D> <#\>who <{><[>murdered</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh yes</[></{> 
<$D> <#\>all those <{><[>elderly ladies</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yes, all those</[></{> ladies
<$D> <#\>And that was actually written I think by two people
who had great forensic experience or something or other in
their backgrounds wh, the review was tremendous on that book
because of the expertise of the authors, as you were saying
<#\>And it really </I>
