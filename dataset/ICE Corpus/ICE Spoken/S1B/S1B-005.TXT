<&>TRANSCRIPTION BEGINS ABOUT 10 MINUTES INTO THE TAPE</&>
<I><$A> <#\>Now the conditions that the transformation of growth
path two should be no more profitable than um pi one takes
<?>form of</?> equation tw- three <#\><?>Alls that</?> there
doing there is putting in the quantities of growth path two using
growth path one prices
<$B> <#\>Why
<$Z> <X><O>laughs</O></X>
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <?>that question</?> <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>I mean what <?>point</?> do you <O>inaudible</O> to
<O>inaudible</O> prices
<$A> <#\>What you
<$A> <#\>What you're saying here's that in growth path one
there's the the prices and the outputs you use <#\>Well the
output combinations that you use are the most profitable <#\>You
can't have any more profitable transformation <#\>So by that
theory e- the quantities you use in growth path two won't be as
profitable
<$B> <#\>Right <#\>OKay <#\>That's <?>great</?>
<$A> <#\>So you just put in the th- values <O>inaudible</O>
<$D> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <?>Yep you're right</?> <#\>It It's
It's just the weak action combination <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah that's that's fine <#\>Yeah
<$D?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><?>Thanks</?> <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>And so yo- it's gotta be less than or equal to the
profit at one <#\>Subtracting equations two from three you get
equation four <#\>And that's where I end <#\>that's where 
Michael takes over
<$C> <#\>What's equation four <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Well the it's just a handy little thing to have
<$C?> <#\>Why
<O>laughter</O>
<$A?> <#\>Michael's gonna take over <O>inaudible</O>
<#\><O>inaudible</O> sit down <#\>You know where we're up to
don't you
<$C> <#\>I know where <#\>Yes but I'm not going to follow your
lead straight off <#\>I'm <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>But you just gonna You gonna have to kind of remember
that for the moment <O>inaudible</O>
<$I> <#\>Uh just um <#\>I'll pick up equation four in the
original text <#\>That's equation um
<$?> <#\>Four point ten
<$B> <#\>Point nine <#\>Oh ten <O>inaudible</O>
<$I> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <#\>Um the point I Why I just bring
your attention to the original text is to remind you that we're
not looking <O>inaudible</O> scale <O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <O>anthropophonic</O>
<$I> <#\>Uh <O>inaudible</O> <#\>That's why the text's got the
<$C> <#\>Yeah I
<$I> <#\>It's easier with the text <#\>It's the um um things are
<?>being multiplied by the vectors</?>
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O> by
<$?> <#\>Yes
<$I> <#\>And a lot of what's going to happen after this equation
whether it's done now or not er is reducing those vectors down
to scale by <O>inaudible</O> <?>aggregation</?> <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$C?> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\><?>But</?> we've kind of divided this up that I mainly
concentrate on marginal product of labour and Matt concentrates
on marginal products of capital <#\>But in a sort of
<O>inaudible</O> in addition to that each <#\>So um I'll just go
through what I've done here <#\>And I mean the question that
we're asked <?>was was was</?> what do we mean or could mean
<#\>And by the way I haven't just concentrated on on <?>on at
least</?> in the beginning <#\>I I've just gone through a
rationale or or some sort of historical um presentation of of
marginal product of simple marginal product <#\>Um and the
question was what do we mean or could mean by the marginal
products as a factor of production <#\>Um how we define marginal
product uh can't be explained without dealing with a significant
<?>segment on this theory</?> <#\>Um because this provides us
with a reason for worrying about it at all <#\>And Harcourt gives
us the um <O>inaudible</O> this uh fourth parable in his uh paper
there <#\>And it's the competitive condition that distribution
of income between profit receivers and wage-earners can be
explained by a knowledge of marginal products and and <?>back
to</?> supplies <#\>Um OKay central to this parable is the belief
that marginal products as factors are able to be calculated and
that these uh equal to the returns of each factor in equilibrium
<#\>Uh the marginal product of a factor being the variation in
total output which results when the quantity of factors increase
by an infinitesimally small amount while all other things are
hels constant
     
     <&>TRANSCRIPTION SUSPENDED AND RESUMES ABOUT 15 MINUTES
     BEFORE THE END OF THE TAPE (SOON AFTER A 10 SECOND PAUSE)
     TO CATCH MORE INTERACTION</&>

<$C> <#\>But what it basically is is that um he tries to he
establishes the um necessary conditions for um marginal net value
of the product to be equal to price level <#\>Now um it doesn't
That's what it should say up the top there somewhere but it it
doesn't <#\>Um OKay then now he uses a general approach to to um
do this <#\>Um <?>that</?> a firm <?>had</?> two plans <#\>One
profit maximising one output was produced uh and labour's the
only non-produced input <O>inaudible</O> um <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>Um there uh the present in- the present value added yeah
present value of a unit of output is P nought present cost of a
unit of labour is P L um present value of cost of a unit of
capital services in one period um <O>inaudible</O> <?>delta</?>
<O>inaudible</O> price vector Q uh and is determined by the level
of demand for services of that unit of capital the interest rate
which is constant here and capital <?>br-</?> depreciation over
the plan period <#\>Uh so <?>that</?> we're saying that
<O>inaudible</O> this firm's got two two plans one with profit
maximisation and it's a <?>choice of</?> choosing between the two
<#\>Uh
<$B> <#\>So what's the other plan
<$C> <#\>The other The other plan i- i- i- is just an alternative
plan as opposed to a profit maximisation plan
<$I> <#\>Same Same technique <O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Yeah <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>Um the output levels is is zero and capital input inputs
vector equals K <#\>Um employment level is L <#\>Um now um the
present value of profit for the maximisation plan
<O>inaudible</O> um has to exceed that of the other plan <#\>And
so we get that uh profit inequality there <#\>Uh
<$B> <#\>Is your O here sort of like O as in the amount zero
<$C> <#\>Sorry
<$B> <#\>O is O not zero
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>O is O is output there
<$?> <#\>Oh <O>laughs</O>
<$C> <#\>Although there are some uh <#\>I I do have those zeros
around the place so I guess you'd have to be careful of that
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>I mean where there's
<$B> <#\>Yeah <O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>The fact that O's equal to zero
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>Where there Where there's uh
<$D> <#\><?>That's with</?> output
<$E> <#\>Zeros <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>I can see that
<$?> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>See zero is by itself <#\>It does- It doesn't
have um a delta or a one attached to it or a two attached or
anything like that <?>or one</?>
<$?> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>So zero is just by itself <#\>OKay <#\>Uh so we have
that e- that in- inequality at the top of the page therefore um
<$F> <#\>Should that be O one on the next line <O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> P O one
<$F> <#\>Delta
<$E> <#\><?>Therefore</?> delta O er delta delta
<$F> <#\>The
<$B> <#\>No <#\><?>It's just an O</?>
<$?> <#\>Delta is O two one <?>zero</?>
<$F> <#\>Oh that's right <#\>Yeah
<$C?> <#\>Yeah it it it
<$F> <#\>Oh OKay <#\>Yep <#\>That's OKay
<$C> <#\>Yeah if we we we change that it that we we take uh uh
so that it's from the point of view of um maximiser um we take
we we subtract the um one plan from the other so that your
differences in output um capital and labour
<$B> <O>laughs</O>
<$C> <#\>Um and uh <#\>That should just be delta delta L <#\>Um
dividing right through we can get an equation um uh a a an ine-
inequality in terms of um the price of labour <#\>Um <#\>OKay
<#\>So that uh <#\>Now the the first term in that is um very
similar to um the marginal product the net value marginal product
<O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><?>Mike</?>  can I just ask what are <O>inaudible</O>
delta L <#\>I mean I can sort of see the first one looks sort of
like the one above <#\>But are we divide to get the inequality
<O>inaudible</O> divide by delta L
<$C> <#\>Yo-
<$C> <#\>Um you divide the whole equation by delta L
<$B> <#\>Which whole equation
<$C> <#\>Um I should've numbered these <#\>I know <#\>I'm sorry
<#\>Um the second equation from the top
<$B> <#\>Tha- That I mean <?>s'posed to</?> equal to zero
<#\><?>How</?> <#\>I mean have you taken things out of the other
side
<$C> <#\>Yes <#\>Because you've got that
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> a lot more terms than that
<O>inaudible</O> <?>there is</?> in the first
<$C> <#\>Okay
<$?> <#\>Just wait
<$B> <#\>OKay shut up
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>No that's a that's a alright <#\>I mean it has it's it's
been um um the left-hand equation <O>inaudible</O> equation the
left- the left-hand equation has been taken over to the right-
hand side <#\>And um
<$B> <#\>I'm I'm fine up to less than or equal to P L one <#\>I'm
not sure how you got
<$G> <#\>You divide by
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Oh you're down
<$G> <#\>You divide by delta L and if delta L is <?>virtually</?>
nought <?>you have to</?>
<$C> <#\><?>Hang on</?> <O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>Oh I <?>see</?>
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$G> <#\>No <#\>The second clause where delta L is
<?>virtually</?> nought where the inequality <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Oh I see
<$B> <#\>So you're taking two cases
<$C?> <#\>That's right
<$C?> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Oh OKay
<$C?> <#\>It's a It's a <#\>It all derives from the fact that you
if you've remembered the the graph the it
<$B> <#\>Oh I see
<$E> <#\><?>Sorry</?>
<$E> <#\>I don't
<O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Well <O>inaudible</O> when you divide by by a number
<?>if</?> it's negative you change the inequality
<O>inaudible</O>
<$F?> <#\>Yeah
<$E> <#\>We're looking at the We're looking at the third line
aren't we
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$F> <#\>Yeah
<$E> <#\>Yeah <#\>Oh OKay so we you got two separate inequalities
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>The first ones in the case where delta is
positive
<$E> <#\>Depending on what <#\>And then the value of P L one
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$E> <#\>Oh
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> like I mean <O>inaudible</O> add one
it'll change
<$E> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$F> <#\>Yeah
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\><?>Still</?>
<$E> <#\>Messy isn't it
<$B> <#\>It is <#\>It is
<$C?> <#\>That's uh I mean I'm having to read it why shouldn't
you
<O>laughter</O>
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O> It's not your fault
<$F> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>No <#\>No
<$C> <#\>Um <#\>Yeah <#\>It er If you just e- If you think back
to the um to the the graph and where it wasn't well-defined the
slope was different on one side than it was on the other
<$E> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>And so this is what it's attempting to point out that
you know sort of if you subtract a small amount of labour that
it mightn't be the same as if you increase um by a small amount
of labour which i- is what uh um traditional economics you know
sort of they're both the same <#\>Um
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>OKay so you have <O>inaudible</O> as a marginal product-
like term on both sides of the the inequality
<$F> <#\>Marginal product-like term <#\>Interesting
<$C> <#\>Well at the at the beginning <#\>And And then you have
you have another term there um which i- is um Q one delta K by
one on one on delta L <#\>Now uh
<$B> <#\><?>Taking</?> the first one like a marginal product
<$C> <#\>Uh
<$B> <#\><?>See</?> P zero one times delta X <O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Well it's not quite <#\>Uh but it's not the marginal
product at all unless that's able uh delta L is able to go to
zero
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>So it's not quite
<$E> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>It It add <#\>It's not It's not the marginal
product as such yeah <#\>But But if you um that that term Q one
delta K there um in that circumstance where delta K equals zero
that's equivalent to saying that all other inputs are held
constant which is like the traditional mode and then those terms
go become zero <#\>And it it's um <#\>That's the necessary
condition for the traditional mar- or simple marginal product
case <#\>Uh now if it's not just delta K that e- e- equals zero
i- it's it's Q one delta K
<$F> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>And Q one Q one delta K is the difference in total total
cost of um um the value of uh the capital services at the present
value uh between the alternative plan <#\>If that is constant
between between plans um then that is the necessary condition for
the marginal net value product <#\>So that in
<$H> <#\><O>inaudible</O> call that the general case assumption
<$C> <#\>Well it's a more of a general case
<$H> <#\><O>inaudible</O> you having other inputs
<O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Um that's right yeah so
<$H> <#\><O>inaudible</O> really not necessary possibly
<$C> <#\>That's right <#\>And so that we we get a situation
<#\>And I I've uh And this is is um the way that he's set it out
um
<O>cough</O>
<$C> <#\>So you notice the subscripts there you you have um P
nought one multiplied by delta nought on on delta L <#\>Um the
subscripts for the first um term uh delta L is greater than zero
<#\>Delta K is equal to zero <#\>OKay <#\>Um greater than equals
is that situation where delta L is greater than zero <#\>Q one
delta K is equal to zero <#\>Now um that is that second term is
greater than the first term for the reason that we pointed out
before and and as Mal said that um that there are even though
there is a restriction on these that um it capital is able to
vary some degree</I>
