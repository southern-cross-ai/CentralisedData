<I><$A> <#\>Some of these others<,> that you are now claiming as
addictive behaviour we don't understand so well <#\>Perhaps
somebody else would just like to tell me about<,>
<$B> <#\>Yes Peter <#\>Um<,,> I joined Coda when<,> um I had taken on
the responsibility of looking after my<,> my aged mother
<#\>She'd developed um<,> dementia<,> wandering dementia and she
we she wasn't sick enough to go into a nursing home and so I
was<,> I was left with with her <#\>I couldn't see any other
solution than to bring her home to be with me <#\>She'd been in
a<,> a psychiatric unit<,> for two months and um<,> I ah<,,>
completely lost my identity <#\>I gave over my<,> career I gave
up my career <#\>I'm a<,> psychotherapist and body worker and
ah<,> yoga teacher and I'd had to surrender<,> my yoga studio
and my career to<,> look after my mother and um<,> I don't
regret doing it for one moment because I learned so much<,>
about myself and about my relationship with my mother <#\>It
developed me beyond<,> um<,,> you know the human level
<$A> <#\>But it's a very charitable and<,> commendable thing to do
ah<,> <{><[>devoting yourself to <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yes <#\>But I<,,> I lost</[></{> my identity that was the problem
and I didn't know where to turn to<,,> <#\>So I w was told about
co-dependence<,> anonymous<,,> at Neutral Bay and I<,> went
there for<,> support and um<,> and that's ah<,,> you know it
helped me tremendously
<$A> <#\>Well perhaps you'll just explain for me now<,> what it is
in the problems that you've<,> described here<,> that makes
you co-dependent<,,>
<$C> <#\>It's where you use<,> something<,> or some one<,> to make
your own reality bearable<,,> So for instance<,> rather than
acknowledge<,,> the true emotion that you may be having<,> it
may be anger sadness whatever<,,> you might use food<,,> or
you might um<,,> use a relationship that you're in<,> um I
mean how many of us<,,> spend a lot of time sitting in our
partner's laps<,,> um when really we'd actually like to be
doing something else but we can't think of another way to
make<,> the current reality more<,> OK
<$A> <#\>But aren't you really talking about wanting to be more
independent
<$C> <#\>We are <{><[>and</[> that's what co-dependence<,> that's what
coming out of co-dependency's about <#\>It's being<,,> about
claiming yourself again<,> being<,> being honest about how it
is for you um<,> and not using other people to make that
easier
<$A> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
     Yes <#\>But it seems to me you're really describing<,>
dependent behaviour aren't you I mean you're you you<,> <#\>Mark
was dependent on gambling um<,,> <#\>Peter was<,> dependent on
his<,> wife um<,,> <#\>You lost Jan lost her identity because she
was looking aft aren't you really just describing<,> straight
dependence<,> on some other person<,> some other thing
<$D> <#\>Yes <#\>I think I was addicted to being that angry addiction
that you talked about and um <{><[>one of the really</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So you were a rage addict</[></{> were you <O>laughter</O>
<$D> <#\>Yes <#\>And what I realised was that I was proje projecting
that out on my partner<,> or<,> my children and<,,> so for me
it's that<,> I want to own my own<,> I want to<,> to be in
contact with<,> what it is that caused me to be<,> very angry
way way back<,> and I have found that<,,> um <#\>Basically I was
I was addicted to being a special child and then I was
replaced by another one<,,> and<,> instead of projecting that
out<,> I I<,> want to heal that<,,> and um
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\>Mark<,> what is it in<,> your problem that you
described for us that makes you<,> co-dependent<,>
<$E> <#\>Well<,,> basically I<,,> I handed over my power to to
other people <#\>What I what I needed basically<,> was an
antidote <#\>I had two<,> fundamental things <#\>I had a fear of
aloneness<,> I developed that as a<,> as a child and a fear
of rejection and abandonment<,,> and my<,,> antidote was
gambling <#\>So<,,> it's like having that<,> consciousness<,> of
gratification outside and I would sort of<,> pluck the
providden ah forbidden fruit and I would take that and that
would squash my emotions <#\>I didn't want to<,> get in contact
with intimacy <#\>I didn't want to be in contact with
vulnerability <#\>I found that very difficult as a male <#\>We<,>
had<,,> this<,> you know you've got your peer group around
you<,> acting out certain things and I was I was a part of
that<,> and I didn't want to be seen<,> as a as a vulnerable
person and I and this is one of the things I'm still<,,>
learning a lot about <#\>So I took the antidote<,> and every time
I<,> the pain would come up I would take another antidote and
it wouldn't matter whether it was gambling<,,> um <#\>When I came
out of the gambling cycle<,,> then I<,> I looked I hooked into
something else<,> so<,> what I have to do is to really monitor
my behaviour and look at that in in very specifically
<$A> <#\>But couldn't you've just gone along to gamblers
anonymous<,,> <{1><[1>and</[1> dealt with the gambling problem <#\><{2><[2>I
mean</[2> 
<$E> <#\><[1>Ah ah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>And I</[2></{2> and I<,> you know<,,> that was that was the
opportunity and I that was an opportunity I took up<,> about
twenty years ago<,> and then you get backed hooked hooked back
into the cycle until I dealt with my emotions<,> until I dealt
with my inner child<,,> until I looked at my family of origin
and how that worked<,,> then<,> I need information <#\>Once I
have information then I can<,,> do something with it <#\>Without
that crucible of information I I I had nothing
<$A> <#\>Now this is what intrigued me because a lot of you talk
about the inner child<,,> <#\>What's the inner child <#\>And what
are we dealing with here <#\>Lorraine
<$Z> <X><#\><#\>Um<,> to me the inner child is just an energy within<,>
that that comes up you know if you're excited or happy about
something<,> that's your little child coming up <#\>Um<,>  you
functional adult is the one that carries on all day and is
business-like and professional and we all have different parts
that come up<,> but often we have that inner child that's been
very hurt and wounded as a child<,,> and you need to get it
bring it up and look at it and and<,> be there for it and make
it feel secure</X>
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>So what is it in your problems that makes you co-
dependent do you think
<$Z> <X><#\><#\>Well I I grew up in a a<,> family where<,> we weren't
allowed feelings<,,> and<,> if we were angry you were sent to
your room um<,> and so I've learnt to<,> medicate my feelings
<#\>I never knew how to deal with them<,,> and it and<,,> co-
dependents do anything<,> but feel the feelings<,,> <#\>And it
when you let one<,> you you said why did Mark's you know why
wasn't gamblers enough well<,> if you let go one addiction
you'll bring up another <#\>You know when I let go my workaholism
my<,> eating came up<,> and I had to go into OA and start
dealing with my eating<,> until I could learn</X>
<$A> <#\>So you've been in overeaters anonymous
<$Z> <X><#\><#\>As well yes <#\>Until I could learn to<,,> let the feelings
come up<,> and deal with them<,> and now I can but<,> when<,>
you've never dealt with the feelings it's just so frightening
and so painful</X>
<$A> <#\>So how are you dealing with them
<$Z> <X><#\><#\>By by talk owning them<,> by talking about them at
meetings<,> and be be before<,> I'd<,> when I use to stuff
them<,> I I'd carry an anger around for months years<,> a
resentment<,> whereas now I'll go to a meeting and I'll say
"so and so's happened and I'm so angry and I'm furious about
it"<,> and it just<,> you know by the time the meeting's over
that anger's <{><[><,> dissipated</[> <#\>Yep</X>
<$A> <#\><[>So you get it all out</[></{> 
     <#\>Now look I wanna find out what goes on at these meetings
in just a moment but I I I I'd like to just perhaps get a
specific definition of co-dependency so that I can understand
exactly<,> what the word means 'cos it is a bit confusing<,,>
I think<,> because co-dependency to me has always been<,> well
well didn't it in fact begin as a description for<,> the
families of alcoholics<,> <#\>Ah<,,> spouse or partner of an
alcoholic was considered to be co-dependent <#\>And now you're
using it in a very different sort of way <O>inaudible</O><,,>
how would you<,,> define<,,> co-dependence<,,> for me
<$Y> <X><#\><#\>It did start as um<,,> being a partner of alcoholic and
drug addicts<,> and it really went beyond that description
because it became evident that some people had those
characteristics before<,> without any<,,> ah alcoholic in the
family of origin or being in a relationship with alcoholic
<#\>There are is quite a lot of co-dependence without any
reference to alcoholism <{1><[1><,></[1> these days<,> <#\>Or some
<{2><[2>people</[2> </X>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
    <#\><[2>But you still</[2></{2> haven't given me a definition of co-
dependence
<$Y> <X><#\><#\>Now let me finish it <#\>It's very it's very complicated <#\>My
definition of co-dependency is um<,,> ah<,> the condition ah
um that one has as a as a result of um um<,> disowning<,> the
real the authentic self and being replaced by<,> adopted or
expected self<,> <#\>In other words in a family of origin<,> when
a child is growing up and cannot be who he is<,,> and has
to<,,> ah submerge that and try to be somebody that is
expected of him <#\>That is the split between the real self and </X>
<$A> <#\>Trying to be somebody else<,,> <#\>How would I tell me<,>
how would I know if I was co-dependent<,> <#\>Am I co-dependent
<O>laughter</O> <#\>No <#\>Tell me <#\>How would I know if I was co-
dependent
<$?> <#\>You can start identifying tonight <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>No <#\>Tell me <#\>What should I look for<,>
<$F> <#\>Peter<,> I'd like to come in here<,,> <#\>Ah<,> I think
there's a great mistake in talking of a co-dependent <{><[><,,></[> 
<#\>Most people have some co-dependent behaviour<,,> some of which
is positive<,> some is destructive for them<,,> and some<,>
they want to keep others they want to get rid of
<$A> <#\><[>Right<,,></[></{> 
     <#\>So what is this<,,> <#\>You see I'm serious <#\>How <{><[>would</[> I
know if I was co-dependent or not
<$F> <#\><[>OK</[></{> 
     <#\>The interesting thing to me is when I work with co-
dependents <#\>You start reading the books and there are <{1><[1><,,></[1> 
many many now <#\>You can have a whole book<,> without a concise
definition<,,> and<,,> I've<,,> leafed through them to to
form<,,> you know to be able to come up with a definition this
size <{2><[2><,></[2> and there are books written where<,> it's not
defined <#\>To me<,,> the closest I can come to it is<,,> a co-
dependent person<,> wel no whoops <O>laughter</O> a person
with co-dependent behaviour<,,> is one who<,> either stays in
relationships<,,> they don't want to be in and are destructive
for them<,> because they're too scared of getting out of
them<,,> or will never allow themselves to be close enough to
have a relationship because they're too afraid of the pains
and things involved with it<,,> <#\>Ah<,> it's a person who<,,>
has behaviour very often<,,> that is compulsive<,,> which
avoids<,> other pains and behaviours<,> and it's a person<,>
who's had some sort of damage in their childhood <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>And
it's as wide as that
<$A> <#\><[1>Dozens</[1> </{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3> 
     <#\>Yes <#\>I I I I it is obviously very broad and we're going
to finish this program without a clear definition I can see<,>
but I'm really just trying to draw the <{><[>threads</[> of all the
experiences that I've heard here<,> to<,,> just try and
understand<,> exactly what ah<,,> co-dependency is all about
<$F> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$G> <#\>It's to do with balance<,> <#\>If your life's out of
balance<,> like Lorraine said<,> I grew up<,> my mum was one
of the first AA women<,> and I went for over thirty years<,,>
not knowing that I was co-dependent but<,> acting out all the
time<,,> looking for this love that I didn't get because I was
a child<,> who was what they call empowered <#\>I became the
little mother<,> in our family<,,> and then I went on to try
and rescue everybody<,,> and today that's a different pattern
now<,> but<,> can you see <{><[>it's that</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yes <#\>I can</[></{> but I<,> I I I am just wondering here<,> if
you think about yourself enough<,> couldn't we all persuade
ourselves that we were co-dependent <{1><[1><,></[1> you see <#\>Well I'm
interested in Camilla's experience because now Camilla went
along to one of the self help groups basically just to<,> hold
the hand of a friend didn't you<,> <#\>You sat in on one or
<{2><[2>two</[2> of these groups and then came away absolutely convinced
that you are ah<,> hopelessly co-dependent yourself
<$G> <#\><[1>No</[1></{1> 
<$H> <#\><[2>Yes</[2> </{2>
     <#\>Yes<,> yes <#\>That's true <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Now are you sure you didn't just talk yourself into that
<$H> <#\>No no no <#\>I didn't <#\>No <#\>Um<,,> I I'd been in counselling
for<,,> at least six months before I w went to<,> because my
my marriage was<,,> very unst  unhealthy  <,> and ah was coming
unstuck<,,> and um I I just fell into to a Coda group <#\>That's
true <#\>And<,,> I<,> I  I   had no idea I was so disconnected from
myself<,> but after working for a few years I've now<,> come
into contact to with what I call my spirituality<,> which is a
new area of my self that I  I  <,> know I was connected to as a
very very little child<,> and became very disconnected from<,>
<{><[>and that's</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So you</[></{> basically now just feel better about yourself
<$H> <#\>I  I   well yes <#\>I  I   now <#\>Yes <#\>I feel alive <#\>I've been half alive <#\>I've literally been limping<,> all my life but I wasn't
aware of it<,,> at all <#\>No <#\>I wasn't 
<$A> <#\>So what happens in these groups<,> <#\>What happens in the
groups that produces the sort of result you've<,> described
for us Camilla<,>
<$B> <#\>The groups are very supportive ah Peter <{><[>You're ab</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So what</[></{> happens <#\>Do you all just sit around and <{><[><,></[> 
discuss your problems
<$B> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
     <#\>Yes <#\>And and we're not allowed to ah interrupt<,,> and
ah<,> and you you just feel<,,> all those eyes mirroring
back<,,> at you validating<,> what you are saying and your
feelings<,,> <#\>And validation is um<,,> ah<,> just a form of
love a form of spirituality
<$A> <#\>So if you've got a problem<,,> you simply go along to one
of these groups <#\>You sit around in a group<,> and each person
in turn<,,> just<,> talks about  talks about   their problem <#\>So
you're really just you're really just articulating your
problem<,> each of you
<$?> <#\><{><[>It may not <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$E> <#\><[>Peter<,> it really ah<,></[> </{>for me it really is about<,>
being in a group like that is really about being in a safe<,>
non-judgmental environment <#\>You go out into the world<,> and
people are making judgments <#\>There may be judgments within the
room<,> and they are not expressed<,,> so that people are able
to sit there and<,> and really just express the way they're
feeling<,> at the moment<,> and it doesn't matter what stage
of the program<,> they're in<,> there is always support there</I>
