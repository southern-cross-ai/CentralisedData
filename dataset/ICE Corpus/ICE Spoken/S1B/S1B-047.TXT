<S1B-047> <2016>
<I><$A> <#\>First of all Penny thanks for joining us <#\>I have to
ask
you<,> why Nicaragua
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>Not a common choice <#\>Ah it was purely by
chance <#\>Ah
I went to<,> Nicaragua for the first time in nineteen eighty
five<,> as a free lance reporter<,> to cover an international
peace march <#\>I was so shocked and amazed by what I saw there
that I thought<quote> Oh I wanna come back and have another look<,>
and I wanna come back here and work</quote> so<,> at the end of
nineteen eighty six<,> I did that <#\>I thought I was just gonna
go and<,> teach a bit of radio<,> make a few radio programs<,>
and then<,,> get the hell out of there I guess but<,> after
about<,,> oh two or three months I thought<quote> Wow if I really
wanna know what's going on here I'm gonna have to stick around
for quite some time</quote>
<$A> <#\>Oh<,> just get back to your first visit <#\>What did you
see
there <#\>I mean did you see something very romantic<,> <#\>The
Sandalista Revolution<,> amongst some circles in the West was
quite a romantic one wasn't it
<$B> <#\>Well it was romantic in the sense that ah it literally
was<,> a bunch of young<,> men and women who<,,> fought a
guerilla war up in the mountains<,,> who defeated a
dictator<,> that had been backed very strongly<,> by the
United States<,,> and in that part of the world that doesn't
happen very often<,,> and so<,> I think people sort of
thought<quote> wow</quote> you know <#\>It was a real David and Goliath sort
of<,> story <#\>What did I see <#\>I saw the most amazing
poverty<,> <#\>Houses made out of cardboard and plastic
<#\>People
with threadbare clothes<,> <#\>Long queues at shopping centres
or
supermarkets<,> <#\>But<,> what really caught my attention was
that<,,> people weren't<,> in any way<,> resigned to this
poverty nor were they saying you know<quote> poor me</quote> like<quote> isn't
this a terrible situation</quote> <#\>People were saying<quote> well<,> you
know<,> we want better than this <#\>We actually want decent
houses <#\>We want our kids to go to schools <#\>We want land to
farm</quote> and the Sandalistas are<,> you know what they're about
is getting that kind of stuff <#\>Now<,> you might think well
what's that got to do with a<,> white middle class Australian
<#\>Why <O>Blaughing</O> <#\>Why would I be so enthused with<,,>
um
something that was happening in a far off country<,> a hot
sort of jungle war zone <#\>But<,,> I think the thing that was
so
exciting about Nicaragua was that<,> the Sandalistas said
<quote>yes<,> <#\>This is<,> a social revolution that is about the
poverty in the Third World<,,> but it's about<,> how the
poverty in the Third World is related<,> to your lives in the
First World<,> and we want you<,> to come here and watch
what's happening<,> and<,> if you want to<,> we want you to
come back and participate</quote> <#\>Now<,> that hasn't happened many
times<,> in history<,> and<,,> it was a very exciting kind of
challenge because<,> as you say it's very easy to be romantic
about<,,> revolutionary peasants with guns in their hands
shouting slogans <#\>It's much<,> harder if you like<,> to stick
around and<,> see what exactly it is they're chanting about
and what they do<,> after the rally's over if you like<,>
after the crowd has gone home <#\>How do people live and<,,> how
does the way you live<,,> affect<,> the way they live
<$A> <#\>Mmm well the book certainly gives us a a great picture
of
the day to day lives of people during the revolution trying to
rebuild the country<,> but it also gives us this<,> this great
picture of<,> of Westerners coming in<,> with their<,> great
liberal minds<,> to to<,> help the revolution almost lead it
on <#\>And what was that like<,> being there as a Westerner
yourself and seeing that
<$B> <#\>Well<,,> as I say early in the book when I first went
I
thought I thought<quote> well<,> I'm a journalist <#\>I'm not like
that</quote> you know<,> I<,> was under this illusion for perhaps oh
I dunno twelve hours because<,> the Nicaraguans made it very
clear to me that no matter what I thought about myself<,> I
was clearly<,> one of the many thousands of foreigners who'd
arrived in their country <#\>Very simple things made us<,> all
sort of lump together very easily <#\>For example<,,> in the West
to<,> wear sort of different clothes<,> to not brush your hair
to say not shave your underarms<,> is a statement that<,> you
as an individual<,> are more important than what you look
like <#\>In Nicaragua people were very careful about how they
dressed <#\>No matter how poor some one was they wouldn't
think<,> of leaving the house to go out in public<,> without
washing their clothes ironing them and looking<,> as
presentable as they could so again<,> if you wandered along
the streets you'd often see scruffy foreigners in<,> ah
sandals<,> hence the term Sandalistas<,> and pretty kinda
shabby old singlets and shorts and so on<,,> and<,> you'd see
Nicaraguans sort of looking a bit askance at them thinking<,>
<quote>oh god what's wrong with them <#\>Don't they have the money
to<,> to buy proper clothes</quote> <#\>The other things that lumped us
all together as you said earlier was that<,> we all came to
Nicaragua I think<,> expecting that<,> we could contribute to
what was going on there<,> and that we had really good ideas
about how to change the world<,,> even<,> if those ideas were
nothing more than thinking that because we had an education<,>
and because we know how to plan and<,> organise ourselves and
set goals<,,> that that would be<,> helpful <#\>The process of
social change isn't like that <#\>You might be able to analyse
very quickly what's wrong with a place<,> but that doesn't
really matter <#\>Unless you're prepared to stick around and work
with people<,> who have to lift those problems<,> and who have
to live with the consequences of you trying to solve their
problems then<,,> really you're not contributing very much
<#\>It's very important for foreigners to<,,> be critical of
their<,> of what<,> what we did there for me to be critical
about what I did <#\>You have to learn<,> how to how to be
productive <#\>You have to<,> leave aside<,> really<,> a whole
lot of<,,> expectations that you have<,> and just be prepared
to work within<,> a system that is very different than your
own
<$A> <#\>Mmm but teaching radio to<,> women in the hills is a
fairly insignificant thing when we<,> listen back to<,> the
the part of the program that you've produced today that<,>
that you know<,> suggests<,> that<,,> that the solution to the
new world order is in fact just to<,> redistribute the
wealth<,> get rid of foreign debt<,> you know<,> distribute
food and resources more fairly<,> and then<,> of course there
wouldn't be any need to travel off to the Third World to to
teach radio to women in the Hills <#\>I mean what good does it
do
them<,,>
<$B> <#\>The problems are only there in the Third World because
we
in the First World are the problem <#\>We are the problem because
we take so much of the world's resources<,> and<,> when in
Third World countries<,> we see people without<,> radios for
example<,> we don't think<quote> oh that's because<,,> I have six
transistors<,> in my home and three televisions and<,> perhaps
a a video recorder</quote> <#\>We don't make that connection <#\>We
should<,,> but we don't <#\>I did find it much easier to be
teaching radio<,> to women<,,> and and other students in
Nicaragua because<,> they were so pleased that I was there
<#\>They were very grateful all the time <#\>They kept saying
<quote>isn't
it wonderful you've come</quote> and it became<,> if you like very
easy to be<,,> a hero if you like in some one else's
country<,,> but<,> I have to keep in mind that when I come
back to Australia I find it much more difficult<,> to talk to
my friends and colleagues<,,> about the things I learnt about
cultural politics in Nicaragua
<$A> <#\>Mmm well I mean just what you're describing there about
being the hero coming to teach<,> radio to the Sandalistas
is<,> is almost reinforcing<,> the relationship between the
First World and the Third World <#\>We go to save them <#\>How
can
you be sure that you're part of the solution and not the
problem
<$B> <#\>Again a very difficult question <#\>It's very hard to
change
the system <#\>It's very hard to<,> do foreign aid in a way<,>
that isn't<,> basically reproducing the inequities <#\>I think
I
go back to how<,> I originally got into all this if you
like<,> and that was in nineteen eighty six when<,,> this<,>
Bengali feminist<,,> <O>inaudible</O> came to Australia<,> and
we talked about cultural politics<,,> and she described how
she was always teaching white middle class boys<,> or men in
her class<,> who were feeling sorry that they were the
oppressors<,,> and they were wanting her to teach them all
about feminism and Third World politics<,> so that they would
not<,> go on<,> contributing<,> to this oppression and she
told this very<,,> funny story about how one day she just said
to them<quote> why don't you develop a sense of rage<,> about the
position that you have been given in history <#\>Why don't you
get angry <#\>Why don't you<,> learn about why it is<,> that you
are in this position <#\>And once you've learnt about it<,> then
you will understand what you can do<,,> to make a difference</quote>
<#\>It's particularly important at this historical moment that
Westerners that white middle class women like myself<,> learn
why it is<,> that we are in this position of privilege<,> that
we have so many choices<,,> and once we learn that<,> once we
can say<quote> we have these privileges because of this and this and
this <#\>We understand what that privilege means and how that
denies other people privilege</quote><,> then we can set about<,>
contributing to the process of social change<,> in a way that
isn't just<,> reinforcing things as they've always been <#\>I
don't say that because<,> I want people to feel guilty
<#\>There's nothing to do with guilt<,> in this issue <#\>It's
a
question of<,> being clear about how the world is
structured<,> who's got the resources and why<,> and what
you're gonna do<,> about<,,> changing that
<$A> <#\>Have you seen many changes since you returned to
Australia in terms of<,> the number of women in particular<,>
who<,,> are perhaps there with you now or<,> or is it a fairly
isolated experience<,,>
<$B> <#\>It's isolated if you don't look for the connections
<#\>If
you look for the links<,> as you heard in this program<,>
there are so many women out there<,> who are doing so many
incredible jobs
<$A> <#\>Mmm it's not their jobs that I'm so concerned about I
guess <#\>It's their consciousness<,> I mean I'm<,> concerned
<#\>There's<,> a lot of people that've gone to the Third World<,>
done<,> what we would say are fairly worthwhile projects<,>
and come back<,,> being unchanged<,,>
<$B> <#\>I don't think they're unchanged<,> <#\>You can't go<,>
into
those situations and be unchanged <#\>You can go<,> and not be
self critical <#\>That's a different thing <#\>Yes <#\>That
happens a
lot <#\>It's up to those who have<,> a consciousness to talk
about it<,,> and<,> I think<,> you have to encourage people<,>
to go<,> because it's only in the going<,> it's only in the
confrontation<,,> it's only when<,> the two world's<,> meet<,>
and and clash<,,> that you get<,> an interest and a
discussion <#\>If we all sat here in Australia<,> very happy with
the way<,> we're living our lives<,> we wouldn't have the
opportunity<,> to learn those things and nor would we have the
opportunity<,> to<,> spend time<,,> with an amazing range of
women who are doing the most amazing work<,> in other parts of
the world<,> so<,> I guess you know<,> get out there
<$A> <#\>I'm sorry <#\>I can't let you off the hook on that one
<#\>I'm
sure there's a lot of people who'd say you just have to travel
a few hundred miles<,> north to the nearest Aboriginal
settlement and you'd<,> have that very same clash<,,></I>
