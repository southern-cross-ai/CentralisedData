<I><$A>   <#\>All right um section fifty one thirty five<,,>
<#\>Do we remember what that is um<,,> <#\>The the
questone of the tutorial questions  is how has
the the  um<,> federal constitution limited
the powers of state<,> in industrial relations<,,> um<,> or
how has it limited the federal government<,> or what can they
do <#\>Um<,> all right <#\>Section fifty one thirty five is
the the  um power in the constitution<,>
that enables<,> the federal government<,> to legislate in the
areas of prevention and settlement of industrial disputes
extending beyond the limits of any one state<,,> um<,,>
<#\>You all aware of that<,,> <O>coughing in background</O>
<O>inaudible</O> um<,,> <#\>Fifty one thirty five <#\>We've
got to look at<,,> <#\>Historically when the<,>
when we  um<,> looked at the development of
arbitration um we looked at the fact that it was set up<,> in
answer to<,> the the  industrial strife of
the eighteen nineties<,> um and<,,> it was used as a<,> you
know sort of a a<,> a  response and a deal
between different sorts of groups um<,,> coming together
andand  you know we had the the the  liberal um<,,> <#\>How can I do this thing
<O>laughter</O> the the er liberal politicians
and middle class sort of coming to ato
agreement  with the trade unions that<,>
that  they would set up um<,> or<,> agree to go into
a<,> a  system of compulsory arbitration
<#\>Now<,> the wording of the constitution specifically says
and<,> limited the power of the federalfederal  parliament<,> by saying that they could
only intervene into  prevent the federal
disputes extending beyond the limits of one state <#\>The the state governmentthe states  got more
power <#\>You know um<,> as we saw you know we<,>
when<,> when  it was set up<,> we had the<,> the  colonies<,,> sort of<,> protecting
their <w>states'</w> rights so<,> the states have<,> more
power in industrial relations than what the feds have <#\>So
the key<,> key  words inin  the constitution we're looking at are
industrial disputes and the interstateness required  <#\>Now
in order to settle those<,> in order  to
get<,> a<,> matter heard<,,> or jurisdiction in the federal
commission we've got to satisfy<,> an industrial dispute and an in an inand an interstate  <#\>We've got
to satisfy those requirements
<$B> <#\>So it's gotta be both<,> <#\><{><[>Like it</[> like it it  can't be one or the other
<#\>It's gotta be
<$A> <#\><[>Yep</[></{>
     <#\>It's gotta <{><[>be</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>It's</[></{> gotta suit both then
<$A> <#\>It's gotta be<,> an industrial dispute<,> about an
industrial matter<,> and it's gotta<,> be<,> of an interstate
character<,,> <#\>Now so<,> to get yeahto get a
hearing  the commonwealth commission orand  <O>inaudible</O> in the courtin
the arbitration court <,> it had to satisfy those
requirements <#\>Now over time<,> um we've seen a gradual
broadening of the commonwealth powers <#\>We've seen the high
court<,> intreinterpret  um<,,> the<,,> the consthe constitution  and broaden
the powers<,> for the feds <#\>Now<,> the important words
ifif  we're looking at<,> sort of establishing<,> trying  to get jurisdiction
we've got to erswe've got to first of all 
establish that we've got an industrial dispute <#\>Does
anybody know how we get an industrial dispute
<$B> <#\>Lodge a claim
<$A> <#\>An industrial dispute <#\>Sorry
<$C> <#\>Do you
<$A> <#\>Oh lodge a claim
<$C> <#\>Lodge a claim <#\><{><[>Is that</[> right
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>That's right <#\>Lodge a claim <#\>Yeah
<#\>So lodge a claim <#\>How dohow do we 
do that <#\>Do we sort ofwe can have  a
paper dispute <#\>Do you remember<,,> <@>firstnameM1</@> 
talking about a paper dispute <#\>You don't actually have to
have a strike
<$B> <#\>Do you<,> submit some kind of <{><[>form</[> or
something like that
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Serve <{><[>on <O>inaudible</O></[> <#\>That's
right
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{>
<$Z> <X><#\>To the commission</X>
<$B> <#\>To the commission
<$A> <#\>Well it'syou  serve the log of
claims on the employer and then it's rejected<,> so that<,>
theoretically it takes a dispute <#\>We don't have to have the
all out strike <{><[>or anything like that</[>
<$B> <#\><[>So you serve it</[></{> to employer
<{><[>first</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> yeah <#\>So<,,> the first
requirement's fairly sort of easily settled <#\>We
canwe can  have a paper dispute an industrial
dispute um <#\>It's fairly easeasily 
settled<,> <#\>But in the past we had this problem about<,>
um<,> that it had to be in an industry <#\>Do you remember<,>
the discussion about that um that it had to be in an industry
of a productive nature um associated with making a profit and
therefore teachers and um firemen and all those sorts of
people couldn't get access to the federal commission <#\>Um
that sort of ahwell originally it was  um
an industrial dispute waswas  um<,,> term
it sort of<,,> interpreted  quite widely
to begin with inin the  sort of nineteen
oh four period <#\>It was it it was  um<,>
interpreted as being what the man in the street thoughtthought  about it<,,> <#\>Um<,,> um
<O>laughs</O> but then um<,>
<$C> <#\>I think it's the overhead projector
<$A> <#\>Oh is it <O>laughter</O>
<$C> <#\>It's got a scanning device <O>laughter</O>
<$D> <#\>And it's got a microwave on the top
<$C> <#\>Oh don't
<$D> <#\>Yeah <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Um yeah <#\>So wewe  had sort of
originally um<,> aquite a  reasonable
interpretation that an industrial dispute was anything that
the man inthe common man  in the street
thought it was but then we had in the nineteen twenties a
fairly narrownarrow  interpretation
applying toto  industriesproductive industries  um and it's not until<,>
<#\>Do you remember what the major<,> sort of case was that
widened this<,,> <#\>Modern industrial dispute<,>
<#\><@>firstnameM2</@> spoke about it last week<,,> <#\>The
social welfare workers case<,,> <#\>Do you remember that
<$Z> <X><#\>It was<,> the social welfare union</X>
<$A> <#\>Sorry
<$Z> <X><#\>Union <#\><{><[>Social welfare</[> union</X>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah social wel</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>Um in that case<,,> the meaning of industrial dispute
was said to mean a dispute between employers and employees
about wages and conditions of work so it's<,,> employers and
employees <#\>Fairly broad definition <#\>So thatthat  really broadens the commonwealth powers or
you know sort of broadens um<,> or allows more people to gain
jurisdiction in the federal court
<$C> <#\>Oh so it <{1><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1> that<,> social
work <w>'cos</w> that would come under<,> like teachers and
that kind of where they're not really seen as producing<,>
<{2><[2>something</[2> some sort of like <O>inaudible</O>
people
<$A> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah yeah <#\>That's right yeah <#\>That's why
teachers and firemen theythey've  you know
those sorts of <{3><[3>people</[3> weren'twho
weren't  making you know <{4><[4>these <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>Yeah</[4> <#\>That's right <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\><[3>Right</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4><O>inaudible</O></[4></{4>
<$B> <#\>So how did that<,,> how did that 
case actually solve that
<$A> <#\>Well because it it  widened the
terms of reference to say that aa  dispute
is anything between an employer <{><[>and</[> an employee
about conditions of work <#\>Not being in so and so industry
<#\>Not being you know <#\>It didn't say that
<$B> <#\><[>Right</[></{> 
     <#\>So in <{><[>anything</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> yeah yeah <#\><{><[>It's anything</[> <#\>A dispute <#\>Yeah <#\>Common sort of
usage<,> um <#\>Then we've got the um<,,>
the  industrial matter <#\>It must also be about an
industrial matter <#\>Now<,,> what<,>
what  do you think is an industrial matter <#\>If you<,> do you  think<,> things like um
putting workers on and off<,,> ah retrenchment of workers<,,>
um <#\>Do you think that downpayment of superannuation is an
industrial matter<,,> 
<$B> <#\><[>Any employee</[></{>
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>If it's<,,> if it's  in
relation to people who are working it is isn't it <#\>Like it
um<,,> anything industrial
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$E> <#\>Anything that affects the employment relationship you
know is industrial
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,,> <#\>What do you think<,> what
do you think  about childcare <#\>Do you think
childcare is an industrial matter
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>The provision of child care at the workplace<,,>
<$E> <#\>It wouldn't be<,> previously <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>You think that it's a
<$E> <#\>Not directly<,,> <#\>Indirectly
<$B> <#\>It should be<,,> 
<$A> <#\>It ahit's  interesting um<,,>
<#\>An industrial matter now<,> um<,,> under <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>The decision in Cram in New South Wales collieries<,> the
nineteen eighty seven decision<,> really broadened<,> 
jurisdiction in this area <#\>It said that <quote> an
industrial matter is anything that is likely to cause an
industrial dispute</quote> that anything that escalates from
um <#\>An industrial dispute thatit 
escalates from anything<,,> can be an industrial matter so
you've got again a rea wideneing  of the
federal powers um
<$E> <#\>So where'd it come from
<$A> <#\>That's a Cram C-R-A-M and New South Wales collieries
um<,> <#\>So that<,> if you're prepared to go on strike about
something<,,> youand  you know it
escalates to become an industrial dispute um then it can be an
industrial matter <#\>So that really makes it really broad
<#\>Anyanything  <#\>You know you can
<#\>As long as you're prepared to go out on strike on
something<,> it will become an industrial matter <#\>Now that
doesn't mean that the comission will give it to you<,> <#\>It
doesn't mean that<,> the commission will make an award on it
<#\>They might say<,> child care<,,> doesn't relate to
employment<,> but they can say it's an industrial matter and
they can hear it <{><[><,></[><,> so um<,,> yeahso
we've got <,,> a broadening of industrial matters
<#\>The last requirement we're talking about is
interstateness<,> <#\>Remember we we'rewe're  faced with a constitution that says that
it's got to be um prevention and settlement of um industrial
disputes extending beyond the limits of one state so we've got
to satisfy the requirementthe  requirement
of interstateness um <#\>Now the Wooldumper's case and I've
forgotten the year here I can't tell you the year um said
that<,> any matter that<,,> that <,> um
takes on an interstate<,,> er character if<,> an organisation
involved is a federally registered organisation <#\>So
if you belongit doesn't  have to be a strik
in<,> you know<,> two different states or anything like that
<#\>If you're a member of an organisation which haswhich is  federally registered<,,> um<,> like say
you're a member of the federated teachers union or something
like that and you go on strike<,> um here and say<,,> you know
for argument's sake we talk about the university of New South
Wales I go on strike or my colleagues go on strike um and um
we're members of the federated<,,> whatever we call ourselves
the academics union um that'sthat's 
satisfied that interstateness requirement
<$E> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>So<,> only if you're a member of an interstate<,,>
union <#\>Like<,> it's not the industry that's interstate it's
the union
<$A> <#\>Yeah that's right
<$B> <#\>Right
<$A> <#\><{1><[1>Or the employer <#\>Yeah <#\>So yeah</[1>
either either a um federally registereda
federally registered organisation  either being a union
or an employer <{2><[2><,></[2><,> so that if your employer <#\>Say
you worked for an accountant who's<,> a member of the AAustralian  Society of Accou erof
Accountants  <{3><[3><,></[3><,> um<,,> and they are
registered with the Federal Commission<,,> um<,,> youyou  then become entitled or you're a member of the
federal uniion
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh right yeah <#\>That makes more sense</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>
<$C> <#\>So you wouldn't necessarily have to belong to a union
as well<,,> <#\><{><[>Or</[> that sort of is a union<,> is
it
<$A> <#\><[>Well</[></{>
     <#\>You'd have to be <#\>Yeah <#\>You'd have to
be<,>long<,> to a union because to get<,> jurisdiction in
<$C> <#\>Oh yeah
<$A> <#\>Yeah  yeah <#\>So you have to be belongbelong  to a union <O>inaudible</O> <#\>All right
so<,> that's thatthat's  the main reason
why we had this sort of limitation <#\>We had to satisfy all
these requirements <#\>It's only been in the last sort of ten
years that we see a broadening of these judgements<,> to allow
um other parties jurisdiction in the commission um <#\>The Federal er parl the federal<,> parliament are also um
orfederal awards  are also limited by the fact
that there is no common rule <#\>Again because of this
necessity to have an intersthat they can only
intervene in interstate  industrial disputes that means
they can't set a common rule award <#\>Do you know what a
common rule is<,,>
<$E> <#\>No <#\>Explain
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>That's an ahthat's when
it  um applies to everybody in the industry <#\>Because
it's got to be in answer to a dispute<,,> um it the the feds  can't legislate in this area so it's they don't have a common rulea common
rule  won'twon't  apply
<$B> <#\>So they can only legislate<,> to the enterprise
<O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>No <#\>They can onlythey can
only <,> legislate in areas of where there is a dispute
and the parties in the dispute <#\>Only<,> <{><[>for the parties in the</[> dispute <#\>They get around it by roping
in <#\>What they do is they<,> and this is why we see these
sort of big claims<,> but they can get inget
around it  byby  um<,> ropewhat they call  roping in <#\>They<,>
name<,,> every employer
<$B> <#\><[>For the parties <#\>Right</[></{>
     <#\>Like what Bradman has done
<{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><[2>Yeah that's right</[2></{2> 
     <#\>Yeah <#\>Theythey  name every
employer that they can get their hands on to rope them in <#\>Um and
this is why it it's  such an <O>inaudible</O> procedure,
because she serves up an invitation on um you know all all those employers <O>inaudible</O>
is quite expensive </I>
