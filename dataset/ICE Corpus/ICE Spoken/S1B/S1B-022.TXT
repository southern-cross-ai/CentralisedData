              Russell Hogg, from Academics for Justice
              Sharon Davis, <quote> Background Briefing</quote> Producer
(who made programme <quote> Who Bombed the Hilton</quote> )</&>

<I><$A>    <#\>Can you tell us how it felt to walk out of the dock
on Thursday knowing that for the first time in thirteen and a
half years the Hilton bombing's no longer hanging round your
neck
<$B>         <#\>Well it was an enormous relief Liz, but um I
wasn't able to experience any sort of normality for quite a
number of hours because ah there was the contrast of walking
from a a bare cell into a huge mob of ah journalists with
cameras and so on <O>sort of laugh</O>, so it wasn't really any
normality for quite a while
<$A>         <#\>Well yours is not a normal situation <#\>I mean
why do you think it is that you, twice, have been charged with
such serious crimes
<$B>         <#\>Well you can't understand it unless you look at
the history I think, and the fact that ah police in the ah,
who have been promoted in the New South Wales Police ah
resented the pardons we received in nineteen eighty-five and
comments I made after that, and there's been a history of
conflict even since then <#\>Um that creates the basis for
understanding why police didn't like me and why, if you like,
they were out to get me, but ah there are a number of specific
questions that are still unanswered about that
<$A>         <#\>Wh what are those questions
<$B>         <#\>Well in particular, why they chose to charge me
back in um May nineteen eighty-nine <#\>Their story is it was
based on the statement of Ray Denning <#\>I don't believe that
<$A>         <#\>This is the statement of prison informer Ray
Demming Ray Denning, who said that you'd confessed to him in
gaol that you were indeed the Hilton bomber
<$B>         <#\>That's right, and we proved at trial that ah on
one of the two occasions he said I I so called confessed to
him, ah I wasn't even in the same gaol as him <#\>In the ah Court
of Appeal judgement made ah a couple of days ago, the Chief
Justice's said that he believed the jury would have or should
have placed little or no weight in that statement <#\>Now how is
it that ah police, experienced police, and whatever I might
think about the police in this case, there not stupid <#\>Ah how
is it they decided to launch such a major prosecution based on
evidence that clearly was going nowhere?
<$A>         <#\>Mmm <#\>I mean I I read myself that the Chief
Justice described that evidence as as fragile I think was the
word he used <#\>I mean Russell can can you tell us, I mean how
how would that decision have been made to proceed with the
case <#\>I mean the police just had one statement as I understand
it from Raymond Denning and and as a sighting from a taxi
driver, and decided to to proceed with this case <#\>Who would
have made that decision
<$C>     <#\>Well I assume the decision was probably made by
the p the police officer in charge of the investigation <#\>Um,
but what this highlights really is the enormous discretion ah
that police exercise at that particular level to, in some
cases, choose to accept statements which on their face are
extremely dubious, in other circumstances to um to to possibly
ignore ah evidence which which should be ah investigated
further <#\>And I mean one has to say that this runs through the
whole thirteen year saga <#\>Um back to Zurich, um and the way in
fact in which the the the earlier prosecution was actually
handled
<$B>         <#\>If I can just butt in here, it's interesting to
notice that um some three months before the trial, there was
an advice from the prosecutor, ah Mr Dudeski, who ran the
trial, um in response to an application for a no bill, that
said I have not yet decided whether or not I will call Raymond
Denning at the trial
<$A>         <#\>So he himself had doubts about Denning
<$B>         <#\>It appears that he did <#\>And ah however
subsequently he called him and supported him very strongly at
the trial
<$A>         <#\>Well of course we all know that what happened
after Denning made his statement and after Arnie Tees
charged Tim, that Evan Pederick came forward in Brisbane and
said Look I am indeed the Hilton bomber <#\>And of course we all
also know that Evan Pederick is still in gaol <#\>I mean given
that Tim's been acquitted of this case, I mean wha what does
that say about the innocence or guilt of Evan Pederick
<$C>     <#\>Well you you have to conclude that Evan
Pederick was was convicted on evidence which has just
collapsed now <#\>Um whatever involvement he may or may not have
had actually had in the events, he was certainly convicted on
a story which, in its essentials, just holds no water 
<$B>         <#\>The only really real clear thing you can say is
that you know that that what however the Hilton bombing
happened, it had nothing to do with the story he told the
court <#\>It seems, particularly from some of the recent
documents that have come into our possession, that um Pederick
in fact did try to do deals and is very unhappy with the fact
that a lot of those deals failed 
<$A>         <#\>And w what are what are these recent documents
you are referring to
<$B>     <#\>Well one in particular um shows that ah, very soon
after arriving in Sydney in nineteen eighty-nine, his
solicitor approached the prosecutors and required a full
indemnity before he would give evidence against Anderson
<#\>That's from a file note I have here
<$A>         <#\>So you're saying that when Evan Pederick came
to Sydney, he was saying `I will only give evidence against
Tim Anderson if I get a complete indemnity'
<$B>         <#\>That's right, and it seems that was rejected
<#\>There's no record of him being rejected on that but obviously
it didn't happen <#\>However he still received a reduced sentence
on the basis of the evidence he'd given against me <#\>Now, some
further information I've received ah this year is to the
effect that ah Evan Pederick is still very unhappy with his
sentence and has ma taken some steps towards appealing that
sentence
<$D> <#\>I think the interesting thing about this Liz is that
the way that Evan Pederick presented himself in the trial was
not as a man who wanted full indemnity for giving evidence <#\>It
was a man who had this terrible burden of guilt, who needed to
um expunge that guilt to get over what had happened, and who
needed to spend time in gaol even to get over what had
happened <#\>We've got a very interesting excerpt of Evan
Pederick that we'll here now
<&>EXTRA CORPUS - recording</&>
<$A>         <#\>Russell can I ask you what effect it would have
made to the case had the DPP decided to go along with the
deal, I mean had they offered Pederick the indemnity he had
sought
<$C>     <#\>I think um I think in vital respects, and one
has to be speculating here about the jury of course, ah we
weren't inside the jury room, but I think in vital respects,
the gut<,>s of the the prosecution case turned on the
credibility that derived from from Evan Pederick having not
only not only ah confessed to the crime, but h having been
convicted an and imprisoned for it, and it and the prosecution
played that card all the way down the line, and I think
without that I think um some of the glaring problems with the
evidence would have been more apparent to a jury <#\>In fact the
the the Chief Justice made it clear in the appeal when he said
<quote> Were the jury in this case trying to decide whether Tim
Anderson was guilty or whether they were trying to decided
whether Evan Pederick was guilty</quote> <#\>And in vital respects the
way the Crown run the case, they were suggesting well, <,>
<#\>Evan Pederick, if if you conclude that Evan Pederick is
guilty, and how could you conclude otherwise given the fact
that he's put his hand up to this crime, you must conclude
that Tim Anderson is guilty <#\>Now, I think the Court of
Criminal Appeal really ah ah ah drove a a a bulldozer through
that logic
<$A>         <#\>The Court of Criminal Appeal also identified
the major weakness in the case <#\>I mean you're saying they
identified the major strength as Pederick's preparedness to go
to gaol, but the major weakness in the case being Pederick's
ever-changing story about what actually happened when he tried
to assassinate somebody <#\>I mean it's a bit unclear who he
tried to assassinate, but when he had tried to assassinate
somebody at the CHOGM Conference, um can can you just
spell out for us, I mean, just what did happen in terms of
those changing scenarios because that's been identified as the
major weakness in the Crown case
<$D> <#\>Well there are a number of scenarios <#\>The first
scenario that he told the Queensland Police, and in fact was
followed through right up until the time of his own trial, was
that he saw Miragii de Si stepping from a limousine, in
George Street, outside the Hilton Hotel, and at that stage he
attempted to detonate the bomb <#\>Now it wasn't until his own
trial that in fact Malcolm Fraser, the former Prime Minister,
came forward and said <quote> That is not the case <#\>Miragii de Si
did not arrive in George Street <#\>In fact he arrived in Pitt
Street</quote> <#\>So at that point the Crown had to find a new Indian-
looking man that had arrived in George Street, and what they
hit on was the President of Sri Lanka, ah Mr Jawardenay,
who had arrived in George Street that day <#\>Now Pederick gave
again the same account but this time it was replaced with Mr
Jawardenay arriving in the afternoon, in George Street,
and he attempted to detonate the bomb <#\>That account they lived
with right until the end of Tim Anderson's trial, right
through Tim Anderson's committal and his trial, until it was
discovered that Jawardenay in fact arrived at the Hilton
Hotel at eight o'clock in the morning <#\>So they couldn't live
with it anymore <#\>But what happened was, the Crown in their
summing up, actually then hit upon another <O>laugh</O> entirely
new theory and that was that Pederick had actually attempted
to assassinate de Si, again, back to the original Prime
Minister, when he was leaving the hotel at five thirty in the
afternoon, rather that arriving <#\>The problem was it only came
up in the Crown's summing up, and Pederick was never recalled
to actually answer that description of the attempted bombing
<$C>     <#\>There are just major problems with those
shifts <#\>Ah quite apart from the whole question of whether the
Crown should be involved in reshaping its case as it as it
went along <#\>Ah simply the evidence didn't support ah that
final thesis which which the the Crown p put to the jury
<$D>   <#\>Yes, what was interesting too in the Court of Appeal
was that the Chief Justice actually asked quite a lot of
questions about the arrival-departure theory, and one of the
questions he asked was <quote> Over what period of days did it become
clear to you that that Jawardenay theory could no longer
be a proper theory, and that the de Sii theory was hit
on</quote> <#\>And what became obvious in the Court of Criminal Appeal
was that in fact for a number of days the Crown had no target
<#\>They were searching for another target <#\>So in fact they'd
discounted Jawardenay and they were sitting around looking
for something else that they could hit upon that would fit in
some way Pederick's description <#\>Now of course de Sii's
departure didn't really fit at all, but that was all they
could hit on <#\>The Chief Justice also asked a fairly
interesting question I thought and that was `Why weren't
departures looked at right from the very beginning?'
<$B>         <#\>Well of course we know with the these recent
documents which, ah one of which was referred to in the in the
appeal hearings um themselves, that ah a departure in fact was
looked at back in nineteen eighty-nine and Pederick had
disavowed a figure in the photo, ah in one of the photos
there, as being himself</I>
