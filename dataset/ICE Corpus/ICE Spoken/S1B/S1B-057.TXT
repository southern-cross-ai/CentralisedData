<S1B-057>   <2019>
<I><$A>   <#\>I now move to<,> fifty-four which we have
previously mentioned and ah just for the record<,> the
coalition the<,> opposition   ah ah withdraws that
and will not continue with that ah amendment<,> <#\>I think
that then takes us to<,,> fifty-six<,,> <#\>Is that right
<$B> <#\>Ah I'm advised amendment ten
<$A> <#\>Oh right<,> <#\>Amendment ten ah<,,> <#\>That is ah
dealing with ah<,> ah the carrying on of land management
activities<,> in a with the   agreement<,>
of holders of the land and that deals with para that deals with section   one nine one capital E one
C <#\>This ensures that any land management activities in
relation to the indigenous ah held land is carried out under
agreement<,> with the holders of the land <#\>Er the
government has reflected this in one nine one capital E one
A<,> but I believe failed to carry it through<,> to ah<,>
subsection C of that<,> <#\>Ah there is no reason why land
management activities should be carried on by the indi indigenous   land corporation<,> er without
the agreement of land holders <#\>Um I believe this has been
overlooked and ah<,> I think it's a point that needs to be
remedied <#\>In fact<,> I I might recall if I
recall correctly   during the<,> ah committee<,> ah
hearing<,,> on finance and public administration ah there was
a question I think I<,>  I   put to Mr
Dillon on this point and um<,> he believed that one A covered
it er <#\>If I might just turn to that ah<,,> and just point
out where I think that the<,> the   defect
is<,> because what you've got is ah<,> is  
perhaps a different situation in A as opposed to C and<,>  the
section is headed functions and it comes under <quote>land
management functions of the I-L-C</quote> <#\>One nine one
capital E one A<,> states<,> that the land management
functions of the I-L-C are to carry on<,> or to arrange for
the carrying on of land management activities in relation to
indigenous held land under agreements<,> with the holders of
the land <#\>Now that<,> so far so good  
<#\>There's nothing<,> ah ah  nothing  
wrong with that<,> but then in C it says <quote>to carry on
other land management activities in relation to indigenous
held land</quote> <,> so what I saw is a a or what
I see is   is a contradiction<,> because<,> in A you're
saying well the I-L-C carries on land management activities ah
under agreements<,> with the holders of the land<,> but then
in C it can carry on other activities<,> and<,> with<,>out<,,>
the agreement<,> of the land holders <#\>So the ah the   problem the opposition has with that<,> is
that why have you got it in one subsection<,> that you do it
with the agreement of the<,> holders of the land<,> and not in
the other subsection <#\>What are these <quote>other
activities other land management
activities  </quote> and I I   believe
that is ah open for ah<,> ah open to be
misconstrued   and and   really leaves
it open ended <#\>It is the opposition's firm belief<,> that
any land management activities should be carried on<,> by
agreement with the the   land holders<,,> 
<$C> <X><#\>The minister Senator Evans </X>
<$D> <#\>Can I<,> suggest to Senator Ellison that<,> 
<O>inaudible</O> whether he wants to proceed with this
amendment<,> for reasons that I'll ah I'll  
now explain<,,> <#\>It's a function of the very wide
definition of land management activities which appears in
subclause five <#\>If you look at land management activity
without that definition it does sound as though what you're
talking about are essentially intrusive activities involving
the management ah in an ordinary sense of that word on a
particular piece of land and what you're saying is very<,>
prima facie intuitively plausible in that context but when you
look at the definition of land<,> management<,> activities<,>
you'll see that among other things it contains over the page
on page six of the bill <quote>disseminating
information</quote> <,> whether on a commercial basis or
otherwise about land management practises and environmental
practices relating<,> to land<,,> <#\>There's<,> a lot of
other things <#\>Providing training and providing
environmental management services um<,> which ah are more
specific in character and which may or may not have relevance
here but certainly information <#\>Now contemplate a situation
where<,> Indigenous Land Corporation<,> in the<,> general<,>
exercise of its land management responsibilities in relation
to indigenous held lands<,> wants to disseminate information
on land care to land to indigenous   land
holders right across the country <#\>Now to have to seek the
agreement<,> of all land holders to that kind of aspect
<O>inaudible</O> to the land management activity<,> bearing in
mind that that's the sort of thing that is covered within the
definition that's the kind of thing that's intended<,,> um is
in fact to impose a wholly unnecessary ah restriction<,,>
<#\>It's not the sort of thing that er would be imposed on any
other<,> body with these sorts of functions and ah<,> it's
really for that reason<,,> that ah C is there<,> in that
form<,> in that kind of ah open endedly expressed way um<,>
and you can<,> I think rely on<,> obviously the ah either the   incapacity on one hand or the<,>
or the ah or the   good sense of the ah I-L-C when
it comes to sort of seeking to impose  <,> ah some very
intrusive land management activity on a on
a   land holder<,> um without their agreement and that'd
be a senseless thing to do but<,,> what you're talking about
is adding really a new bureaucratic imposition <#\>It follows
from the drafting of the bill that it's needed to have an open
ended clause in that way <#\>If you don't have something in
the functions clause in one ninety one E one<,> which is broad
enough to subsume<,> um this sort of thing that that   is covered by land management activity<,>
then you find yourself in a situation where the ah the   corporation lack the power to do certain
things it might well want to do and which we might well want
it to do<,> and the classic case being the dissemination of
information <#\>So could I just suggest that ah<,> while again
it's I'm   not<,,> in any way contesting
the ah the   good intentions of ah of that   particular amendment can I just put to you
that it is unnecessary <#\>It's unnecessarily restrictive
<#\>We oppose it of course
<$C> <X><#\>Senator Ellison </X>
<$A> <#\>Thank you ah<,,> <#\><O>inaudible</O> with your
definition of land management activities<,> um<,> you have<,>
in<,,> ah subsection five<,> ah a list of<,> ah aspects of the
definition <#\>That is it runs from A through to E <#\>Now<,>
some of those are ah <#\>Well<,> they're all quite sensible of
course but<,> what I'm saying is that<,> which ones do you
carry on by consent with the land holders<,> and which ones
don't you <#\>Now<,> if there was some<,> ah ah definition
there where<,> in C it was spelt out well the land management
activities ah do not include A of the definition<,> that is
the carrying on a business that involves the use care or<,>
involvement of the land <#\>You see you've used dis
dis dissemination   of information <#\>Well that's
fine <#\>That that   could be done without
their consent ah in accordance with C <#\>I can understand
that<,> but<,> of course<,> <O>inaudible interjection</O>
<#\>Ah yes <#\>Well let's include that um<,>but training<,>
for sure <O>inaudible interjection</O> <#\>Yeah but but   what I'm looking at is<,> A where you look at
the definition of of   man land   management activities carrying on a
business<,> um that involves the use care or improvement of
the land <#\>Now that is something which should involve the
consent of the land holder<,> because that's involving the
land itself <#\>Now<,> that's where I say<,> that when you
look at the definition section in in  
subsection A<,> that's a very much different land management
activity to simply<,> providing services or disseminating
information and so<,> where you<,> um<,,> ah where
you   look at ah the definition of land management
activities you have a range from A to E <#\>A starts off<,>
with<,> you know <quote>care or improvement of the
land</quote> running right through to<,> ah ah
<quote>dissemination of information</quote> <,> which is quite
harmless of course but<,> could be of valuable assistance but
you can see<,> that what I'm saying<,> is that<,,> on<,> the
question of how you use the land<,> the land holder<,> must
be<,> consulted and and   the agreement
obtained<,,> 
<$D> <#\>Minister Senator Evans <O>inaudible</O> a complicated
drafting exercise we could embark upon here to<,> draw up
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>I don't think there's any<,> quick and
easy draft that would just get in A and exclude the others and
so on<,,> ah <#\>Not that we can sort out at the moment but<,>
can I just put it to you another way of solving the problem
that you're worried about <#\>It really follows from the
application of the general law of trespass <#\>Um obviously if
the I-L-C was wanting to actually go onto some one's land to
engage in any of the intrusive<,> land management ah practices
that you're talking about whether it's running a business or
seeking to<,> ah you know do anything else that<,> that  <,> operates against the<,> the   spirit that you've described<,,> <#\>Well
if if   they sought to do that without the
consent of the land holder in question<,> um they'd be ah
guilty of trespass under the existing general law <#\>Now
that's er it's   a reinforcement of the
commonsense point I was making earlier on<,> but I think as a
matter of practical administrative commonsense you can assume
that the I-L-C won't wanna be throwing its weight around in
this fashion<,> but in fact there's a legal <?>inhibition</?>
from it doing so without consent in those situations so I
don't really think you need the extra protection of this
amendment<,> to cover that situation
<$C> <X><#\>Senator<,> Hardy<,,> </X>
<$E> <#\>That's a question that <O>inaudible</O> to ask the
minister <#\>Now if the words in ah<,> one ninety one E one A
if these words were not there<,> <#\>That's to cite the words
um<,> <quote>under agreements  with the land with
the holders of the land</quote>   <#\>If they weren't there<,>
would<,> what you've just said<,> hold true <#\>It would
wouldn't it <#\>I mean the whole<,> question of trespass ah<,>
ah <#\>The issue of trespass would ah would   apply<,> whether or not those words were
there<,,> 
<$?> <#\>Yeah <{><[>yeah</[> 
<$?> <#\><[>Well</[> </{> does that mean<,> even if the words
weren't there
<$?> <#\><{><[>Yeah yeah</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>But those</[> </{> those   words
really've been put in there just to really confer a<,>
special<,> additional capacity upon the I-L-C to enter into
agreements<,> for the carrying out of these particular land
management functions <#\>I mean that's the reason why you've
got the specific<,> subclause there about agreements <#\>It's
not in order to confer ah authority to actually perform an
intrusive land management function because the general law of
trespass would ah  would   inhibit that
<$Z> <#\><X>Senator Harridan </X>
<$E> <#\>Ah chairman under those circumstances um I I   like to hear from the opposition to<,> hear
what<,> precise um<,> land management functions they're they're   concerned about ah which er<,>
ah would in fact ah<,> ah um  would in
fact   um<,> involve um<,> the<,> I-L-C<,> in intrusive
behaviour in respect with the land
<$Z> <#\><X>Senator O'Chee<,> </X>
<$F> <#\>Mr ah Chairman perhaps I can I
can   assist the senator in this matter ah and deal with
the<,> point Senator Harridan has raised in part and it really
looks <O>inaudible</O> to what Senator Evans has said
<#\>Senator Evans<,> said that the amendment's not necessary
because ah if the I-L-C were to do<,> any of the functions
here without the consent of the land owner<,> they may ah be
guilty of trespass <#\>Now the point that I would make is that
there is a possibility that unless this subsection is amended
as er Senator Ellison has suggested<,> it may create an
implied licence in favour<,> of the I-L-C<,> to do these
things <#\>Now<,> in ah subsection five paragraph B<,> the bill the bill   refers <#\>Well this is
what this is what   I wanna explain Senator Kerr
<#\>The bill refers to a number of ah services which could be
performed in relation to the land and it's quite clear clearly   the case that certain technical
services um could mean in the case of of  
urban land<,> not rural land but urban land<,> the ah the   entry onto those premises by I-L-C officers
to to to   ah look at the ah the   structure of a building there or some other
matter and ah in relation to<,> ah paragraph ah<,> E of
um<,>  of that   er subsection in relation to ah
paragraph B subsection ah subparagraph  <,>
six</I>
