<I><$A> <#\>Humans have existed of earth<,> for the blink of an
evolutionary eye<,,> <#\>In our short stay on this planet<,>
we've established ourselves as the dominant species<,,>
<#\>Populations increase <#\>Technology flourishes<,> <#\>Towns
and
cities cover the land<,,> but they're not entirely ours<,,>
<#\>Hidden amongst them are creatures which've adapted to our
presence<,,> <#\>They've made their homes in our homes<,,>
<#\>Some
four hundred million years ago among the first creatures to
leave the oceans<,> were primitive spiders<,,> <#\>In Australia
alone there are more than two thousand species<,> which live
successfully in the most extreme habitats our country has to
offer<,,> <#\>All spider species are carnivorous and virtually
all use venom to subdue their prey<,> prey which in most
cases is insects<,> but never anything larger than a frog or
small bird <#\>As for we humans well<,> our vulnerability to
spiders is a cruel twist of biochemistry<,,> and it's
created<,> unreasonable fear and paranoia<,,> and potential
disaster for spiders<,,> 

<#\>Spiders  are one of nature's pest controllers<,> and
agriculture<,> horticulture<,> and even in and around
households<,> <#\>They are amazing creatures <#\>Their webs are
made
from silk<,> which can be stretched over a third of its
length<,> and recover without distortion<,,> which is at
least<,> twice as strong as steel<,,> yet we regard them with
a horror which boarders on paranoia<,> <#\>Their effect on our
environment like their presence<,> is largely unseen<,,> but
this just seems to deepen the sense of mystery<,> and
suspicion <#\>One spider that's all<,> too well known is the
funnel web <#\>That's partly to do with its size and preference
for urban areas<,> but mostly because of its subspecies Atrax
Robustus one of the world's deadly spiders <#\>Up until the
nineteen eighties<,> its bite was virtually<,> a death
sentence<,,> <#\>Funnel webs don't like direct sunlight so they
seek refuge in moist dark nooks and crannies<,,> <#\>Bites most
often occur when we unwittingly<,> provide them<,> with
shelter<,,> <#\>The funnel web is a large spider<,> which
appears  even more ferocious when provoked<,> <#\>Its fangs point
downwards<,> so in order to strike it rears up on its hind
legs<,,> <#\>Its retractable fangs can be almost a centimetre
long<,> and are powerful enough to pierce a human
fingernail<,,> <#\>Funnel webs are only found in Australia<,>
<#\>The most venomous species is Atrax Robustus<,,> which used
to
be called the Sydney<,> funnel web<,,> <#\>As human populations
have expanded<,> they have moved with them and are now found
as far north as Newcastle<,> and over the Blue Mountains to
the west 
               <O>film break</O>  
<#\>Before an effective anti-venom was developed there were at
least thirteen recorded deaths in Australia <#\>An anti-venom was
first successfully tested in nineteen eighty one<,> and since
that time there have been no known fatalities<,,> but bites
are still a common occurrence every summer
               <O>film break</O>
<#\>The Australian reptile park in Gosford on the New South Wales
Central Coast encourages members of the public to bring in
funnel web spiders they've caught<,,> <#\>The park is the sole
provider of toxin<,> for the production of anti-venom<,,>
<#\>Tiny droplets from the tips of the fangs are gathered and
sent
to a serum laboratory in Melbourne for processing<,,> <#\>The
lethal component of the funnel web's venom is known as
atraxatoxin <#\>It affects primates and new born mice<,> but
other animals are unaffected even by large doses <#\>It's only
found in the male<,> which suggests<,> that it's not necessary
for the survival of the species<,,> so<,> atraxatoxin is
simply a genetic accident<,,> but one with far reaching
consequences<,,> <#\>A bite from the male can cause a deep coma
if it isn't treated properly<,> <#\>Human victims have been known
to die<,> in just fifteen minutes<,,> <#\>Even the size of the
fangs<,> and the acidity of the venom<,> make the funnel web's
bite a very painful one<,,> 

<#\>The most common time to find funnel webs is in summer and
autumn<,> when the males roam in search of a mate <#\>They often
fall into swimming pools<,> and can stay submerged for several
hours<,> so a check before swimming is always a good
idea<,,> <#\>Still to come on Deadly Australians<,> Australia's
most dangerous snake

<#\>Though the redback spider is far smaller than the funnel
web<,> its venom is more potent<,,> <#\>No deaths have occurred
since an anti-venom was developed in nineteen fifty six<,> but
its bite is still enough to cause serious illness<,,>
               <O>Child</O>
<#\>Richard Briley lives in Brisbane <#\>Three different doctors
were
unable to correctly diagnose his redback bite <#\>Thanks to his
mother Karen's perseverance<,> he was eventually treated<,>
forty three hours later<,,>

<$B> <#\>Well he was bitten at eight thirty on the Saturday
night <#\>Well he wasn't he didn't get injected with the anti-
venom til about quarter to three on the Monday <#\>They're in
plague proportions around here and it's just a shame that I
couldn't understand why the doctors couldn't pick it up

<$A> <#\>This was probably due<,> to the fact that the actual
bite
is often painless and puncture marks aren't always
evident<,,> <#\>Other symptoms like muscular weakness<,>
paralysis<,>loss of coordination<,> vomiting<,>
and fainting<,> may only develop later<,,> <#\>Redbacks are
found throughout Australia <#\>Their preference for urban
environments<,> and the ability to colonise them quickly<,>
seems to suggest<,> that they're an introduced species<,,>
<#\>They usually head<,> for dark dry places<,> and our suburban
streets and homes provide plenty of them<,,> <#\>They will build
anywhere<,> and often<,> where you might least expect<,,> <#\>A
redback's web is one of nature's great feats in engineering
<#\>It's divided into two sections<,,> a larger funnel section<,>
for shelter<,> and a bottom section<,> for trapping prey <#\>The
brilliance in engineering lies in these fine sticky lines
known as trip lines <#\>Between them<,> run guy lines <#\>When
an
insect becomes entangled in here<,> the guy lines snap<,> and
the trip lines pull the food<,> back to the spider's den
<#\>Unlike funnel webs redbacks are very small <#\>The brightly
coloured female grows to about a centimetre <#\>Only she<,> is
capable of killing a human<,,> and she's at her most dangerous
when she's defending her eggs<,> in the web <#\>Females can store
sperm<,> for up to two years and lay hundreds of eggs<,,>
<#\>These eggsacs are resistant<,> to insecticide<,> so killing
the adult is no guarantee of destroying an infestation<,>
<#\>Once redbacks are established in an area<,> they're almost
impossible to wipe out<,,> <#\>These scanning electron
microscope shots show the difference in the two spiders'
fangs <#\>The funnel web<,> hunts for its prey<,> so its fangs
are strong and powerful<,> <#\>They're curved because they strike
downwards<,> in order to inject their venom<,,> <#\>The female
redback's fangs are much shorter<,> and smaller by comparison
<#\>It relies on its web<,> to trap victims<,> so the fangs don't
need the same strength <#\>They curve inwards<,> and act like
pincers<,,> <#\>Yet the redback's venom is more toxic<,>
<#\>Fortunately it takes longer for it to take effect<,,> but the
redback spider's bites<,> are still the greatest single cause
of invenomation<,> in Australia <#\>More than snakes<,> and
marine stingers combined<,,> <#\>One effective way of
controlling redbacks<,> is to leave other spiders' webs intact
around the house <#\>Spiders like the daddy long legs<,> feed on
redbacks<,,> <#\>Looks can be deceiving <#\>Most of us wouldn't
have any problem at all handling one these daddy long leg
spiders<,> but it's actually the world's most venomous spider
<#\>Fortunately its fangs aren't long enough to pierce human
skin<,,> <#\>As for that popular redback legend<,> well there's
no proof<,> that they have a particular liking for the great
Australian dunny<,,> <#\>So next time you take that long walk
late at night<,> remember<,> there may be eight little eyes<,>
watching your every move

<#\>Not too many other countries would like to think of their
national symbol<,> as a dangerous creature <#\>Kangaroos have
become part of our international reputation<,> and are
regarded overseas with a combination of curiosity<,> and
affection<,,> <#\>It might surprise some people to know that
some of these marsupials<,> have another side to them<,,> <#\>If
an unsuspecting human is attacked by one of the larger of the
kangaroos<,> the injuries inflicted<,> could be fatal<,,> <#\>A
kangaroo's weapon<,> is his hindlegs <#\>He uses his forepaws for
grasping and dragging in<,> leans back on his strong tail<,>
kicks out with both hindlegs at once<,> and slashes at the
groin of his opponent with his sharp middle claw <#\>He doesn't
have much in the way of protection<,> but he does have one
unusual adaptation <#\>His pendulous scrotum<,> can be retracted
up into his stomach<,> so that it's not damaged or worse
still<,> removed<,,> <#\>There are many factors which determine
how dangerous a snake is <#\>Even the most toxic snake with the
longest fangs and the worst temper<,> can hardly be considered
dangerous<,> if it doesn't come into contact with humans
<#\>Unfortunately Australia's most dangerous snake<,> is found
all
too commonly in our backyards<,,>  <#\>Until nineteen fifty
four<,> a full bite from a taipan<,> meant certain death<,,>
<#\>Although it was the most urgently needed<,> taipan anti-venom
was one of the last<,> to be developed<,,> <#\>Fortunately
taipan venom isn't<,> the most potent<,,> but in all other
aspects it rates equal with<,> or above<,> Australia's other
venomous snakes<,> and has earned the reputation<,> as the
most dangerous snake in Australia<,,> <#\>It's the longest of the
venomous snakes<,> and this is an advantage when striking<,>
<#\>If cornered<,> it will go on the attack <#\>Its length<,>
means
it can strike high<,> making the bite more effective<,,>
<#\>Unlike their cousins the vipers which can fold their fangs
back<,> the <O>inaudible</O> have permanently erect fangs<,>
which limits the length<,> that they can grow <#\>They average
about four to five millimetres<,> <#\>The taipan's fangs can grow
to be twelve millimetres<,> that's about<,> the length of my
fingernail<,> which makes for greater killing power<,,> <#\>Like
the <O>inaudible</O> snake the taipan uses a strike and
release method of attack <#\>Unlike the <O>inaudible</O>
snake<,,> it will bite<,> repeatedly <#\>Its long fangs<,> mean
the venom can be injected to a far greater depth<,,> and
therefore<,> have a greater effect<,,> <#\>In one reported
attack<,,> a twelve year old boy<,> died less than an hour<,>
after being bitten<,,> twelve times<,> by a taipan<,,>
<#\>Taipans are most commonly found in well grassed tropical
woodlands<,,> but their preferred diet of<,> small rodents<,>
birds<,> and the occasional bandicoot<,> means they're often
found near farm outbuildings<,,> and even urban
backyards<,,> <#\>In comparison<,> the tiger snake isn't
considered as dangerous as the taipan<,> yet it accounts for
far more bites than any other snake in Australia<,,> <#\>This
tiger snake is shedding its skin<,> <#\>The process called
sloughing<,> happens about five times a year<,> <#\>Immature
snakes<,> slough as they grow<,> but in adults<,> it occurs to
replace damaged<,> and worn skin<,,> <#\>The eastern tiger snake
is found from the south-eastern corner of Queensland<,> down
through New South Wales and most of Victoria and up into South
Australia<,,> the most densely populated corner of the
continent <#\>This brings it<,> into contact with humans far more
often than most snakes<,,> <#\>When it does come into contact
with us<,> it's unlikely to flee<,,> <#\>If you do happen to
find a snake in a building<,,> discretion is the better part
of valour <#\>Don't try to remove it <#\>Just give it a wide
berth<,> and it will usually go out the way it came in<,,>
<#\>An overexcited snake is more likely to attack<,,> so if it
comes towards you simply move quietly out of the way <#\>It's<,>
probably just curious<,> or even lost<,,> <#\>This is a Chapel
Island tiger snake <#\>Its darker colour<,> is due to its cold
habitat in the Bass Straight<,,> <#\>When it feeds it works its
jaws in a chewing motion<,> <#\>The fangs are very small<,,> but
the venom<,> is extremely potent <#\>By injecting large
amounts<,> the venom quickly begins the process of breaking
down the food<,,> <#\>The fangs also aid in the act of
swallowing<,,> <#\>The snake literally walks along its victim<,>
forcing it down its throat<,,> <#\>Still to come<,,> introduced

<#\>Sometimes<,> individual animals are too small to be
