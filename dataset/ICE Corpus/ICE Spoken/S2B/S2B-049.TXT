<S2B-049> <2005>
<I><$A> <#\>Well thank you very much Donald Horne for your
introduction and ah<,,> for<,> inviting me here<,> er this
morning to share breakfast with you <#\>It was really<,> a
most opportune invitation as I<,,> ran out of muesli yesterday
and er didn't have time to get to the shop <#\>Now I have to
say that my scope for intellectual activity at this time of
the day is is somewhat limited so
<O>laugh</O> I hope you er<,> will indulge me in that way
<#\>Also I thought women and citizenship was p'raps an
indigestible theme for breakfast so I'll really concentrate on
one woman's view of citizenship<,> <#\>And I wonder first of
all can we actually formulate<,> a woman's view of
citizenship<,> <#\>In this day of er equality and anti-
discrimination laws surely women have the same citizenship
rights and obligations<,> as men<,> <#\>Well in theory and in
law<,> that is true at least in nineteen ninety four<,,>
<#\>Women and men do have the same rights to participate in
the conduct of public affairs<,> directly or through freely
chosen representatives as the covenant on civil and political
rights says <#\>They have the same right to vote and to stand
for election the same right to have access to public
service<,> <#\>In reality though a degree of suspicion should
be raised by the question that I ask because it is always
asked in the same way <#\>No-one asks whether<,> a man has the
same citizenship rights as a woman <#\>A man's status as
citizen was somehow taken for granted whereas a woman's was
not <#\>Women ha started from<,> a
different position whether behind or below I'm not sure<,> and
their level <,> ah their citizenship had
to be fought for<,> <#\>Their level of direct participation
has been<,> quite low <#\>And my theme is the way that women
have used<,> their citizenship to participate in our democracy
and to advance their agenda<,> in the political debate and
contribute to the<,> values of our society <#\>And of course
the primary right of citizenship is to participate in setting
the rules which govern our political life<,> making our
constitution and so on and our constitution starts with these
glowing words <quote>we as the people of the various states
humbly relying on the blessing of God have agreed to unite in
one indissoluble fed federal commonwealth
under the crown etcetera </quote> but<,> in four of our
states<,,> ah people did not include women <#\>Only in South
Australia and Western Australia could women vote in the
referendum to approve the constitution and<,> Aborigines I
think not at all or hardly at all <#\>Women couldn't choose
the delegates to the<,> constitutional conventions and the
eighty seven<,> ah members of those conventions were all
men<,> <#\>So women had to<,> use the good offices of men to
get their voices heard and their main concern was the issue of
suffrage<,> <#\>They'd petitioned about this to the
constitutional conventions and did succeed<,> in having a
provision in the constitution which guaranteed<,,> that
pe ah that women who could vote at state
elections would also be able to vote in federal elections and
that ultimately led to<,> the vote for women throughout
Australia both federally and later in the states <#\>Well<,,>
are these issues important after a hundred years <#\>You
could<,> take the view perhaps that women<,> supported the
constitution or opposed it in<,> a about 
the same proportions as men<,,> <#\>But you could equally
argue that the constitution would inevitably have been
different if women had taken part in the debate <#\>Women may
have sought to include protection of equality rights
entrenched protection<,> and may've objected to the language
of the constitution <#\>It is<,> exclusively male ex except of course where it refers to<,> her majesty
Queen Victoria <#\>Now I can't answer the questions er<,> as
to women's<,> actual view of the content of the constitution a
hundred years ago <#\>The fact is that<,> women did not have
the right to participate directly <#\>It was a long time
before women were elected to parliament and even longer before
they were there in more than tiny numbers<,> <#\>So there is
one view that says that<,> granting votes to women at that
time of federation did no more than co-opt them into endorsing
a form of patriarchal government<,> <#\>But there are other
ways<,> in which citizens can take part in the conduct of
public affairs <#\>Well often enough<,> we citizens are
content<,> to leave it to our representatives to set the
agenda for political discussion<,> and simply choose between
different candidates and parties but<,> we can also directly
influence and change the agenda through political organisation
and campaigning <#\>The environmental movement is an important
example of this <#\>It's a it's influenced
the choice of voters<,> and affected the outcome of elections
for <,> for more than ten years<,> <#\>Now
Australian women haven't followed the example of the Greens
and they haven't followed the example of Icelandic women who
formed their own political party quite successfully<,> <#\>But
the voting power of women has certainly influenced the
political agenda and women have learnt to<,> adopt effective
political strategies to ensure that their concerns are given
priority <#\>Even though significantly under-represented in
parliaments<,> they've had<,> great success in this form of
organised action especially in the last twenty years <#\>It
was in the nineteen seventy two election that women<,>
launched an extensive program of social change which coincided
er happily with the advent of a reformist government<,> and
Hugh McKay in his book on reinventing Australia describes the
process<,,> in these words <#\>He says that <quote>hardly any
aspect of the Australian way of life has remained untouched<,>
by the revolutionary change in the way Australian women have
come to see themselves over the past twenty years</quote> and
he's talking there about<,> social<,> economic and political
life<,,> <#\>The changes we've seen in this period include the
acceptance of equal pay introduction of anti-discrimination
and equal opportunity laws<,> measures to deal with violence
against women<,> increased support for child care<,> social
security extension and family law reform <#\>So far as access
to public service is concerned and that is an attribute and
right of citizenship<,,> er guaranteed under the covenant<,,>
until nineteen sixty until the nineteen
sixties in the federal sphere women<,,> did not
have<,> equal<,> access <#\>Nevertheless since then<,> they
have succeeded within the bur the
bureaucracy in establishing<,> new structures to
pursue women's goals <#\>Marion Sawyer commented that<,> by
the nineteen eighties Australia had become a model of how to
introduce feminism into government <#\>She talks of <quote>a
quiet revolution<,> in the considerations taken into account
in the formation of public policy</quote> <#\>So women are<,>
beginning to make their presence felt<,> too in parliaments
<#\>Several have led their parties <#\>Three have been heads
of government with considerable<,> public support but their
numbers are still too low<,> <#\>And at least federally<,>
they have not yet had impact on some of the main bases of
power in party politics in cabinet in parliament<,> or in
policy areas such as economics trade foreign affairs and
defence <#\>As a result it's hard at this stage er if at all
possible to define a distinctive input of women <#\>And we
need to consider for a moment why there are not<,> more women
in parliament in nineteen ninety four <#\>Now those more
knowledgable than I on such matters<,> have suggested that
there are still negative attitudes towards women in the
parties and<,> there are pre-selection er procedures which
favour<,> party stalwarts usually male <#\>Barriers of time
and place make it difficult for many women already juggling
dual responsibilities to<,> be active politically or to take
part for example in trade union activities<,> <#\>In this
connection it seems unlikely that if women<,> had been able to
take part in the federation debate they would have agreed to
the seat of government being placed so far away from any major
city thereby making it even more difficult for those with
family commitments to take part in national government<,>
<#\>Other obstacles er that people ah mention are the
parliamentary procedures the adversarial nature of the debate
the competitive<,> and aggressive culture<,> and the lack of
role models <#\>The all these might be
thought to put women off although it doesn't put all women off
clearly <#\>It's said too that<,> there's a lot of pressure<,>
on the small number of women in parliament to adapt to the
established male values and practices to succeed <#\>Where
there are too few women they often have to concentrate on
women's issues so-called because they want to achieve<,>
change<,,> <#\>And they may be even assigned to women's issues
rather than to economics or justice transport or defence
<#\>And as a result they're torn between the desire to reject
the values of a system which excludes them and the need to
engage in it to produce change<,> and we should be grateful I
think that more and more are willing to engage in it in that
way <#\>My personal view is that if a greater participation by
women is considered a public good<,> or even something that
women electors want very much and I think they do<,> then all
the adjustments necessary to achieve this should not have to
be made solely by women as is now the case<,> <#\>Greater
equality in sharing family responsibilities to is
to me a necessary element in the process<,> <#\>And a
good foundation for equality in political participation would
be<,> equality and democracy in relationships and I realise
I'm saying this on what turns out to be Valentine's day
<O>laughter</O> so I I mustn't be too
cutting<,> towards er the the gentlemen
and so I would um encourage the er my 
female colleagues and friends here today to to erm you know give give the
fellows a chance to show what they're capable of
<O>laughter</O> <#\>Get them you know now and then to<,> do
the poached eggs<,> er <#\>After all when you see a man
struggling<,> with<,> the eggs in the morning I mean it
it it's not that he does it well it's that he
does it at all that counts <O>laughter</O> <#\>Well now<,>
recent <#\>Coming back to the sombre theme that I'm pursuing
<#\>Recent changes in the sitting hours of parliament<,,> are
extremely welcome<,> not just for themselves but because they
show that nothing's inflexible there and that<,> further
change is possible <#\>There does appear to be growing
commitment to that change from all our political parties and
if women<,> could share equally in political power and in the
formation of policy I'm convinced that the conduct of public
affairs would change <#\>I can't pre predict exactly how <#\>Perhaps it's the style
<#\>Perhaps it's the priorities <#\>But I'm sure that change
will happen <#\>Of course I don't assume that women share the
same views on political issues <#\>We don't<,> necessarily
agree with each other or with anyone else for that matter but
um I think that women can bring different approaches to issues
and originality of ideas which are derived from their life
experience from the fact that women have had to bring into
public life <,> the wholeness of their life experience<,,> er
<#\>They haven't been ah <,> they haven't
been ah able<,,> to<,> be relieved entirely of their
other responsibilities their other priorities<,> <#\>And we
need<,,> that diversity of experience in our public life and
to fully realise women's citizenship <#\>Now the <,,>
 another aspect of citizenship I want to mention
briefly today is the <,,> is that which
relates to national identity or the values and visions of our
society <#\>Now<,> this is not simply a matter of
assertion<,,> <#\>Our national values don't depend on rhetoric
<#\>They're built up<,> by our collective action as a as citizens <,,> er sorry <#\>Collective action as
a nation<,> in international and domestic affairs and by our
individual actions as citizens both men and women <#\>Well we
could easily indulge ourselves<,> on being a democratic
society committed to justice equality tolerance and the rule
of law and we'd probably like to think of ourselves in that
light<,> as would many other democracies but<,> how how would we test the validity of these assertions
or<,> determine whether they've been given<,> a uniquely
Australian expression</I>
