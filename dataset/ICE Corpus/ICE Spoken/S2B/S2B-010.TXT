Baskin <#\>Two Sydney league stars in court over the alleged
assault of several women at a birthday party <#\>Banks welcome
a Federal ministers proposal for annual fees on credit cards
in return for reduced interest rates <#\>The new federal
ministry holds its first meeting in Canberra with the Prime
Minister warning against complacency <#\>New South Wales
teachers to undergo special training to deal with students who
have intellectual difficulties or physical disabilities <#\>An

<#\>Australian league stars Greg Alexander and Mark Gyer have
appeared in court charged over the assault of four women
<#\>Patrick Burns reports
<$B><#\>A crowd gathered to watch Alexander file into the
Penrith court house with brother Peter sister Megan and fellow
kangaroo Mark Gyer the four of them charged in relation to the
assault of four women at a twenty first birthday party for
league player Brad Fitler <#\>The women have claimed they were

<$A><#\>The Banker's Association's welcomed new indications
that annual credit card charges might be on the way but it
says banks should have the autonomy to determine the size of
the charge <#\>The new assistant treasurer George Geer would
like to see a low annual fee and a charge for each transaction
in return for a big reduction in interest charges <#\>Bankers
Association spokesman Alan Cullen says banks should be
entitled to set the credit card transaction fees themselves 
<$C><#\>After all this system applies in every overseas
country except Australia and also in Australia credit unions
already make charges of that kind because they're not covered
by the same restrictions as the banks and people have not been
complaining about those credit union charges where they have
those cards
<$A><#\>Consumers Association spokesman Jeff Surmy says the
user-pay system would only be fair if banks dropped their
credit card interest rates quite substantially
<$D><#\>We've been sort of opposing transaction charges in ah in savings and cheque accounts mainly
because they are an addition to what people have already been
paying if you like <#\>It's er it's 
the banks increasing their margins at consumers expense <#\>If
it was done at a reasonable level I suppose ah we'd be
certainly interested to look at it and I suppose it's easier
for consumers to work out what they're doing <#\>it may well
even discourage people from over using credit cards
<$A><#\>The Prime Minister has told the first meeting of his
ministry the party shouldn't be complacent after its election

commitment to tourism with the appointment yesterday of the
sixth tourism minister in five years <#\>New comer Michael Lee
Takes over the tourism portfolio from Alan Griffiths
<#\>Shadow tourism spokesman David Jowd says all the chopping
and changing shows Labor isn't taking the vital industry
seriously 
<$F><#\>Now tourism is the most vital industry that
Australia's got going for it at the moment <#\>It's about the
only industry that's got the capacity to dig up big numbers of
jobs for our young people and is a major foreign exchange
earner and you would think that if the government was really
serious about tourism and the future growth of tourism they'd
at least give it some stability
<$A><#\>Future New South Wales teachers will have to undergo
special training to cope with students with disabilities and
learning difficulties or be refused work <#\>Bob Sharp has

<$H><#\>There is a er wide spread recognition that a knowledge
of er special edu education training
practice and the needs of children with er er
 with disabilities not only helps children with
disabilities <#\>It is very good practical knowledge and
experience for general classroom teachers

National News <#\>A State Opposition enquiry claims the
Department of Housing breached the Fair Trading Act in its

help from charities
<$I><#\>To be belittled all the time <#\>Getting knocked
backed for jobs <#\>To have to actually go to a charity that's
what really puts you down <#\>And the next step to get kicked

affecting the fishing industry
<$J><#\>We certainly want to address fish-kill ah <#\>There's
some ah operations around the world with what was known as
fish excluders <#\>So it's using the 
 the pressure waves in water which are the and
with with ah larger mash on the top of
the net fish can get through and we're certainly ah looking at
those very very closely <#\>Ah we're looking ah the speed of
trawlers <#\>So whether that's affecting the catch of fish
<$A><#\>Fishing cal clubs association
president Bruce Shumakker says prawn trawlers must be made to
change their methods to stop the waste of fish
<$K><#\>But I think the main point is that there are methods
to reduce that ah that by-catch
<#\>There are things such as fish exclusion devices and
there's been a fair bit of work done overseas that 
 that <#\>They've proved that in certain
circumstances they do remove a lot of that by-catch in the
nets <#\>So that the fish effectively don't finish up in the
pocket of the net so that they then 
 they never come on board the boat <#\>They never
have to be thrown back usually dead <#\>They escape from the
net before the net's actually pulled in

<$L><#\>While the government may not be sympathetic to the view
that there should be tax rebates for private health care
funding there is a strong groundswell of opinion from the
community that there should be <#\>Ah but there is one thing
the government can do straight away and that is to ah indicate
to the people the seven million people who've retained their
private health care coverage that they've been doing something
which is very worthwhile <#\>Something that's 
 that is good for their 
 themselves their families and for the country
