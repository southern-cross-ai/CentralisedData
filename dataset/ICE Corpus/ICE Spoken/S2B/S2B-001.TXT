<I><$A>    <#\>Forest protesters declined to comment on camera <#\>A
spokesman later said the group was made up of timber industry
workers and farmers all incensed at what they see as an attack
on their livelihoods by the Green Movement although some
logging workers today distanced themselves from this protest
<#\>Two of the protesters were taken with police escort to film
the damage <?>NEFA</?> is angered about <#\>In the words of their
spokesman <quote>they were working on behalf of the general
public to correct the inaccuracies of the media</quote> <#\>Also
today <?>NEFA</?> agreed to allow workers to retrieve their
bulldozer from the blockade
<$B>      <#\>We're happy to have it removed as long as it doesn't
cause any further environmental damage
<$A>      <#\><?>NEFA</?> and the Forestry Commission are
expected to meet in the next few days in an attempt to resolve
their differences 
<$C>      <#\>It's been revealed that at least ten former workers
on North Coast cattle dip sites have died of cancer in recent
times and another worker who's just been diagnosed as having
cancer says there were few if any precautions taken when he
was working with chemicals
<$D>      <#\>Since the release of the report into cattle tick dip
sites last month attention has centred around chemical
contamination at former sites but it now appears there's a
much more pressing issue <#\><?>Benalbo</?> resident Ted Collins
worked on several sites for over twenty years and now believes
he's paying the price <#\>After years of bad health Mr Collins was
diagnosed as having a rare blood disorder called Barton's
Syndrome <#\>He currently takes around thirty potassium tablets a
day and says his life is ruined <#\>But he could be one of the
lucky ones
<$E>      <#\>I think it's time that someone spoke out because
there's been too many people dying with cancer and and I
strongly think that it it's coming from the from the uh
malignants that we use in the dips
<$D>      <#\>But Mr Collins is only one of a number of former
tick board workers from Benalbo who've suffered ill health
It's understood a former general practitioner in the region
who's now deceased expressed grave concern that at least six
local residents had been poisoned by chemicals at tick dips
<$F>      <#\>The other men were concerned and so was Ted that
they might lose their jobs so they didn't do anything about it
<#\>Like he wanted to test them all out to see if it was the same
thing
<$D>       <#\>In recent times at least two former workers living
in Benalbo have been diagnosed as having cancer <#\>A non-smoker
Tom Hale has just been treated for throat cancer <#\>Mr Hale
clearly recalls cleaning out D D T contaminated sludge from a
dip site in gumboots and a singlet He was admitted to hospital
soon after
<$G>      <#\>I think I just I just got that sick and and sort of
lost control of me head I just giddy you know stupid vomiting
and uh I finished up in hospital for three weeks and and the
local doctor was here at the time the G P Dr <?>Marn</?> he's
dead now <#\>He thought it was dip poisoning 
<$D>      <#\>The Department of Health is currently conducting a
survey of former tick board workers but according to Ted
Collins it can't get underway soon enough
<$C>      <#\>Black sludge from an oil spill in North Queensland
is now washing up on pristine sections of the Barrier Reef
<#\>It's regarded as one of the most serious spills ever to hit
the area Authorities believe the oil was deliberately dumped
and they think they know who did it 
<$H>      <#\>As far as oil slicks go this ones by no means a
monster but you're looking at about five tonnes of heavy oil
<#\>The mess is more than twenty kilometres long and three wide
<#\>The oil was spotted early yesterday in a very remote area
Temple Bay about six hundred kilometres north of Cairns
<#\>Already it's washed onto parts of the Barrier Reef It's
threatening a colony of sea birds and it could poison coral
and mangroves <#\>The slick probably didn't get there by accident
<#\>Authorities have a fair idea which ship dumped it by cleaning
out its ballast tanks <#\>Dumping oil is illegal and it can be
very expensive <#\>Offenders face a million dollar fine but the
simple fact is that doesn't stop ships from washing out their
tanks at sea
<$I>      <#\>Commercial shipping uh has known for twenty years
that this is illegal <#\>It's just been going on and on <#\>In fact
they seem to be even more frequent in the last few years
<$H>      <#\>Conservationists reckon oil is washed overboard in
Australian waters at least once a month and they say the
reason so many ships get away with it is because the coast is
not policed enough 
<$J>      <#\>It's like road accidents <#\>We're never going to be
able to outlaw road accidents likewise we're never going to
outlaw uh irresponsible behaviour but we can certainly
penalise it <#\>A million dollar fine's are very tough indeed
<$H>      <#\>Maritime officers are keeping an eye on this latest
oil slick It's hoped rising winds will break it up over the
next few days <#\>A ship suspected of dumping the oil is due in
Mackay tomorrow
<$C>      <#\>Terry Metherill is expected back in Sydney tonight
with the state government still in crisis over his job
appointment <#\>Premier Greiner is facing criticism from inside
and outside his party <#\>Now a key independent John Hatton is
planning to launch a censor motion against the government
<$K>      <#\>If there is <{><[>sufficient</[> 
<$L>      <#\><[>John Hatton</[></{> was in is Nowra electorate office
today warning the Greiner government fate is in the balance
<#\>He'll be moving his own censure motion against the government
over the Metherill Affair when parliament resumes on Tuesday <#\>If
that motion finds Metherill had been given a financial
inducement to resign it could be extended to a vote of no
confidence
<$K>      <#\>Mr Greiner is in grave peril <#\>His leadership is in
question His judgement is in question <#\>Next Tuesday will be D
day 
<$L>      <#\>John Hatton says he won't be attending a meeting
tomorrow between Premier Greiner Tim Moore and the two other
non-aligned independents aimed at heading off a parliamentary
show down <#\>Premier Greiner has already caused another storm by
explaining why he refused to tell his cabinet colleagues about
the Metherill offer
<$M>      <#\>The notion that you would uh you would discuss this
amongst uh vast large numbers of people is not on
<$L>      <#\>Energy Minister Robert Webster the only cabinet
minister to emerge publicly today refused to accept the
Premier didn't trust his cabinet
<$N>      <#\>No the Premier didn't say that I didn't certainly
interpret it that way
<$L>      <#\>The opposition is now gearing up for parliament's
resumption on Tuesday <#\>It's pushing ahead with legislation to
block the Metherill appointment without compensation and has
even put a price on the Metherill Affair
<$O>      <#\>Potentially this is the cost run down <#\>Two hundred
thousand dollars for the by-election four hundred and forty
thousand dollars for Metherill's superannuation payout five
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the five years of the E
P A job <#\>The figure will be less if the government sacks
Metherill leaving him with one year's salary as compensation
<$P>      <#\>What ever the outcome of this sordid affair it has
already cost the taxpayers a fortune
<$L>      <#\>The Opposition also claims the government can
dismiss Terry Metherill without compensation under existing
Public Service regulations
<$Q>      <#\>The Crown has an ancient right to dismiss an officer
uh at pleasure for no reason or for good reason and to do so
without compensation
<$L>      <#\>Cabinet is certain to reconsider the Metherill issue
before parliament resumes on Tuesday
<$C>      <#\>In Djarkata Prime Minister Keating has been warned
to keep out of Indonesia's internal affairs <#\>The warning came
from President Soeharto as two leaders sat down for
talks on human rights in East Timor after the Deli massacre
<$R>      <#\>Mr Keating's second day began with a wreath laying
tribute at Indonesia's Cemetery of National Heroes <#\>Australia's
links with Indonesia's battle for independence against the
Dutch a fact both leaders are recalling <#\>At the official
banquet a dose of Javanese culture and a warning from
President Soeharto Indonesia will not tolerate meddling
in its internal affairs <#\>Mr Keating didn't duck East Timor but
he emphasised the diplomatic advances in dealing with it 
<$S>      <#\>These substantive links have enabled our governments
to maintain a frank and constructive dialogue especially
during the past few months following the tragic events in East
Timor last November
<$R>      <#\>Already the Prime Minister has signalled in private
talks with Indonesia's Foreign Minister Australia would like
to see a better deal for the people of East Timor with a
lesser role for the military and it's a message for president
Soeharto too <#\>Human rights and the resolution of the
East Timor issue were key talking points in the face to face
talks but Mr Keating had other concerns on his mind as well <#\>As
the two leaders witnessed the signing of three new agreements
between our countries Australia was urging more formal
ministerial links and a leadership role for Djarkata in the
Asia-Pacific economic cooperation arrangement <#\>At his news
conference Mr Keating was very happy with progress
<$S>      <#\>If the last day has been any measure of of things in 
terms of reception it doesn't get much better than this 
<$C>      <#\>Ahead in the news a council at war in the ocean
outfall debate and the final walk from death row for a
convicted killer<,> <O>pause for ads</O><,>
<$C>      <#\>Time finally ran out in California this morning for
convicted killer Robert Harris In the state's first execution
in twenty five years <#\>Harris died just before dawn in the San
Quentin gas chamber <#\>His death came after a night of legal
wrangling and several temporary reprieves 
<$T>      <#\>Behind the lights of San Quentin Harris' last hours
were a nightmare of legal wrangling <#\>Three times he was told
the execution had been temporarily deferred <#\>Once he was
actually strapped into the gas chamber when the phone rang
with a last minute postponement <#\>Outside the emotional strain
showed on the dozens of demonstrators for and against the
death penalty <O>break while American speaks</O> <#\>Almost at
dawn officials rushed media witnesses onto buses to return to
the gas chamber viewing area <#\>The last appeal had been
dismissed Robert Alten Harris was taken back to the chair and
the sealed chamber was filled with gas <#\>It engulfed him for
eleven minutes and he was officially declared dead before some
three dozen witnesses <O>American speaks</O> <#\>Parents of the
two teenage boys Harris killed believed he looked to them
<O>American speaks</O> <#\>Now that California has finally
executed its first murderer in twenty five years many people
are wondering if the flood gates are open <#\>There are some three
hundred people on Death Row in this state alone <#\>Harris'
remains were returned to his family
<$C>      <#\>At the same time in California Charles Manson the
master mind of one of America's most infamous mass murders has
again been denied parole <#\>Now fifty seven Manson was originally
sentenced to die in the gas chamber for the grisly slayings of
pregnant actress  Sharon Tate and eight others in Los Angeles
in nineteen sixty nine <#\>But the California Supreme Court threw
out the death sentence law leaving Manson with the only
alternative life in prison with possible parole <#\>This was his
eighth bid for freedom <O>American speaks</O> <#\>The parole
board was unconvinced <#\>Manson will have to wait five years for
another hearing <#\>The former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia
<O>name of place</O> is on the brink of civil war tonight
<#\>Serb militia men have taken control of more than half the
country with the open support of the Federal army and air
force <#\>In the capital Sarajevo there've been
artillery and machine gun battles in the streets <#\>The Red Cross
speaks of many dead <O>Englishman speaks</O> <#\>Back home
Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital is to become the first centre
outside Sydney to have sophisticated equipment for diagnosing
serious brain and spinal diseases <#\>A timely announcement by
Health Services Minister Ron Phillips who faced criticism over
inadequacies in the Hunter's health services
<$U>      <#\>Waiting for Mr Phillips was a line of picketers still
hopeful of saving the Hunter's Wallsend Hospital which closed
last August despite a meeting with picketers and members of
Newcastle Trades Wool Council</I>
