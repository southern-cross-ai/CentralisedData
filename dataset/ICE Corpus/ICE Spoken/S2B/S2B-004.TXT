<I><$A>  <#\>Good evening <#\>Iraq and the United States are tonight
on
the brink of new military confrontation following yet another
Iraqi raid into Kuwait <#\>It's the third attack in as many
days testing the patience of the U S and its allies who've now
signalled they're ready and willing to strike back

administration takes over but there's nothing to suggest the
US will wait before going after Sadam <#\>President Bush this
morning still calling the shots which many agree are now
imminent <#\>The latest violations include erecting anti-
aircraft missiles in Iraq's northern no-fly zone and the
constant movement of others in the south <#\>Sadam's
redeployment in the north has made it harder to deliver food
and medicine to Kurds under UN protection
<$X>  <X><#\>Taken in their totality there's not much question
that
Iraq is violating the ceasefire arrangements</X> <O>music</O>

defence minister discussing preparations for war while in New
York Iraq's ambassador called to the U N and told there'd be
no more warnings reinforced that Baghdad was taking all
threats very seriously

to have uh the uh Iraq <O>inaudible</O>on alert</X>

told
how for the third straight day Iraqis have forced their way
into the demilitarised zone and stolen weapons <#\>Pentagon

New South Wales the bottom line is an extra one hundred and
four million dollars a year twice that offered by the
Commonwealth <#\>But after meeting Federal Minister Brian Howe
Mr Phillips declared the Medicare deadlock may soon be over
<$D>  <#\>And I believe that today we are on the verge of a
breakthrough in the Medicare negotiations

national health summit and a pledge to use extra Medicare
funds to solve health problems in Sydney's west and the north
coast

money include four hundred and eighty thousand dollars spent
by Elcom for advice on corporatisation which failed to proceed

the Premier's department over a hundred thousand dollars

invite people to give their solution to beating the problem of
speed  now said to account for more than a third of all fatal
