<&>OCKHAM'S RAZOR  5/4/91, 12/4/91, 19/4/91
Speaker: Professor Jonathan Stone,

<I><#\>There is much in our times of which we can be proud <#\>I
mean we
the species, homo sapiens <#\>For we are the most spectacularly
successful, complex and fascinating species on earth <#\>We have
mastered agriculture <#\>We've banished diseases before which
other species are helpless <#\>We've developed traditions of law
and welfare to care for the common citizen and we've developed
systems of education to build, preserve and build still
further the knowledge on which our complex societies depend
<#\>And our energy seems unending, and our productivity without
limit <#\>We've explored not just this planet but its moon and
even its sister planets <#\>We probed the limits of the cosmos
to
understand its origin and fate <#\>We untangle the mysteries of
our development, of our resistance to disease, and even of our
own minds <#\>We have built machines and vehicles of a thousand
sorts and developed complex patterns of reward to encourage
such productivity still further <#\>Though we alone of earth's
species have the intellect to understand the implacability of
death, we remain, by and large, an optimistic and adventurous
lot, full of plans for the future <#\>Ours is surely the most
advanced generation of our species, and we may be the only
species of this complexity and achievement in our galaxy <,>
<#\>Yet we cannot deny either the dark side of our times <#\>Just
in
this century the First World War, the Great Depression which
followed it, then a Second World War culminating in the
deployment of nuclear weapons, and the long Cold War with its
chilling calculus of mutually assured destruction, and now the
prospect of environmental disaster <#\>As we have created
extraordinary institutions and technologies, we have also made
possible the most awful catastrophes <#\>What are we to make of
this coincidence of the best and worst in human affairs <#\>From
such a coincidence an artist might make, as did Charles
Dickens, a superb opening to a great novel on the dreams and
nightmares of revolutionary Europe <#\>Do you remember how
Dickens began his Tale of Two Cities <#\><quote>It was the best
of times</quote> he wrote <quote> <#\>It was the worst of times
<#\>It
was age of wisdom; it was the age of foolishness <#\>It was the
epoch of belief; it was the epoch of incredulity <#\>It was the
season of light; it was the season of darkness <#\>It was the
spring of hope; it was the winter of despair <#\>We had
everything before us; we had nothing before us <#\>We were all
going direct to heaven; we were all going direct the other
way</quote> A preacher on the other hand might make a sermon,
chiding his congregation to avoid evil and cherish good,
offering as guidance the eternal truths of his faith <#\>A
prophet might focus on the worst, warning of apocalypse,
challenging the heedless the bare today the guilt the future
disaster <#\>Today, and in the next two talks, I will try to make
something of this coincidence by drawing on a different
tradition, on the intellectual tradition of science, which
bodies such as ANZAAS and the Australian Academy of Science
seek to foster through their great conferences and lectures
and foundations <#\><,> Science is a powerful intellectual
venture <#\>But science has contributed to both the best and
worst of our achievements, and the development of further
technologies is as likely to exacerbate as to solve the
crises of today <#\>One unambiguously valuable contribution can
however be made by science, to the resolution of the
environmental crisis, at the intellectual level <#\>We can
formulate questions about the crisis which will help us
understand what is happening to us and how best we can
respond <#\>For the power of science stems not from some supposed
a priori knowledge of objectivity of the scientist, but from
the power of the scientist's questions <,> <#\>In today's debate
over the environmental crisis, for example, it is important
that we go beyond questions which are commonly asked in the
debate <#\>Obvious questions like `Should we not be caring of the
environment' or `What will happen to us if we do not mend our
careless ways' <#\>We should go beyond such questions and ask a
question whose answer takes us beyond its premises <#\>Why, I
would ask, why are the best and worst of human affairs so
intertwined <#\>The question seems not to have been asked in the
long debate over the future of humanity in the face of our own
success, a debate which can be traced to the late eighteenth
century when Thomas Malthus published his essay on
population <#\>This is a powerful question I will argue because
to avoid environmental disaster, we must learn to separate our
best from our worst, and to do that we must first understand
their linkage <#\>So with this question in mind, let's look at
some of our disasters <#\>Much has been written of the origins
of
the First World War and the instability of the Balkans and the
mystic ideologies of blood and iron on one side and the
vampire on the other, which in the first decades of this
century roused citizens throughout Europe and in this country
to a mood of militarism <#\>Such analyses are not relevant here
But it is of interest to ask not why this war took place, but
why it was so awful, the war to end wars <#\>Nationalist war was
not new in nineteen fourteen, nor mystic ideologies, nor riot
in the Balkans <#\>What was new was the ability of governments
to
organise nationwide conscription, to move and supply great
armies, and to use the emerging media to mobilise public
opinion <#\>The populations of Europe had increased sharply since
the last major European wars and the industrial revolution had
lifted the levels of education and competence of the common
man and therefore of the common soldier <#\>The war had its
origins in the same mixture of fear, pride and adventure which
had always led nations to war <#\>Its new awfulness was
inseparable from the growth of three features of human society
which we have always cherished: people, knowledge and
communication <,> <#\>From the chaos of World War One ensued the
economic depression, boom and depression of the nineteen
twenties and nineteen thirties which Fascism rode to
government in Italy and Germany forming popularist
dictatorships whose brutal impact was intensified by the
continued growth of people, knowledge and communication <#\>They
took the democracies by storm, drawing them into a second
world war by any measure except perhaps the use of poison gas,
but by any other measure, more terrible than the first <#\>The
cycle of boom and depression was not new in this inter-war
period <#\>What made the cycle so intractable and the breadlines
so long was the internationality of the economic malaise
created by the improved communications of the day which
increased trade between nations and made each vulnerable to
the economic ills of the other <#\>Nor was cruel dictatorship
new <#\>What was new was the growing ability of twentieth century
autocrats to control and motivate populations of unprecedented
numbers and education, an ability which George Orwell feared
might, by nineteen eighty-four, lock all nations into blind
enmity <#\>New technologies and the productivity of modern
industry did not cause the war, but they made it wider in its
sweep and more terrible in its impact than any previous
conflict <#\>Again, the awfulness of this war grew from things
we
cherish: people, their increasing education and competence,
the increased productivity of industry and our new ability to
communicate swiftly between continents <#\>It is history that the
pacific theatre of that most awful of wars closed with the
deployment of a new weapon of mass destruction whose
development over the subsequent four decades made imminent the
spectre of worldwide holocaust <#\>In a century and a half the
meaning of all out war had grown from the bloody but local
fields of Borodino and Waterloo to the fire and radiation of
weapons which could engulf not just the hapless soldier but
whole societies and their infrastructures <#\>The cold war has
haunted humanity ever since <#\>By nineteen eighty-five the two
superpowers had over twenty thousand nuclear weapons targeted
on each other, and they were planning still more complex,
destructive and costly weapons of delivery and defence <#\>Our
science, our ability to plan and execute projects of
complexity and intellectual imagination, had in those same
decades doubled the agricultural output of the fields of Asia,
had produced vaccines against viral diseases and anti-biotics
against bacterial diseases, had placed in orbit satellites
which guide our vehicles of peaceful trade and travel, had
brought distant lands closer and had placed us all under the
threat of fiery destruction <#\>The same technologies which
improve health, education and transport and communication thus
have undesired consequences which can be controlled only by
social institutions <#\>So it is not surprising that in times of
swift technological change, some of the unanticipated
consequences of change outstrip our institutions, no surprise
therefore that the greatest disasters to befall us at our own
hand have occurred in this century of our greatest
achievements <#\>I would like to develop this argument a little
more closely with a comment on the escalation of nuclear
weaponry during the cold war <#\>The mad calculus of that cold
war and the cost and complexity of its weapons led to
sustained efforts of disarmament at two levels <#\>A popular
pacifism made itself heard, great anti-nuclear coalitions
formed throughout the west, a thousand marches were held, a
million banners were waved, protesters ringed hands and danced
around their bases <#\>Yet that movement failed despite the
honour of its intent <#\>Not one government reversed the wisdom
of the centuries to trust in God and keep our powder dry
<#\>When, in the mid nineteen eighties, the Labor Party in
Britain
adopted unilateral nuclear disarmament as policy, it plunged
to massive electoral defeat <#\>With the wisdom of hindsight it
is apparent that the pacifist movement failed because it
addressed only the symptoms of human conflict, our armaments,
and not the cause of that conflict, our fears <#\>The terrible
memories of war, of the death of the young and best, and of
the suffering of civilians under occupation, those memories
can be taken equally as a rebuke to us all to disarm or as a
warning to us all to gird ourselves against aggression <#\>The
fear of conquest was based, it turned out, on experiences
bitter and real as the horror of war and that fear could not
be scolded or sung or danced away <#\>At a second level the same
governments who built the nuclear arsenals also sought an end
to the cycle of armament <#\>Between nineteen fifty-five and
nineteen eighty-three, fifteen separate initiatives to bring
the nuclear arms race under control were undertaken by the
relevant powers <#\>Those patient negotiators hammered out the
Antarctic Treaty of nineteen fifty-nine, the Limited Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty of nineteen sixty-three, the Outerspace Treaty
of nineteen sixty-seven, the Seabed Treaty of nineteen
seventy, the Nuclear Accidents Agreement of nineteen seventy-
one, the Salt One Treaty of nineteen seventy-two and the
Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War of nineteen
seventy-three <#\>And in the late nineteen seventies these
negotiators began the Start Negotiations which have come to
real fruition since the Soviet policy of Glasnost
Disarmament was making real progress <#\>Yet until nineteen
eighty-nine the move to disarm was overwhelmed by the sheer
pace of armament <,> <#\>We have, since nineteen eighty-eight,
lived through a political change that has about it the sense
of miracle <#\>The relaxation of tension between the major powers
has opened politically repressive societies throughout Eastern
Europe <#\>Western Europe has entered a golden age of prosperity
and political openness, and the states of Eastern Europe have
walked away from their past of half truths and secret police
to join that golden age, and they are made welcome <#\>These
changes occurred because one of the superpower antagonists
became exhausted <#\>Once the Soviet Union declared that it would
not intervene further in the politics of Eastern Europe, the
relaxation of fear across the iron curtain was immediate</I>
