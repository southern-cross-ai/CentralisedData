Abstract
We analyze the data on personal income distribution from the Australian Bureau
of Statistics. We compareﬁts ofthedatato theexponential, log-normal, andgamma
distributions. The exponential function gives a good (albe it not perfect) description
of 98% of the population in the lower part of the distribution . The log-normal and
gamma functions do not improve the ﬁt signiﬁcantly, despite having more param-
eters, and mimic the exponential function. We ﬁnd that the pr obability density at
zero income is not zero, which contradicts the log-normal an d gamma distributions,
but is consistent with the exponential one. The high-resolu tion histogram of the
probability density shows a very sharp and narrow peak at low incomes, which we
interpret as the result of a government policy on income redi stribution.

1 Introduction
The study of income distribution has a long history. More than a cent ury
ago, Pareto [1] proposed that income distribution obeys a universa l power
law, valid for all time and countries. Subsequent studies found that this con-
jecture applies only to the top 1 ÷3% of the population. The question of what
is the distribution for the majority (97 ÷99%) of population with lower in-
comes remains open. Gibrat [2] proposed that income distribution is g overned
by a multiplicative random process resulting in the log-normal distribu tion.
However, Kalecki [3] pointed out that such a log-normal distributio n is not
stationary, because its width keeps increasing with time. Neverthe less, the
log-normal function is widely used in literature to ﬁt the lower part of income
Preprint submitted to Elsevier Science 9 October 2018distribution [4,5,6]. Yakovenko and Dr˘ agulescu [7] proposed that th e distri-
bution of individual income should follow the exponential law analogous to
the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of energy in statistical physics. T hey found
substantial evidence for this in the statistical data for USA [8,9,10,1 1]. Also
widely used is the gamma distribution, which diﬀers from the exponent ial one
byapower-lawprefactor [12,13,14]. Forarecent collectionofpaper sdiscussing
these distributions, see the book [15].
Distributionof income xis characterized by the probability density function
(PDF)P(x),deﬁned sothat theprobability toﬁndincome intheinterval from

The exponential distribution has one parameter T, and its P(x) is maximal
atx= 0. The log-normal and gamma distributions have two parameters e ach:
(m,s)and(β,α).Theyhavemaxima(calledmodesinmathematicalstatistics)
atx=me−s2andx=αβ, and their P(x) vanish at x= 0. Many researchers
impose the condition P(0) = 0a priori, “because people cannot live on zero
income”. However, this assumption must be checked against the re al data.
In this paper, we analyze statistical data on personal income distr ibution in
Australia for 1989–2000andcomparethem with thethree function s inEq. (1).
The data were collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS ) using
surveys of population. The anonymous data sets give annual incom es of about
14,000representative individuals,andeachindividualisassignedawe ight.The
weights add up to 1 .3÷1.5×107in the considered period, which is comparable
to the current population of Australia of about 20 million people. In th e data
analysis, we exclude individuals with negative and zero income, whose t otal
weight is about 7%. These ABS data were studied in the previous pape r [4],
but without weights and with the emphasis on the Pareto tail at high in come.
Here we re-analyze the data in the middle and low income range coverin g
about 99% of the population, but excluding the Pareto tail. The numb er of
datapointsintheParetotailisrelatively small insurveys ofpopulatio n,which
complicates accurate analysis of the tail.

To visualize C(x), diﬀerent scales can be used. Fig. 1(a) uses the log-linear
scale, i.e. shows the plot of ln Cvs.x. The main panel in Fig. 1(b) uses the
linear-linear scale, and the inset the log-log scale, i.e. ln Cvs. lnx. We observe
that the log-linear scale is the most informative, because the data p oints ap-
proximately fallona straight line fortwo ordersof magnitudes, whic h suggests

minimize the relative mean square deviation σ2=1

the distribution for 99% of the population. The minimization procedur e was
implemented numerically in Matlab using the standard routines.

characterize the shape of the distributions. The values of these p arameters,
obtained by ﬁts for each year, are given in Table 1. Using the values o fT, we
plotCvs.x/Tin Fig. 1. In these coordinates, the CDFs for diﬀerent years
(shown by diﬀerent symbols) collapse on a single curve for the lower 9 8% of
the population. The collapse implies that the shape of income distribut ion
is very stable in time, and only the scale parameter Tchanges in nominal
dollars. The three lines in Fig. 1 show the plots of the theoretical CDF s given
by Eq. (2). In these coordinates, the exponential CDF is simply a st raight
line with the slope −1. For the plots of the log-normal and gamma CDFs,
we used the parameters s= 0.72,m/T= 0.88,α= 0.38, andβ/T= 0.77
obtained by averaging of the parameters in Table 1 over the years. We observe
that all three theoretical functions give reasonably good, albeit n ot perfect,
ﬁts of the data with about the same quality, as conﬁrmed by the valu es ofσ
in Table 1. Although the log-normal and gamma distributions have the extra
parameters sandα, the ﬁtting procedure selects their values in such a way
thatthesedistributions mimictheexponential shape. Actually,wec onstructed
the gamma ﬁt only for 98% of the population, because the ﬁt for 99% gives
α= 0, i.e. the exponential. We conclude that the exponential distribut ion
gives a reasonable ﬁt of the empirical CDFs with only one ﬁtting param eter,
whereas the log-normalandgamma distributions with moreﬁtting pa rameters
do not improve the ﬁt signiﬁcantly and simply mimic the exponential sha pe.
However, by construction, C(x) is always a monotonous function, so one
may argue that diﬀerent CDFs look visually similar and hard to distinguis h.
Thus, itisinstructivetoconsiderPDFaswell, whichwedointhenextSe ction.

43 Probability Density Function
In order to construct P(x), we divide the income axis into bins of the width
∆x, calculate the sum of the weights wnof the individuals with incomes from
xtox+∆x, andplot the obtained histogram. However, there is subjectivene ss
in the choice of the width ∆ xof the bins. If the bins are too wide, the number
of individuals in each bin is big, so the statistics is good, but ﬁne details o f the
PDF are lost. If the bins are too narrow, the number of individuals in e ach bin
is small, thus relative ﬂuctuations are big, so the histogram of PDF be comes
noisy. Eﬀectively, P(x) is a derivative of the empirical C(x). However, numer-
ical diﬀerentiation increases noise and magniﬁes minor irregularities o fC(x),
which are not necessarily important when we are interested in the un iversal
features of income distribution. To illustrate these problems, we sh ow PDFs
obtained with two diﬀerent bin widths in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2(a) shows the coarse-grained histogram of P(x) for all years with a
wide binwidth ∆ x/T≈0.43.The horizontal axis represents income xrescaled
with the values of Tfrom Table 1. The lines show the exponential, log-normal,
and gamma ﬁts with the same parameters as in Fig. 1. With this choice o f the
binwidth,theempirical P(x)isamonotonousfunctionof xwiththemaximum
atx= 0, and the exponential function gives a reasonable overall ﬁt. Th e log-
normal and gamma ﬁts have maxima at x/T≈0.56 andx/T≈0.29. These
values are close to the bin width, so we cannot resolve whether P(x) has a
maximum at x= 0 or at a non-zero xwithin the ﬁrst bin.
Fig.2(b) shows the PDFforthe year 1994-95with anarrowbin width ∆x=
1 k$, which corresponds to ∆ x/T≈0.05. This PDF cannot be ﬁtted by any of
the three distributions, because it hasa very sharp andnarrow pe akat the low
income 7.3 k$, which is way below the average income of 19.6 k$ for this y ear.
Thispeakispresent forallyears, anditspositionisreportedinthela stcolumn
of Table 1. The peak is so sharp and narrow that it cannot be attribu ted to
the broad maxima of the log-normal or gamma PDFs. We speculate th at this

5peak occurs at the threshold income of some sort of government p olicy, such
as social welfare, minimal wage, or tax exemption. Comparing the em pirical
PDF with the exponential curve, shown by the solid line, we infer that the
probability density above and below the peak is transferred to the p eak, thus
creating anomalously high population at the special income.
We also studied how often diﬀerent income values occur in the data se ts.
The most frequently reported incomes for diﬀerent years are alwa ys round
numbers, such as 15 k$, 20 k$, 25 k$, etc. This eﬀect can be seen in the
periodicallyspacedspikes inFig.2(b).Itreﬂectseitherthedesigno fthesurvey
questionnaires, or the habit of people for rounding their incomes in r eporting.
In addition to the round numbers, we also ﬁnd the income correspon ding
to the peak position among the ﬁve most frequently reported incom es. This
income, shown in the last column in Table 1, is not round and changes fr om
year to year, but sometimes stays the same. This againsuggests t hat the sharp
peak in Fig. 2(b) is the result of a government-imposed policy and can not be
explained by statistical physics arguments.
By deﬁnition, P(x) is the slope of C(x) with the opposite sign. Fig. 1 clearly
shows that the slope of C(x) atx= 0 is not zero, so P(x= 0)/ne}ationslash= 0. Fig. 2(b)
also shows that the probability density at zero income is not zero. In fact,
P(x= 0) is higher than P(x) for all other x, except in the narrow peak. The
non-vanishing P(x= 0) is a strong evidence against the log-normal, gamma,
and similar distributions, but is qualitatively consistent with the expon ential
function. However, there is also substantial population with zero a nd negative
income, which is not described by any of these theories.
4 Discussion and Conclusions
All three functions in Eq. (1) are the limiting cases of the generalized beta
distribution of the second kind (GB2), which is also discussed in econo metric
literature on income distribution [16]. GB2 has four ﬁtting parameter s, and
distributions with even more ﬁtting parameters are considered in lite rature
[16]. Generally, functions with more parameters are expected ﬁt th e data bet-
ter. However, we do not think that increasing the number of free p arameters
gives a better insight into the problem. We think that a useful descr iption of
the data is the onethat has the minimal number of parameters, yet reasonably
(but not necessarily perfectly) agrees with the data. From this po int of view,
the exponential function has the advantage of having only one par ameterT
over the log-normal, gamma, and other distributions with more para meters.
Fig. 1(a) shows that log Cvs.xis approximately a straight line for about
98% of population, although small systematic deviations do exist. Th e log-
normal and gamma distributions do not improve the ﬁt signiﬁcantly, d espite
having more parameters, and actually mimic the exponential functio n. Thus
we conclude that the exponential function is the best choice.
The analysis of PDF shows that the probability density at zero income is
6clearly not zero, which contradicts the log-normal and gamma distr ibutions,
but is consistent with the exponential one, although the value of P(x= 0) is
somewhat lower than expected. The coarse-grained P(x) is monotonous and
consistent with the exponential distribution. The high resolution PD F shows
a very sharp and narrow peak at low incomes, which, we believe, resu lts from
redistribution of probability density near the income threshold of a g overn-
ment policy. Technically, none of the three function in Eq. (1) can ﬁt the
complicated, three-peak PDF shown in Fig. 2. However, statistical physics
approaches are intended to capture only the baseline of the distrib ution, not
its ﬁne features. Moreover, the deviation of the actual PDF from the theoret-
ical exponential curve can be taken as a measure of the impact of g overnment
policies on income redistribution.
