ABSTRACT
Wehavesurveyedsixdistinct‘emptyﬁelds’usingtheAustraliaTelesc opeCompactAr-
ray in an ultra-compact conﬁguration with the aim of imaging, with a hig h brightness
sensitivity, any arcmin-scale brightness-temperature anisotrop ies in the background
radio sky. The six well-separated regions were observed at a frequ ency of 8.7 GHz
and the survey regions were limited by the ATCA primary beams which h ave a full
width at half maximum of 6 arcmin at this frequency; all ﬁelds were obs erved with a
resolution of 2 arcmin and an rms thermal noise of 24 µJy beam−1. After subtracting
foreground confusion detected in higher resolution images of the ﬁ elds, residual ﬂuctu-
ations in Stokes I images are consistent with the expectations from thermal noise and
weaker (unidentiﬁed) foreground sources; the Stokes Q and U ima ges are consistent
with expectations from thermal noise.
Within the sensitivity of our observations, we have no reason to belie ve that there
are any Sunyaev-Zeldovich holes in the microwave sky surveyed. As suming Gaussian-
form CMB anisotropy with a ‘ﬂat’ spectrum, we derive 95 per cent co nﬁdence upper
limits of Qflat<10–11µK in polarized intensity and Qflat<25µK in total intensity.
The ATCA ﬁlter function peaks at l= 4700 and has half maximum values at l= 3350
and 6050.

1 INTRODUCTION
Today, we are fairly conﬁdent that the large scale struc-
ture grew out of primordial seed perturbations by gravita-
tional instabilites in a dark matter dominated universe. Th e
physics that dominates the coupling between matter inho-
mogeneities and the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation anisotropies is diﬀerent on diﬀerent angular sca les
and the multifarious coupling mechanisms are believed to
result in a complicated spectrum of radiation anisotropies
(see, for example, Hu, Sugiyama & Silk 1996 for a recent
review).
The primary anisotropies in the CMB that result from
sub-horizon couplings via gravitational, Doppler and acou s-
tic eﬀects are expected to create features in the anisotropy
spectrum on angular scales exceeding several arcmin; the
cutoﬀ at small angular scales depends on photon diﬀusion,
recombination physics, any reionization at late epochs and
the cosmological parameters that determine the angular
size-redshift relation. Improvements in the precision of m ea-
surements of the band powers in anisotropies in the CMB,
combined with large-scale-structure observations, lead t o re-
ﬁnements in the parameters of the background cosmology,
models for structure generation and matter content of the
universe (see Bond & Jaﬀe 1997, Lawrence, Scott & White
1998 and Gawiser & Silk 1998 for examples of the valuesof CMB anisotropy measurements in constraining structure
formation models).
The power in the CMB anisotropy spectrum towards
small angular scales is expected to be strongly damped: the
spectral cutoﬀ may constrain the ionization history of the
primordial gas andmechanisms for reionization (Dodelson &
Jubas1995). Reionization mayeraseprimaryanisotropies o n
small angular scale; however, via the ‘Vishniac eﬀect’, rei on-
ization may generate secondary ﬂuctuations of signiﬁcant
magnitude (Hu, Scott & Silk 1994). Gravitational lensing
by large-scale structure may also transfer anisotropy powe r
from larger to smaller scales enhancing the amplitude of pri -
mary anisotropies at small scales (Metcalf & Silk 1997). The
time dependence of the gravitational potential during late
non-linear structure formation may imprint anisotopies on
the CMB via the ‘Rees-Sciama eﬀect’ and this may be the
dominant anisotropy on sub-arcminute scales (Seljak 1996) .
Another plausible source for small-angular-scale anisotr opy
is the Sunyaev-Zeldovich eﬀect in the relativistic plasma c o-
coons of radio galaxies (Yamada, Sugiyama & Silk 1999).
Anisotropies in the CMB on arcmin scales could also pro-
vide a powerful constraint on any cosmological magnetic
ﬁeld (Subramanian & Barrow 1998).
If structure forms by the growth of initial small per-
turbations, the CMB anisotropies are expected to be par-
tially polarized. This is because the matter inhomogeneiti es2R. Subrahmanyan et al.
cause the radiation to be anisotropic, and Thomson scatter-
ing of the anisotropic radiation at the last scattering sur-
face generates linear polarization (Bond & Efstathiou 1984 ;
Hu & White 1997). The fractional polarization in the pri-
mary anisotropies is expected to be greater at smaller an-
gular scales and the detection of polarization in the CMB
anisotropies may be a fundamental test of, and provide an
additional observational constraint on theories for struc ture
formation.
The secondary anisotropies result from interactions in
the post-recombination era and during non-linear struc-
ture formation. An important eﬀect here is the Sunyaev-
Zeldovich (S-Z) scattering of the CMB as it encounters hot
gas in the deep potential wells of clusters of galaxies (see
Birkinshaw 1998 for a recent review). The expectations for
the CMB anisotropy arising from this eﬀect are diﬃcult to
compute, and depend on the abundances of dark matter
halos with cluster masses that are formed at diﬀerent cos-
mic epochs, and the processes by which the gas accumu-
lates in these potential wells and is heated. Nevertheless,
using models for the evolution of the intracluster medium
and estimates of the abundances of cluster potentials from
the Press-Schechter formalism or self-similar evolutiona ry
models, distribution functions have been derived for the S-
Z sources and these have been used to estimate the CMB
anisotropies in diﬀerent cosmological models and scenario s
for the evolution of the gas (Bartlett & Silk 1994; Marke-
vitchet al. 1994). Blind surveysfor S-Zclusters are expect ed
to provide valuable inputs to our understanding of the late
stages of structure formation.
A deep radio survey with the VLA in an HST medium
deep surveyﬁeld does appear tohave detected a radio decre-
ment (Richards et al. 1997); independently, a Ryle-telesco pe
observation towards a pair of quasars has also shown a ‘hole’
in the radio sky (Jones et al. 1997). In both cases, follow-up
in the optical and X-ray bands have not revealed any cluster
inthese directions. Because theCompton yparameter which
determines the magnitude of any S-Z decrement towards a
hot-gas cluster is distance independent, the S-Z ﬂux den-
sity (the integrated decrement) may be observable to higher
redshifts as compared tothe optical/X-ray luminosities. T he
absence of luminous counterparts in other bands indicates
that any clusters that may be responsible for the decrements
via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich eﬀect should be at moderately
high redshifts: the existence of collapsed massive structu res
at early epochs deﬁes conventional wisdom (Bartlett, Blan-
chard & Barbosa 1998) and has led to alternate hypotheses
for microwave decrements (Natarajan & Sigurdsson 1999).
In 1990, we commenced a programme to search for
arcmin-scale anisotropies with theAustraliaTelescope Co m-
pact Array (referred to as the ATCA experiment). The ﬁrst
results based on a deep survey of a single ﬁeld were reported
in Subrahmanyan et al. (1993); the sensitivity was improved
with further observations using improved receivers and the
derived upper limits were reported in Subrahmanyan et al.
(1998). We have now used the Australia Telescope to im-
prove the sky area covered and imaged six independent sky
regions with high brightness temperature sensitivity. Our
goal was to make a blind search for any ‘holes’ in the mi-
crowave sky apart from deriving estimates of the arcmin
scale CMB anisotropy in total intensity and polarization. I n
this paper, we present these observations.2 ATCA OBSERVATIONS
The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA; see The
Australia Telescope 1992) is an E-W array with ﬁve 22-m
diameter antennae movable on a railtrack. The best surface
brightnesssensitivityis achievedwhenthearray isin aclo se-
packed conﬁguration and we have conﬁgured the ATCA in
a 122-m array, with the ﬁve antennae equispaced along the
E-W track on stations 30.6 m apart, for these observations.
Inthis conﬁguration, observations at declinations lower t han
−50◦wouldbeshadowedinsome hourangles andshadowing
results in spurious correlations in the baseline pairs invo lv-
ing antennae whose projected areas overlap. The brightness
sensitivity in the observations would progressively decre ase
for ﬁelds at higher declinations because of the increase in
projected baselines at large hour angles. The 22-m antennae
cannot be placed on stations closer than 30.6 m; therefore,
we have made all observations in ﬁelds located about −50◦
in declination so that the projected spacings between adja-
cent antennae would be close to the shadowing limit of 22 m
over a large range of hour angles. The observations would
have the best brightness sensitivity without shadowing re-
lated problems.
Most physical mechanisms for primary anisotropies in
the CMB result in wavelength-independent ﬂuctuations in
the CMB thermodynamic temperature. At centimetre wave-
lengths, where the sky brightness of the 2 .73 K CMB radia-
tion may be approximated by the Rayleigh-Jean’s law, these
CMB brightness temperature ﬂuctuations may be consid-
ered to be wavelength independent. On small angular scales
the dominant cause of CMB temperature anisotropy may be
the S-Z eﬀect: this has a wavelength dependence. However,
for this eﬀect, a fairly constant temperature decrement is
expected at centimetre wavelengths.
The anisotropy power in the CMB sky is usually de-
scribed in terms of Cl’s in multipole l-space, where Cl=/angbracketleft|
Clm|2/angbracketrightandClm’s are the coeﬃcients in the spherical har-
monic expansion of the fractional temperature anisotropy
on the celestial sphere. The anisotropy variance, which is e x-
pected in any diﬀerential measurement of the sky brightness
temperature, and is made with an l-space window function
of octave width, will be about l(l+1)Cl; therefore, the CMB
anisotropy spectrum is usually a plot of l(l+1)Clversusl.
As discussed earlier, the anisotropy power due to primary
anisotropies is expected to cut oﬀ at small angles and con-
sequently on arcmin scales, the expected variance in most
experimental eﬀorts maybe expected tobe lower ifthe eﬀec-
tive beam is smaller. There have been estimates of the CMB
anisotropy spectrum arising from the decrements due to the
thermal S-Z eﬀect in a cosmological distribution of cluster s
containing hot gas; the resulting l(l+ 1)Clis fairly ﬂat in
thel-space regime corresponding to arcmin scales (Molnar
1998).
In any image made with the ATCA in its ultra com-
pact array conﬁguration with the ﬁve22-m antennae located
30.6 mapart along the E-Wtrack, providedtheobservations
are made with same times and using receivers with the same
systemtemperatures, thebrightnesssensitivity( i.e.,therms
noise in the image in units of brightness temperature) would
be independent of observing frequency. Observations made
at higher frequencies would havesmaller beams andthe win-
dow function corresponding to the measurements would beATCA survey for CMB anisotropies 3
located higher up in l-space. Consequently, ATCA observa-
tions made at higher frequencies would be attempting to
make measurements of the CMB spectrum at larger l, but
would be less likely to detect any primary anisotropies. On
the other hand, ATCA observations at all frequencies would
be equally sensitive to ‘ﬂat band’ anisotropies.
The ATCA currently operates in the 20, 13, 6 and 3 cm
wavelength bands; in its ultra-compact conﬁguration, the
images at all these wavelengths would be confusion lim-
ited at levels above those required to detect most CMB
anisotropies. The confusion at these wavelengths arises fr om
unresolvedextragalactic synchrotronsourceswhichtypic ally
have a steep ﬂux-density spectrum with a mean spectral in-
dexα≈ −0.6 (we deﬁne the spectral index by the relation
Sν∼να). These sources have an integral number count that
approximately follows the relation N(> S)∼ν−0.6S−1.2Ω,
whereSis the ﬂux density, νis the observing frequency
and Ω is the beam solid angle. We may assume that the
discrete sources are Poisson random distributed on the sky
and that the rms confusion noise is roughly the ﬂux den-
sity at which we may expect one source in every synthesized
beam. Because the synthesized beam scales as Ω ∼ν−2, we
may expect the rms confusion noise to scale as ∆ S∼ν−2.2.
The brightness temperature scales as T∼S/(Ων2) and
it follows that the rms brightness temperature ‘noise’ on
the image would scale as ∆ T∼ν−2.2. Every octave in-
crease in frequency reduces the confusion noise by a factor
about4.6; therefore, we haveoptedtomake theATCACMB
anisotropy observations in the highest available 3 cm band.
When observing with the ATCA in the ultra compact
122-m array conﬁguration, with ﬁve antennae equi-spaced
30.6-m apart along the E-W railtrack, images made using
just the four 30.6-m baselines — instead of using all ten
baselines — give the highest surface brightness sensitivit y.
Images made using just the four 30.6-m baselines between
adjacent antennae would have an rms thermal noise that is
a factor/radicalbig
10/4 larger, and a synthetic beam that is at least
a factor four larger in solid angle. Because the brightness
temperature sensitivity depends on the rms thermal noise
(inunitsofﬂuxdensityperbeam) andinverselyonthebeam
solid angle, the images made omitting baselines exceeding
30.6 m would have a brightness sensitivity that is at least
a factor 4 //radicalbig
10/4 better. For this reason, the images that
represent the CMB anisotropy search have been constructed
usingthe four 30.6-m baselines alone; images made using the
remaining six baselines exceeding 30.6 m have been used to
derive the foreground discrete source confusion in the ﬁeld s.
As discussed in section 6.1 below, the CMB anisotropy
search using the four 30.6-m baselines is sensitive to
anisotropy power in an l-space window deﬁned by the tele-
scope ﬁlter function. The observations are sensitive to CMB
anisotropy with spatial frequencies that are covered by the
30.6-m baseline and, therefore, the ﬁlterfunction would ha ve
a smaller fractional bandwidth (and appear to be narrower)
in the case of observations closer to the celestial pole wher e
the projected baseline is, on the average, larger. As stated
above, the observations are restricted to declinations sou th
of−50◦to avoid shadowing. Consequently, the brightness
sensitivity of the 30.6-m interferometer, as also the frac-
tional bandwidth covered by the interferometer in l-space,
is a maximum for observations at declination −50◦. For ob-
servations at declination −50◦, the 30.6-m baseline wouldhave a projected baseline close to the dish diameter of 22 m
for a signiﬁcant fraction of the observing time; consequent ly,
the ﬁlter function would not be narrow.
The half power width of the synthesized beam for these
low-resolution images is about 2 arcmin for 3-cm observa-
tions at −50◦declination. This beam size is more or less
right for the detection of S-Z anisotropies due to clusters a t
moderate redshifts.
2.1 Field selection criteria
Four regions were initially selected at about −50◦decli-
nation, where highest-surface-brightness observations w ere
possible in the 122-m array without shadowing. These were
located well oﬀ the Galactic plane. The Molonglo 408 MHz
survey (Large et al. 1981) lists sources with ﬂux densities
exceeding 0.7 Jy at this declination and is believed to be
complete to 1 Jy, the PMN survey at 4.85 GHz (Wright et
al. 1994) lists sources exceeding 40 mJy with 90 per cent
completeness: the selected regions had no listed sources in
either of these catalogues within 30 arcmin of their centres .
There are also no strong sources listed in either of these
catalogues that are in the vicinity of the selected regions.
We have examined the DSS data of the UK Schmidt IIIaJ
plates of these regions to verify that there are no obvious
peculiarities in the optical — no obvious nebulosities, clu s-
ters, or higher than usual star counts. The coordinates of
the centres of the selected regions are in Table 1. Two pairs
of regions were selected that were about 12 hr apart in right
ascension, so that the deep surveys for CMB anisotropies
could be made in 12-hr LST ranges that did not overlap,
and the observations could use the entire time the ATCA
was specially conﬁgured in the 122-m array for the CMB
anisotropy experiment.
These four regions were ﬁrst observed at 20 cm with
the ATCA in its 750 m array conﬁguration. The aim was
to detect weaker confusing sources in the regions for the
purpose of using the images to select a set of small ﬁelds
for deep 3 cm imaging for CMB anisotropy. The observa-
tions were made during November 14-17, 1996, in the 0.75A
conﬁguration and using two 64-MHz wide bands centred at
1344 and 1434 MHz. Visibility measurements over spatial
wavelengths 360–3400 λmay be expected to be sensitive to
confusingsources with angular scales uptoa few arcmin and
these images would be useful in selecting the ﬁelds for CMB
anisotropy searches on arcmin scales. The absolute ﬂux den-
sity scale was set by short observations of PKS 1934 −638
whose ﬂux density was adopted to be 15.01 and 14.83 Jy re-
spectively at 1344 and 1434 MHz. Each region was observed
for about 11 hr using dual linear polarizations; the arcmin
resolution images had rms noise of about 0.17 mJy beam−1
before any correction was made for the attenuation due to
the primary beam.
Sources may be reliably detected in the images with
ﬂux density exceeding about 0.5 mJy beam−1. The ATCA
primary beam has half power width of about 33 arcmin at
21 cm. Adopting an integral source count

The peak and total ﬂux densities at 20 cm are quoted for images not corrected
for the attenuation due to the primary beam.
(1985), regions with 33 arcmin diameter may be expected to
have about 2 sources exceeding 25 mJy. The peak and total
ﬂux densities in the 20 cm images of the individual regions
are also listed in Table 1. No surveyed region has sources
exceeding 25 mJy implying that the four regions surveyed
have relatively moderate numbers of the stronger sources.
The imaging for CMB anisotropies was done in the 3cm
wavelength band where the ATCA primary beam drops to
10 per cent of its peak value at a radial distance of 5 arcmin.
In any region with radius 5 arcmin, about 3 sources may be
expected on the average at 21 cm wavelength with ﬂux den-
sity exceeding 0.5 mJy. We identiﬁed ﬁeld centres within the
four regions surveyed that do not have sources with 21 cm
ﬂux density exceeding about 0.5 mJy within 5 arcmin radii.
Assuming a mean spectral index α=−0.5, the ﬁelds may
not be expected to have sources exceeding about 0.2 mJy
at 8.7 GHz. A short ATCA observation at 8.7 GHz revealed
a>0.5 mJy source in a potential sub-ﬁeld in region A —
an inverted spectrum source — and this ﬁeld centre was
consequently rejected.
A total of six ﬁeld centres were selected for the deep
survey at 8.7 GHz, their coordinate centres are listed in Ta-
ble 2.
2.2 Observing strategy
The strategy adopted was the same as that in previous
ATCA searches for CMB anisotropy (Subrahmanyan et al.
1993; Subrahmanyan et al. 1998). The observations were
made during July 10–29, 1997, in the 122B conﬁguration
of the ATCA. The ﬁve ATCA antennae provided four 31-
m baselines, three 61-m baselines, two 92-m baselines and
one 122-m baseline. All ﬁelds were observed in full Earth-
rotation Fourier-synthesis mode using the E-W array in 12-
hr sessions so as to obtain visibilities along complete elli p-
tical (u,v)-tracks in the spatial frequency domain. Observa-
tions were made in a pair of 128-MHz wide bands centred
at 8640 and 8768 MHz. All four polarization products —
XX, YY, XY and YX — were measured for every antenna
pair between the X and Y orthogonal linearly polarized sig-
nals from each antenna. The visibility data were recorded in
spectral line mode with 32 channels covering the 128 MHz
bands.
The ﬂux density scale was set by short observations of
PKS 1934 −638 made daily; the ﬂux density of this primary
calibrator was adopted to be 2.84 & 2.79 Jy respectively
at 8640 and 8768 MHz. Secondary calibrator sources were
observed in short 3-min scans every 20 min during the ob-
servations. The secondary calibrators and the ﬁelds were
both observed with the antennae pointing at the calibra-Table 2. Fields observed for CMB anisotropies.

tor sources/ﬁeld centres, but with the array phased towards
a sky position oﬀset 2min right ascension and 30 arcmin
in declination. This oﬀset between the pointing and phas-
ing centres is not expected to cause any signiﬁcant visibili ty
amplitude de-correlation within the spectral channels; on
the other hand, systematic errors of various kinds that of-
ten appear at the phase centre in Fourier-synthesis images
would, in our case, be about 36 arcmin from the ﬁeld cen-
tre (pointing centre) and several primary beamwidths away.
The visibility data were time averaged 30 s online.
2.3 Imaging
The visibility data were imaged using the miriaddata re-
duction software.
Because theATCAcorrelator hasaninherenttriangular
weighting for the lag-spectrum in the 128-MHz bandwidth
mode, alternate channels are redundant in the 33-channel
frequency spectrum. Any oﬀsets in the signal sampler levels ,
or coupling of the sampler clock birdies into the RF signal,
are expected to lead to errors in the end channels of the
spectrum, and these may spill-over to the even numbered
channels. For these reasons, we rejected all even numbered
channels and the end channels. We also rejected channels
numbered 3 and 31 because the signal-to-noise ratio was
poor in these channels close to the band edges. A total of
13 useful spectral channels were retained giving an eﬀectiv e
bandwidth of 104 MHz.
The phase centres were changed oﬀ-line tocoincide with
the antenna pointing centres (ﬁeld centres) by appropriate
corrections to the channel visibility phase for the seconda ry
calibrator and ﬁeld data. The complex antenna gains, the
complex spectral response (bandpass) and the polarization
leakages were derived from the secondary calibrator obser-
vations and these were used to calibrate the ﬁeld visibil-
ities. The ﬁeld visibilities were then averaged over the 13
frequency channels and transformed into the four Stokes pa-
rameters.
Images were made from concatenated data bases sepa-
rately for each of the six ﬁelds. No tapering was applied to
the visibility data and the 30-s visibilities were weightedATCA survey for CMB anisotropies 5

pattern is shown as a dotted circle with a 7 arcmin radius.6R. Subrahmanyan et al.
based on the recorded system temperatures to minimize
the image noise. Hereinafter, we refer to images made us-
ing the 30.6-m baseline visibilities (with spatial wavelen gths
less than 1 k λ) and rejecting all spacings other than those
between adjacently located antennae as LR images. Those
images made using exclusively the longer spacings exceedin g
1 kλare referred to as HR images. All images were synthe-
sized with 10 arcsec pixels and 512 pixels a side, the choice
ensured that the synthesized beams were well oversampled
and the total area imaged well exceeded the primary beam
size. While synthesizing each LR and HR image, the cor-
responding synthetic beam pattern images were also made
and these point-spread-function images are referred to as
LR-PSF and HR-PSF images. The images were not decon-
volved.
In Table 2 are listed the total observing time on each of
the six ﬁelds, the harmonic mean time per ﬁeld was 43.6 hr.
The average system temperature of the 3 cm ATCA system
at the observing frequency was about 42 K (Gough 1994).
Given that the observations were made in dual polarization
and in a pair of bands each with an eﬀective bandwidth of
104 MHz, and adopting values of 0.88 for the correlator eﬃ-
ciency and 0.64 for the aperture eﬃciency of the ATCA an-
tennae, it follows that the ‘naturally weighted’ images mad e
using all the 10 baselines would be expected to have an rms
noise of about 15.1 µJy beam−1. The LR images would be
expected to have an rms noise that is a factor/radicalbig
10/4 larger,
i.e., 23.9µJy beam−1, and the HR images would be ex-
pected to have an rms noise that is a factor/radicalbig
10/6 larger,
i.e., 19.5µJy beam−1.
LR images of the six ﬁelds, made in Stokes I, are dis-
played in Fig. 1 as contour images. HR images of these ﬁelds
made in Stokes I are displayed in Fig 2. The images have
not been corrected for the attenuation due to the primary
beam and have not been deconvolved. The primary beam
regions are indicated in the images as dotted circles repre-
senting the location of the ﬁrst null of the primary beams,
these have radii of 7 arcmin. We have derived the weighted
rms intensity in these images by weighting the image pixel
intensities by the value of the primary beam at the pixel
locations. These image rms computed for the individual LR
images and HR images are listed in Table. 3.
Most radio sources in the sky have extremely small, if
any, circular polarization. Therefore, Stokes V images are
expected to be almost entirely thermal noise images. This
noise is uniform over synthesized images and does not follow
any taper due to the primary beam. We have constructed
Stokes-V LR and HR images of the six ﬁelds and computed
the image rms noise over large areas of the individual im-
ages. The rms noise values are listed in Table 3. These
represent our best estimates of the thermal noise compo-
nent of the pixel variances in the images in Fig. 1 and 2.
It may be noted that the mean variance in these Stokes
V images is (24.2 µJy beam−1)2for the LR images and
(19.5µJy beam−1)2for the HR images. These are within 3
per cent of our estimates made above of the thermal noise
based on our knowledge of the telescope parameters.
3 FOREGROUND CONFUSION
Clearly, the image rms in Stokes I exceeds that expected
from thermal noise (the Stokes V image rms values); at leastin the case of the ﬁelds A2, B1, B2 and D1 some part of the
excess variance will be due to the discrete sources seen in
the corresponding HR images.
3.1 Subtracting confusion models
We have developed an algorithm for modelling the discrete
sources in the ﬁelds based on the HR images and used these
to subtract a signiﬁcant part of the confusion. The inputs
to the algorithm are the LR and HR images of any ﬁeld as
well as the corresponding synthetic beams: the LR-PSF and
HR-PSF images.
The algorithm iteratively identiﬁes point-source com-
ponents in residual HR images. Whenever point sources are
to be subtracted from any image, the corresponding syn-
thesized beam (PSF) image, scaled in amplitude to have a
peakequaltothepoint-sourceﬂuxdensityand shiftedin sky
position to the location of the component, is subtracted.
In each iteration, ﬁrst, a residual HR image is made
by subtracting the component list identiﬁed in the previous
iteration. Second, estimates are derived for the rms intens ity
in source-free regions using pixels more than 14 arcmin from
the centre. No further components are added to the model
and the iterations are stopped if
(i) the number of components in the model is six, or
(ii) the peak in the residual HR image <∼four times the
rms in source free areas, or
(iii) theimage rms within 14 arcmin of thecentre is within
10 per cent of the rms in source-free regions and no peak
exceeds 5 times this rms.
New components are added to the component list in each
iteration by locating the peak pixel in the residual HR im-
age within 20 arcmin of the centre. An initial estimate of the
ﬂuxdensityandposition ofthisnewcomponentisderivedby
ﬁtting a 7 ×7-pixel HR-PSF beam patch to a 7 ×7-pixel im-
age patch around the position of the peak. Having updated
the component list with this estimate for the parameters of
the new component, the iteration ends by optimizing all the
component parameters jointly by minimizing the variance
in a residual HR image obtained by subtracting the compo-
nents.
In Table 4, we have listed the components identiﬁed
in the six ﬁelds. It may be noted here that all components
were constrained to be positive, and the estimation of com-
ponent parameters did not use the LR images in any way.
The residual LR and HR images obtained by subtracting
these components are shown in Figs 3 & 4.
The rms of the pixel intensities in the residual LR and
HR images, computed after weighting the pixels by the pri-
mary beam, are also listed in Table 3. It may be noted that
the variance in these residual images are, in every case, in
excess of the variance in the corresponding Stokes V images.
The ﬁeld B1 appears to have a signiﬁcant negative feature
close to the image centre. Visual comparisons between the
residual LR and HR residual images do not show any corre-
spondence in the positions of the peaks in the images.
The variance in the Stokes V images are a measure
of the thermal noise in the images of the various ﬁelds.
We have computed the weighted mean of the variances in
the Stokes I images of the six ﬁelds, separately for the
LR and HR images, using the Stokes V image variancesATCA survey for CMB anisotropies 7

mean variance was (51.7 µJy beam−1)2in the HR and
(117.1µJy beam−1)2for the LR images; after confusion
subtraction, the mean variances were (25.0 µJy beam−1)2
for the HR and (52.0 µJy beam−1)2for the LR images. The
weighted mean thermal noise (Stokes V image variance) is
(19.4µJy beam−1)2for the HR and (24.1 µJy beam−1)2for
the LR images. The ‘excess’ variance is (15.8 µJy beam−1)2
for the HR and (46.1 µJy beam−1)2for the LR images.
3.2 Residual confusion
Windhorst et al. (1993) have derived the radio source counts
atµJy ﬂux densities using deep images made at 8.44 GHz
with the VLA. Adopting a mean spectral index α=−0.5 at
these frequencies, the diﬀerential source counts are
dN
dS= (−5.05±0.80)×10−3S−2.3±0.2
40µJyµJy−1arcmin−2(2)
when scaled to 8.7 GHz. S40µJydenotes the ﬂux density in
units of 40 µJy and the errors in the normalization and in
the index are for a power-law ﬁt that has the ﬂux density S
normalized to 40 µJy.
We have simulated skies with a Poisson random dis-
tribution of faint sources adopting the source counts given
in equation 2 with the nominal values quoted for the nor-
malization and index. Areas of the sky of about 2 arcmin
in diameter, roughly corresponding to the half-power areas
of the synthesized beams of the LR images, would be ex-
pected to have one source on the average exceeding 70 µJy.
In the simulations, sources in the ﬂux density range 0.1–
500µJy were included:because thediﬀerential source countsscale as ( dN/dS)∼S−2.3, the variance contribution from
sources in logarithmic intervals in ﬂux density would scale
asσ2∼S0.7, implying that weak sources below this range
— which may be expected to be present in large numbers
in every synthesized beam — would contribute little to the
image variance. Our ﬁelds are selected to be devoid of strong
sources exceeding 0.5 mJy.
For the simulations, weighted-mean synthesized beam
patterns were computed by combining all the visibilities
(of all the six ﬁelds) and computing LR and HR synthe-
sized beams for the combined data base. In each simulation,
the sources were convolved by these beam patterns to pro-
duce separate LR and HR images. Thermal noise, whose
autocorrelation was consistent with the square of the cor-
responding synthesized beam patterns, and with variance
(19.4µJy beam−1)2for the HR and (24.1 µJy beam−1)2for
the LR images, were added to the simulated images.
The simulated images were processed by the same algo-
rithm, described in section 3.1, to subtract discrete sourc e
confusion. The residual LR images had a mean variance of
(58.8µJy beam−1)2whereas the HR images had a mean
variance of (24.5 µJy beam−1)2. We have grouped the sim-
ulations in lots of six, to simulate our observations of six
independent ﬁelds, and computed the mean residual vari-
ance in the groups of six ﬁelds. Their distribution implies
that the observed rms pixel intensity, when computed as
an average over six residual LR ﬁelds, may be expected to
have a±1-σspread of 50.8–65.8 µJy beam−1. The corre-
sponding ±1-σspread in the HR image rms values is 23.2–
25.6µJy beam−1. The observed values of the rms pixel in-
tensity as computed from the residual LR and HR images
are 52.0 µJy beam−1and 25.0 µJy beam−1and lie within
the expected ±1-σspreads.
The conclusion we make from the simulations is that
the ‘excess’ variance we observe in the LR as well as HR
images, after subtracting the derived confusion models, is
consistent with the ‘excess’ expected from undetected weak
sources. All of the ‘excess’ variance may be attributed to
unsubtracted confusion.
4 FIELD B1
The residual image of ﬁeld B1, in Fig. 3, shows a sig-
niﬁcant negative close to the ﬁeld centre. A ﬁt to the LR
visibility data yields a value of −202µJy and a position
oﬀset−17′′in RA and −28′′in Dec from the ﬁeld centre.
The peak of the negative feature is a factor 7.5 times the
rms thermal noise. The corresponding residual HR image ofATCA survey for CMB anisotropies 9

Field B1, shown in Fig. 4, shows no evidence for any nega-
tive at this sky position: the HR image value at the position
of the negative (in the LR image) is 70 µJy beam−1.
It may be noted here that the negative peak in the LR
image of the residual B1 ﬁeld (Fig. 3) does not appear to
have the sidelobe pattern expected for an unresolved nega-
tive source: this means that either the negative source has
structure on this scale or that the negative arises from a
chance superposition of negative sidelobes of weak confus-
ing sources in the ﬁeld.
With the aim of examining the reality of this fea-
ture, we made a separate observation of the ﬁeld with the
ATCA antennae pointed towards position RA(J2000) =
01h43m37.s36, Dec.(J2000) = −50◦58′27.′′33. This ﬁeld
centre was oﬀset 2 .′2 (−127′′in RA and −32′′in Dec) from
the previous pointing centre. We refer to this ﬁeld centre
as B1OFFSET. The 253 µJy source detected in the HR
image of the B1 ﬁeld is now 3.2 arcmin from the ﬁeld cen-
tre and may be expected to appear in the HR image of the
B1OFFSET ﬁeld with a ﬂux density of 120 µJy. Because
the shift corresponds to about 40 per cent of the primary
beam FWHM, we may expect a signiﬁcant change in the im-
age ﬂuctuations that arise from the numerous weak sources
in the sky. The position of the negative peak, which was seen
in the residual B1 image, should now be 1.8 arcmin from the
new ﬁeld centre. Correcting for the attenuation due to the
primary beam, we may expect the negative to appear with
a value−159µJy beam−1.
We display HR and LR images of the B1 OFFSET ﬁeld
in Fig. 5. No sources have been subtracted from these im-
ages. The rms thermal noise is 53 µJy beam−1in the LR
image and 42 µJy beam−1in the HR image as estimated
from the corresponding Stokes V images. At the position in
the HR image, where we expect a 120 µJy source, the pixel
intensity is 73 µJy beam−1. At the position of the possible
decrement (indicated by the star symbol in Fig. 5), the pixel
intensity is −45µJy beam−1. The negative is not seen at the2σlevel.
We have examined the residual LR images created by
our simulations to infer the decrements that may be ex-
pected from the negative sidelobes of residual unsubtracte d
positive confusing sources in the ﬁelds. We ﬁnd that one in
six ﬁelds may be expected to have a decrement exceeding
−250µJy beam−1. A decrement of the magnitude observed
in Field B1, which is −206µJy beam−1, may be expected in
35 per cent of the observed ﬁelds. The simulations indicate
that the observed decrement in B1 may well be owing to
residual confusion.
Because the B1 OFFSET image has not conﬁrmed the
decrement, and because the decrement in the B1 ﬁeld does
not have the sidelobe structure expected, we are led to ques-
tion the reality of the decrement. We hypothesize that the
decrement probably arises as a result of (i) weak confusion
in the LR B1 image, and (ii) as a result of errors in the pa-
rameter estimates of the strong confusing source seen in the
HR image of ﬁeld B1: these errors may be due to confusion
in the HR image.

using images that have been corrected for the attenuation12R. Subrahmanyan et al.

due to the primary beam. These values for the peak decre-
ments may be considered limits on the magnitude of any
decrements in the ﬁelds for comparisons with models pre-
dicting S-Z source counts in blank sky regions.
It may be noted here that the peak decrements listed in
Table 5 for the ﬁelds A2, D1 and, in particular, B2 appear
similar to the decrement listed for ﬁeld B1. However, the
peak decrements seen in the A2, D1 and B2 ﬁelds are all
located almost 3 arcmin from the ﬁeld centres and appear
(in images prior to corrections for the attenuation due to th e
primary beam) at levels less than 4 times the thermal rms
noise. On the other hand, the decrement in the B1 ﬁeld is
seen at a level 7.5 times the rms thermal noise and is located
0.5 arcmin from the ﬁeld centre.
The sky area searched for decrements, in Table 5, is six
ﬁelds of size 3 arcmin in radius, corresponding to a total of
0.05 degrees2. The limit to the magnitude of decrements in
this sky area is about 0.2 mJy at 8.7 GHz.
The Sunyaev-Zeldovich decrement in the CMB bright-
ness temperature has been detected along the lines of sight
to several clusters of galaxies (see Birkinshaw 1998 for a
recent review). For example, an interferometric image of
the high-redshift cluster CL 0016+16 ( z= 0.541) with a
beam of arcmin size showed a decrement corresponding to
−426µK, at lower redshifts, Abell 773has been seen toshow
a−312µK dip (Carlstrom, Joy & Grego 1996). The S-Z
decrements detected towards clusters of galaxies in target -
ted observations have yielded central decrements of severa l
hundred µK. The decrement observed along lines of sight
through the centre of a cluster depends on the integral of
the thermal gas pressure along the path and is independent
of the distance to the cluster; therefore, it is unlikely tha t
any rich cluster of galaxies lies in the surveyed region.
Several authors have estimated the CMB anisotropies
caused by cosmological populations of clusters of galaxies
(Markevitch et al. 1994; Bartlett & Silk 1994; Barbosa et al.
1996). Bartlett et al. (1998) estimate the S-Z source counts
at 0.75 mm wavelength adopting the Press-Schechter for-
malism for the mass function and normalizing the matter
density power spectrum to the present day cluster abun-
dances as measured by the X-ray temperature distribution
function. The limit from the ATCA observations translates
to a limit of 30 mJy ﬂux density at 0.75 mm wavelength. In
an Ω0= 1 universe, we may expect about 0.1 sources in the
ATCA survey region; in an Ω 0= 0.2 universe the expecta-
tion is about 1 source. The ATCA survey places constraints
on models with Ω 0<0.2.Two separate interferometric images made of sky re-
gions devoid of obvious clusters appear to have detected
decrements.Jones et al. (1997) report a −410µJy integrated
decrement in a Ryle-telescope (RT) image, containing a pair
of quasars, made with a 110′′×175′′beam at a frequency of
15 GHz. A second ﬁeld showed no decrement. These corre-
spond to one ∼20 mJy S-Z source at 0.75 mm wavelength
in 0.034 degree2sky area. Richards et al. (1997) report a
−27µJy integrated ﬂux density feature in their 30′′resolu-
tion Very-large-array (VLA) images at 8.4 GHz. A separate
VLA ﬁeld observed previously showed no such decrement.
TheVLAresults correspond toone 4mJy source at 0.75 mm
in a sky area of 0.018 degree2. These limits, as well as re-
sults from the SuZIE (Church et al. 1997) and and OVRO
RING experiments (Myers et al. 1993) are compared with
the expected S-Z source counts by Bartlett et al. (1998).
The constraints imposed on the source counts by the
ATCA survey are the same as those inferred from the other
experiments. It may be noted, however, that (i) the ATCA
survey region considerably exceeds the sky areas covered
in the other interferometric imaging surveys, and (ii) the
ATCA survey is truly a ‘blank ﬁeld’ search as against the
RT images which were made towards ﬁelds known to have
quasars. We would also like to point out that the residual
variance in the ﬁelds are dominated by, and consistent with,
the expectations from residual unsubtracted confusion: co n-
straining the S-Z source counts to be limited to the allowed
residual variance, after accounting for the variance from
weak unsubtracted confusion, will be expected to provide
better limits on S-Z sources and hence on allowed cosmolog-
ical models.
6 GAUSSIAN-FORM CMB ANISOTROPIES
Some CMB anisotropies may be modelled as being Gaus-
sian random in their temperature distribution. As discusse d
earlier, these anisotropies are usually (and completely) d e-
scribed by the power spectrum which is the distribution of
l(l+ 1)Clinl-space. The complex spectral amplitudes at
diﬀerent multipole orders are assumed to be random phase
and the ﬂuctuations on diﬀerent scales are assumed to be
uncorrelated.
Assuming further that the anisotropy spectrum is ﬂat
implies that l(l+1)Clis a constant in l-space. The spectrum
is then completely speciﬁed by its normalization which may
be parametrized as
l(l+1)Cl=/parenleftBig24π

The ﬂat-spectrum CMB anisotropy results in a sky variance
given by

The normalization Qflatis referred to as the quadrupole
normalization because (∆ T)2= (Qflat)2forl= 2 implying
thatQflatis the rms of the quadrupole anisotropy.

pendix A of Subrahmanyan et al. (1998), the TFFs vary
across the synthesized image and may be computed at any
image pixelposition ( θ◦,φ◦)fromthe‘productbeam’ b(θ,φ),
which is the product of the primary beam centred at the an-
tenna pointing centre and the synthesized beam centred at
(θ◦,φ◦). The TFF is given by

The skyvariance was estimated as aweightedaverage of
the variances in the six LR residual images; the weights used
were inversely proportional to the thermal-noise variance s.
Therefore, the synthesized beam used in the computation of
the TFF was obtained by concatenating all the LR data and
constructing a synthesized beam pattern by weighting the
data based on the system temperatures recorded along with
the individual visibility measurements. Because the rms in
theindividualimages were computedbyweightingthepixels
using the primary-beam pattern, the TFFs computed at dif-
ferent image pixel positions were averaged using the square d
primary-beam pattern as weights. The resulting ATCA TFF
is shown in Fig. 6. The ﬁlter function Flpeaks at l= 4900and has half-maximum values at l= 3520 and 6200. Sum-

It may be noted here that the aperture illumination
of the ATCA antenna — apart from the visibility-domain
(u,v)-track of the 30.6 m baseline — determines the shape
of the TFF proﬁle. We have modelled the primary-beam
pattern in the aperture domain taking into account the cen-
tral blockage of the Cassegrain optics and a radial aperture
illumination proﬁle. The parameters were determined from
measurements of the beam pattern.
6.2 Polarized CMB anisotropies
The visibility data on the six ﬁelds have been used to
construct LR images in Stokes Q and U in a search for po-
larized anisotropies on arcmin scales. The image rms were
computed separately for the six ﬁelds after weighting the
image intensities by the antenna primary-beam pattern and
these values are listed in Table 6. As discussed earlier, the
expected image rms due to thermal noise may be derived
from the corresponding Stokes V images and these values
are also listed in the table for comparison.
We have used the thermal-noise variances (variance in
thecorresponding Stokes V images) as weighting factors and
computed the mean variance in the Stokes Q images to be
(22.2µJy beam−1)2and that in the Stokes U images to be
(21.8µJy beam−1)2. The weighted-mean thermal noise is
24.1µJy beam−1. There does not appear to be any ‘excess’
variance in the polarized intensity images.
Examining the images without any correction for the
primary-beam attenuation, the image intensities within
the main lobes of the primary beams (within 7 arcmin
of the image centres) are seen to be in the range +86–
−81µJy beam−1. Simulations of LR images that contain
exclusively a thermal-noise variance of 24 .1µJy beam−1re-
veals that the image intensities may be expected to span
the range ±82µJy beam−1in any random sample contain-
ing 12 images. We conclude that the Stokes Q and U images
of the six ﬁelds do not contain any features apart from those
expected due to thermal noise.
Following the procedure described in Subrahmanyan et
al. (1998), we have simulated sky images assuming that the
sky is devoid of sources — this is probably a reasonable as-
sumption for the Stokes Q and U images — and contains
only ﬂat-spectrum CMB variance. The polarized intensity
LR images may be assumed to have contributions from ther-
mal noise and any polarized CMB ﬂuctuations: because the
ﬂuctuations owing to these two contributors would be un-
correlated, we have separately simulated images containin g
CMB ﬂuctuations and thermal noise. Variance estimates are
derived from the simulations — separately for the thermal
noise and CMB contributions — in the same fashion as for14R. Subrahmanyan et al.

the observations: primary-beam weighted rms is derived for
each simulated image and the average variance is computed
for sets of six images. In Fig. 7 we show the probability
distributions for the variance contributions as inferred f rom
the simulations; the CMB anisotropy has been assumed to
haveQflat= 16µK and the thermal noise in the LR images
is assumed to have an rms of 24.1 µJy beam−1. It may be
noted here that these distribution functions do not follow
a simple chi-square functional form because the image vari-
ances have been estimated as a weighted sum of the squares
of the pixel intensities. The mean variance in the simulated
CMB-anisotropy images is (13 .6µJy beam−1)2and this is
consistent with that expected from the derived ATCA TFF
(equation 10). The convolution of the two distribution func -
tions — one for exclusively CMB anisotropy and the other
corresponding to purely thermal noise — gives the distri-
bution expected for the observed images and this is alsoshown in Fig. 7. The result of the convolution represents the
likelihood of observing any variance value assuming CMB
anisotropy with Qflat= 16µK.

IH2that the CMB anisotropy has a ﬂat-band power Qflat
in addition to the expected thermal noise, the likelihood
function IP( σ2
obs|Qflat) gives the probability distribution
of the observed variance. For the particular case of Qflat=
16µK, this likelihood function is given by the continuous
curve in Fig. 7.
The decision variance is the observed variance σ2
obs. If
we make the hypothesis IH 2that the CMB anisotropy has a
ﬂat-band power exceeding Qflat, the probability of rejecting
this hypothesis when it is true is given by the integral of
the likelihood function IP( σ2
obs|Qflat) up to the decision
variance σ2
obs. This integral is referred to as the size αof the
test of hypothesis IH 2; 1−αis the conﬁdence with which the
observations with variance σ2
obsreject the hypothesis. The
probability of accepting the hypothesis IH 2when the null
hypothesis IH 1is true deﬁnes the quantity 1 −β, whereβis
referred to as the power of the test.
The observed variance in Stokes Q and U are less than
the expected variance from thermal noise. If we adopt the

decision variance to reject hypotheses, the tests will have
powersβ <0.5. If choose to adopt the thermal-noise vari-
ance of (24 .1µJy beam−1)2as the decision variance; this
will yield tests with power β= 0.5. With this choice, we
reject the hypothesis that Qflatexceeds 16 µK with 95 per
cent conﬁdence. Adopting, instead, the observed Stokes Q
variance of (22 .2µJy beam−1)2as the decision variance, we
conclude that Qflat<11µK with 95 per cent conﬁdence;
this test has a power β= 0.23. The corresponding limit
based on the observed variance of (21 .8µJy beam−1)2in
Stokes U is Qflat<10µK with 95 per cent conﬁdence and
powerβ= 0.17.
6.3 Limits on ﬂat-band total-intensity anisotropy
We derive limits on ﬂat-band CMB anisotropies in total in-
tensity from the LR images of the six surveyed ﬁelds. The
residual images, shown in Fig. 3, are expectedtohavecontri -
butions from (i) the telescope thermal noise, (ii) ﬂuctuati ons
due to residual unsubtracted weak sources in the ﬁelds and
(iii) any CMB anisotropy. The weighted mean of the vari-
ances in the six residual LR Stokes I images was derived
to be (52.0 µJy beam−1)2. As discussed earlier, the tele-
scope thermal noise variance contribution is estimated to
be (24.1 µJy beam−1)2from the LR Stokes V images and,
therefore, there is a signiﬁcant variance in the observed im -
ages apart from the thermal noise.
The simulations of discrete-source confusion, discussed
in section 3.2, indicated that if we adopt the nominal source
counts given in equation 2, the residual images may be ex-
pected to have a variance of (59 ±8µJy beam−1)2owingto thermal noise and the unsubtracted confusion. This is
consistent with the observed variance in the residual image s
and we conclude that there is no evidence in the LR images
for any CMB anisotropy contribution.
It may also be noted that the HR residual images
also have a signiﬁcant variance in excess of the expected
thermal noise — (25.0 µJy beam−1)2as compared to the
(19.4µJy beam−1)2thermal noise contribution — and this
is also consistent with the simulations which predict a vari -
ance(24.4±1.2µJy beam−1)2for the combinedcontribution
from thermal noise and residual confusion.
We assume that the sky ﬂuctuations due to any CMB
anisotropy is uncorrelated with the ﬂuctuations due to ther -
mal noise and residual confusion. The simulations describe d
in section 3.2, which provided random samples of images
containing the expected contributions from thermal noise
and residual confusion, were used to derive the expected
distribution of image variance conditional on Qflat= 0.
This distribution, IP( σ2
obs|0), is shown as the dotted line
in Fig. 8 and represents the likelihood function for the null
hypothesis IH 1. The distribution function for the image vari-
ance contribution from a ﬂat-band CMB anisotropy with
Qflat= 28µK is shown in Fig. 8 as a dashed line. The
convolution of the two yields the continuous line in the ﬁg-
ure and represents the likelihood function IP( σ2
obs|Qflat)
for the particular assumption that Qflat= 28µK. The ob-
served variance in the Stokes I images, (52.0 µJy beam−1)2,
rejects the hypothesis that Qflatexceeds 28 µK with 95 per
cent conﬁdence.
The LR images, before any confusion subtraction, have
anrms thatexceedsthethermal noise rms byafactor almost16R. Subrahmanyan et al.
5. After subtracting the confusion models, the residual LR
images are still confusion limited with an rms that is a facto r
about 2 higher than the thermal noise. Therefore, the esti-
mation of any CMB anisotropy contribution in the residual
images is critically dependent on our knowledge of, and un-
certainties associated with, the source counts at the 10- µJy
level. Overestimations ofthesource-countnormalization will
result in spuriously low limits on any CMB anisotropy. How-
ever, we do not believe we have overestimated the expected
discrete source counts because (i) the variance in the resid -
ual HR images exceeds the expected variance by 0 .5σand
(ii) the source counts derived by Partridge et al. (1997) in
independent observations nominally exceeds the counts we
have adopted here at the 10 −µJy ﬂux density level.
We have incorporated the uncertainties in the normal-
ization and index of the diﬀerential source counts by sim-
ulating ﬁelds with Gaussian random choices of parameters
for thesource counts;weadopt1-standard-deviationsprea ds
fortheparameterscorrespondingtotheuncertaintiesquot ed
in equation 2. These simulations show, as may be expected,
a 12 per cent increase in the standard deviation of image
variances; however, the mean image variance is biased to a
larger value: (60.5 µJy beam−1)2. Using this distribution as
the likelihood function IP( σ2
obs|0) of the null hypothesis,
and adopting the observed variance of (52.0 µJy beam−1)2
as the decision variance, we ﬁnd that the observations rule
out ﬂat-band CMB anisotropy with Qflat>25µK with 95
per cent conﬁdence.
6.4 Discussion
The 4-year COBE observations of CMB anisotropy (Ben-
nett et al. 1996) correspond to a ﬂat-band spectral power
ofQflat= 18µK in the multipole range 2 <∼l<∼20. Sev-
eral experiments measuring anisotropies in l-space windows
with centres located at multipoles up to a few hundred have
reported detections corresponding to much greater spectra l
powers (see the website
www.sns.ias.edu/ ∼max/cmb/experiments.html
maintainedbyMaxTegmarkforacompilation ofexperimen-
tal results). For example, therecent PythonV results (Cobl e
et al. 1999) report band powers rising from Qflat= 15 to
63µK over the multipole range l= 50 to 200.
At multipoles exceeding l∼103, there are no reports to
date of the detection of Gaussian anisotropies in the CMB;
observations have, however, detected isolated ‘holes’ in t he
CMB towards clusters of galaxies. As discussed earlier, the
tentative detections of ‘holes’ in ‘blank ﬁelds’ are also pr e-
sumably owing to the S-Z eﬀect in distant clusters. The
SuZIE experiment (Ganga et al. 1997) limit Qflat<27µK
at the 2- σlevel in the multipole window l= 1330–3670.
Ryle telescope observations of the Lynx 2 ﬁeld (Jones 1998)
limitQflat<12µK, or ∆ T/T < 6.6×10−6, in the
window 4300 < l < 8300 with 67 per cent conﬁdence.
The OVRO NCP experiment (Readhead et al. 1989) limit
∆T/T <1.7×10−5at an angular scale of 2 arcmin. VLA
images at 8.7 GHz limit ∆ T/T <2.0×10−5at an angular
scale of 1 arcmin (Partridge et al. 1997). The VLA images
also limit the sky anisotropy in linearly polarized intensi ty
to ∆T/T <1.0×10−5on the 1-arcmin scale.
The ATCA observations reported here cover six in-
dependent regions with a combined sky area of about0.05 degrees2. The images limit the CMB anisotropy in the
multipole range l= 3520–6200 to Qflat<25µK in total in-
tensity and 10 µK in linearly polarized ﬂuctuations. These
correspond to upper limits of (∆ T/T)<6×10−6in linearly
polarized intensity and <1.4×10−5in total intensity for
ﬂuctuations with an angular scale of 2 arcmin. The limits
on polarized intensity ﬂuctuations are the best to date; the
limits on total intensity ﬂuctuations are comparable to tho se
set by other experiments on arcmin scale. These results are
animprovementovertheresultspublishedinSubrahmanyan
et al. (1998) in that the inevitable confusion variance cont ri-
bution to arcmin-scale sky ﬂuctuations at 8.7 GHz has now
been accounted for. The small-angle anisotropy experiment s
have consistently set limits that clearly establish the dow n-
turn in the CMB anisotropy spectrum between l∼102and
103.
7 CONCLUSIONS
We have made sensitive observations of six ‘blank’ ﬁelds
with the aim of examining the arcmin scale anisotropy in the
CMB. After subtracting confusion models derived by higher
resolution data, the residual images are consistent with th e
expected thermal noise and residual confusion from weak
undetected sources. We do not believe we have detected any
S-Zdecrementsintheblankﬁelds.Thisdatabaseisusefulfo r
deriving constraints (i) on the gas in cosmological distrib u-
tions of clusters of galaxies, and (ii) on the CMB anisotropy
power spectrum in total intensityand polarization at arcmi n
scales.
The variance in theimages at 8.7GHz is consistent with
the expectations from thermal noise and the source counts
atµJy ﬂux densitylevels derived byWindhorst et al. (1993).
Assuming Gaussian-form CMB anisotropy with a ‘ﬂat’
spectrum, we derive 95 per cent conﬁdence upper limits of
Qflat<10–11µK in polarized intensity and Qflat<25µK
in total intensity. These correspond to upper limits on
(∆T/TCMB) of 5.7–6 .2×10−6in polarized intensity and
1.4×10−5in total intensity, where TCMB= 2.73 K and
∆T= [l(l+1)Cl/2π]1
2. The ATCA ﬁlter function peaks at
l= 4700 and has half maximum values at l= 3350 and
6050.
The ATCA observations are confusion limited and im-
provements in detection capability require observations a t
higher frequencies where the confusion is less. The ATCA
is currently being upgraded to operate in the 16–25 GHz
band and a north spur is being added to the railtrack to
allow 2-dimensional close-packed array conﬁgurations. As
discussed in section 2, we expect the confusion noise to re-
duce as ∆ S∼ν−2.2, and observations at 18 GHz would
have a confusion rms noise reduced by a factor 5 as com-
pared to the current observations at 8.7 GHz. The angu-
lar scale of the imaging would be reduced by a factor 2 to
about 1 arcmin. High-brightness-sensitive observations w ith
an ultra-compact ATCA at 18 GHz may improve limits on
CMB anisotropyonarcmin scales. Inparticular, theupgrade
would be useful in resolving the sub-structure in the X-ray
gas of high-redshift clusters — detected in future blank-ﬁe ld
S-Z surveys — by imaging their S-Z decrement.
