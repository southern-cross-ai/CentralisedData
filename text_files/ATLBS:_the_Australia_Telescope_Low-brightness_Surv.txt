ABSTRACT
We present a radio survey carried out with the Australia Telescope C ompact Array.
A motivation for the survey was to make a complete inventory of the diﬀuse emission
components as a step towardsa study of the cosmic evolution in rad iosource structure
and the contribution from radio-mode feedback on galaxy evolution . The Australia
Telescope low-brightness survey (ATLBS) at 1388 MHz covers 8.42 deg2of the sky
in an observing mode designed to yield images with exceptional surfac e brightness
sensitivity and low confusion. The survey was carried out in two adja cent regions
on the sky centred at RA: 00h35m00s, DEC:−67◦00′00′′and RA: 00h59m17s,
DEC:−67◦00′00′′(J2000.0). The ATLBS radio images, made with 0.08 mJy beam−1
rms noise and 50′′beam, detect a total of 1094 sources with peak ﬂux exceeding
0.4 mJy beam−1. The ATLBS source counts were corrected for blending, noise bias ,
resolution, and primary beam attenuation; the normalized diﬀerent ial source counts
areconsistent with noupturn downto 0.6mJy.The percentageinte gratedpolarization
Π0was computed after corrections for the polarization bias in integra ted polarized
intensity; Π 0shows an increasing trend with decreasing ﬂux density. Simultaneou s
visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images, with 5′′beam,
of compact components in sources detected in the survey. The ob servations provide a
measurementofthe complexity and diﬀuse emissionassociatedwith m Jy and sub-mJy
radio sources. 10% of the ATLBS sources have more than half of th eir ﬂux density in
extended emission and the fractional ﬂux in diﬀuse components doe s not appear to
vary with ﬂux density, although the percentage of sources that h ave complex structure
increases with ﬂux density. The observations are consistent with a transition in the
natureofextendedradiosourcesfromFR- iiradiosourcemorphology,whichdominates
the mJy population, to FR- istructure at sub-mJy ﬂux density.

1 INTRODUCTION
Our understanding of galaxy evolution across cosmic time
depends on multi-wavelength data, which are products of
ultra-deep surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum th at
have been made using the most sensitive observatories in op-
eration. Instrument design constraints and resource limit a-
tionsusuallyleadtosurveystrategies thatrangefromall- sky
surveys with low angular resolution and sensitivity to ultr a-
deep surveys of small sky regions that are made with high
angular resolution; diﬀerent survey strategies address di ﬀer-
ent components of source populations and diﬀerent aspects
of galaxy evolution.
The radio component of these multi-wavelength cam-
⋆email: rsubrahm@rri.res.inpaigns that target small sky regions has most often been
done using interferometer telescopes conﬁgured to give im-
ages with sub-arcsec resolution that are comparable to or
better than the corresponding optical surveys. These ra-
dio surveys usually have extremely good ﬂux sensitivity and
are capable of detecting µJy emission from distant galaxies.
However, Fourier synthesis imaging that is done with widely
spaced interferometer elements—in order toimage with high
angular resolution—tend to lack surface brightness sensit iv-
ity, which is the ability to detect faint extended emission
components. This is partly due to missing short spacings,
which implies missing information on extended emission,
and partly because of incomplete visibility coverage, whic h
results in increased confusion. Furthermore, imaging with
an interferometer array that has complete visibility cover -
age will still have less (redundant) short spacings than a
c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS2Subrahmanyan, Ekers, Saripalli & Sadler
ﬁlled aperture and hence less sensitivity to extended struc -
ture. Consequently, the ultra-deep radio images might fail
to reproduce extended emission components associated with
galaxies, although extremely faint compact components are
represented in the images.
The normalized diﬀerential radio source counts are ob-
served to show an upturn below ﬂux density of about 1 mJy
(Windhorst et al. 2005) indicating a rapid increase in the
number of faint sources at these ﬂux density levels, which
might constitute a new population. The bulk of these faint
radio sources in the 0.1–1 mJy range in ﬂuxdensityare iden-
tiﬁed with early type galaxies (Mainieri et al. 2008), with
radio structure believed to be of the FR- i(Fanaroﬀ & Riley
1974) type (Padovani et al. 2007), which often have associ-
ated extended emission components. Therefore a complete
census of the radio emission associated with faint galaxies ,
at these ﬂux density levels and at intermediate redshifts of
z= 1–2, requires imaging with good surface brightness sen-
sitivity. Additionally, the radio morphology of the relati vely
lower surface brightness extended emission is a clue to the
nature of the radio source and is a means of distinguishing
between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of diﬀerent classes.
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA1) has the potential
to detect AGNs, including the radio quiet population, out to
redshiftz≈6.AscomparedtoX-rayandoptical surveys,ra-
dio imaging with the next generation telescopes are likely t o
become the instrument of choice for identifying high redshi ft
AGNs, in particular the obscured AGNs (Jarvis & Rawlings
2004). In this context, it is important to quantify the expec -
tations for radio source confusion from both compact and
extended radio source components at faint ﬂux density lev-
els as this is a potential limitation to imaging with sub- µJy
sensitivity. A characterization of the radio sky at faint ﬂu x
density—in total intensity and polarization—is a useful in -
put to simulations of the radio sky and optimization of SKA
array conﬁgurations as well as observing strategies.
The survey presented here has been made with the
speciﬁc goal of providing a view of the low surface bright-
ness radio emission associated with mJy and sub-mJy radio
sources, to provide a database for their characterization, as-
sessment of the cosmic evolution of extended radio compo-
nents and their inﬂuence on galaxy evolution. The surface
brightness sensitivity of this survey, which we refer to as
the Australia Telescope Low-Brightness Survey (ATLBS), is
about a factor of ﬁve better than any previous survey with
comparable resolution (Subrahmanyan et al. 2007). In this
ﬁrst paper we present the ATLBS survey together with the
source countsandapopulation studyoftheradiostructures .
Forthcoming papers will present detailed radio structures ,
optical identiﬁcations, polarization analysis, and explo re in
depth the open problems like, for example, cosmic evolution
of low power radio galaxies, evolution of the radio source
structure with cosmic epoch and the role of kinetic-mode
feedback from AGNs on galaxy environment andgalaxy evo-
lution, where progress depends on our understanding of the
low surface brightness radio sky.

Deep surveys that target weak extended emission compo-
nents and attempt to get close to the confusion limit re-
quire good control of systematics. Interferometers are pre -
ferred over single-dish scanning surveys because of the in-
herent insensitivity to the mean sky background and, conse-
quently, the vastly superior stability in the zero-point le vel
that is achievable in images constructed using Fourier syn-
thesis techniques.
Extended radio sources usually have steep spectral in-
dices and, therefore, it has often been argued that surveys
for the detection of low surface brightness sources ought to
be made at relatively low radio frequencies. While this argu -
ment is correct, there are practical issues that merit consi d-
eration. At frequencies below about 1 GHz, elements form-
ing interferometer telesopes often have poorly deﬁned ﬁeld s
of view (primary beams), relatively larger sidelobe levels ,
and confusion arising from radio sources limits the attain-
able dynamic range. Additionally, the ionosphere introduc es
time-varying phase errors that are diﬃcult to calibrate and
correct. The available bandwidth is also limited at low fre-
quencies. For these reasons, the optimum frequency for deep
surveyswithhighsurface brightnessovermoderate skyarea s
is perhapsaround1GHztoday,andmightmovetolower fre-
quencies as technology and calibration algorithms relevan t
for wide-ﬁeld imaging at low radio frequencies improve.
High ﬁdelity surveys for extended sources with low sur-
face brightness requires good spatial frequency coverage.
Holes in the visibility plane—the uv-coverage—eﬀectively
reduces the number of independent synthesized beam areas
within the primary beam and, consequently, sidelobe confu-
sion due to discrete sources limits the image dynamic range
and quality. Most 2D Fourier synthesis imaging arrays like,
for example, theVeryLarge Array(VLA)andtheGiant Me-
trewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) have array conﬁgurations
optimized for imaging performance in snap-shot mode and
in cases where most of the sky region imaged is empty. The
deconvolution algorithms implemented in software package s
used in processing the data from such arrays also implicitly
assume that most of the sky is empty. However, deep sur-
veys that attempt to get close to sidelobe-confusion limits
require ﬁlled uv-coverage and this motivation has led us to
use the EW Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
for the observations presented here.
The ATCA has ﬁve movable antennas on a 3-km EW
railtrack. We have used the array to image ﬁelds using
four 750-m array conﬁgurations—the 750A, 750B, 750C and
750D arrays. Together, they provide 4 ×10 = 40 baselines
and because the ATCA antennas are 22 m in diameter, the
40 spacings provide a nearly complete coverage over the 0–
750 m range. At the 750-m baseline, Earth rotation would
move the visibility measurement point through a spatial
wavelength corresponding to the antenna diameter in about
7 min. Therefore, the observing strategy was to mosaic im-
age 19 distinct antenna pointing positions during a single
observing session of 12 hr, cycling through all the pointing
positions and observing each for 20 sec so that all the 19 po-
sitions would be re-visited once every 7 min. This ensured
that the elliptic uv-tracks have complete azimuthal coverage
for each pointing. Observations with the ATCA were made
using the 20-cm band.

The 19 pointing positions observed during any observ-
ing session were arranged to tile the sky in a hexagonal pat-
ternsoastocovertheskywithasmaller numberofpointings
compared to a square grid. In the 20-cm band, the ATCA
antenna primary beam has a full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of about 35′, and mosaic imaging of large angu-
lar scale extended structure requires a sky plane ‘Nyquist’
sampling interval of 19 .′5. However, we have adopted to sur-
vey the sky as a collage of individual image tiles without
attempting to image structure on the scale of the primary
beam or greater; therefore, the hexagonal-packed adjacent
pointings are spaced 28 .′6 and this spacing is suﬃcient to
cover thesky with fairly uniform sensitivity. The sequence in
which the pointings were observed was selected to minimize
time lost while the telescope cycled through the pointings.
3 THE MOSAIC OBSERVATIONS
Since our observations use the ATCA with antennas on EW
baselines, the survey region was constrained to be at high
southern declinations and far from the equator, in order to
image with close to circular synthesized beams. High south-
ern declinations are also preferred so that the ﬁelds might b e
far from the Sun, and Solar interference would be minimized
at epochs when the ﬁelds are scheduled for day-time observ-
ing. To avoid shadowing at the shortest 30-m baseline, the
ﬁeld centres had to be south of −50◦declination. On the
other hand, since follow-up optical observing with existin g
southern telescopes are important for the science goals, lo w
declinations were preferred so that optical observing coul d
be through low airmass. Since the ATCA is located at a
latitude of −30◦, regions at very high southern declinations
were avoided so that the survey might be made at reason-
ably high telescope elevations, avoiding problems that mig ht
arise from ground spillover in the antenna radiation patter n.
High Galactic latitudes were preferred since the backgroun d
sky brightness and hence the system temperature would be
lower.
A 10% departure from circularity in the synthesized
beam was considered acceptable, and a pair of sky re-
gions were selected at −67◦declination after examining
these declination strips in the Sydney University Molon-
glo Sky Survey (SUMSS; Bock, Large & Sadler (1999)) and
in the Parkes-MIT-NRAO survey (PMN; Griﬃth & Wright
(1993)) and ensuring that they were relatively devoid of
strongsources. The skyregions selected for themosaic imag -
ing survey, which we refer to as ATLBS survey region A and
B, have ﬁeld centres at coordinates (J2000.0 epoch) RA:00h35m00s, DEC: −67◦00′00′′and RA: 00h59m17s,
DEC:−67◦00′00′′respectively. The two regions are indi-
vidually mosaics that are covered using 19 pointings, and
they are located beside each other on the sky.
The observations of each of these two sky regions were
made in the four 750-m arrays and each of these four ses-
sions were of 12-hr duration (time shared between the 19
pointing positions). The 20-cm band data were acquired in
two 128-MHz wide bands centred at 1344 and 1432 MHz.
Each band was covered by 16 independent frequency chan-
nels. Multi-channel continuum visibility data were accumu -
lated in full polarization mode: the ATCA antennas have
feeds with linear polarization outputs labeled X and Y and
the polarization products XX, YY, XY and YX are accumu-
lated by the correlator. A journal of the radio observations
is in Table 1.
The ATCA has six antennas: the location of the sixth
antenna—ca06—is ﬁxed and provides baselines between 3
and 5 km with the other ﬁve antennas in the 750 m arrays.
The resulting uv-coverage in our observations is completely
ﬁlled out to 750 m and is sparsely covered in the 3–5 km
range; there is a signiﬁcant ‘hole’ in the coverage between
750 m and 3 km.
4 RADIO IMAGING
The data were processed and imaged using the radio in-
terferometer data reduction package MIRIAD. The calibra-
tor visibilities were ﬁrst viewed using visualization tool s in
MIRIAD and obviously erroneous data were rejected. The
multi-channel continuum visibility data were calibrated i n
amplitude, phase and for the bandpass using periodic ob-
servations of the unresolved calibrator PKS B2353 −686; the
absolute ﬂux density scale was set using observations of the
primary calibrator PKS B1934 −638. Polarization calibra-
tion for the telescope were derived from the full polariza-
tion products measured on PKS B2353 −686. A ﬁrst pass
was made on rejecting data with interference using an auto-
mated algorithm that examined the Stokes V visibilities and
rejected the data corresponding to all polarization produc ts
at the same times and channels where the Stokes V visibility
amplitudes exceeded a threshold of 4 times the rms thermal
noise. The visibility data on the survey ﬁelds in individual
baselines, in XY and YX polarization products, were vi-
sualized as grey-scale displays of channel versus time, and
obviously discordant data values were rejected. The data in
XX and YY polarization products were also rejected during
these times and for the same channels.
The mosaicing strategy adopted here is to individu-
ally image and deconvolve the diﬀerent pointings and then
combine them to produce a single wide-ﬁeld image. This
approach—as compared to a ‘joint’ approach wherein all
pointings are handled simultaneously during the imaging
and deconvolution steps—is appropriate in the present case
where dynamic ranges exceeding several hundred or so are
desired and imaging structures on the scale of the antenna
primary beam and larger is not a requirement.

4.1 A low resolution image with high surface
brightness sensitivity
The individual pointing visibilities were separately pro-
cessed; ca06 was excluded from this initial analysis that wa s
aimed at making Stokes I images with high surface bright-
ness sensitivity using the 0–750 m baselines. As a ﬁrst step
images of 4◦×4◦were constructed, which were seven times
wider than the primary beam FWHM, so that sources in
the ﬁrst sidelobe would be represented. The wide-ﬁeld im-
ages were deconvolved, the ‘clean’ components representin g
sources within the main lobe of the primary beam were iso-
lated and their contribution to the visibility subtracted, and
then images were constructed representing the contributio ns
from sources inthesidelobes. These featuresare signiﬁcan tly
diﬀerent from the point spread function (synthesized beam)
due to azimuthal asymmetries in the sidelobe pattern to-
gether with the alt-azimuth nature of the mounts of the
ATCA antennas. The response to sources in the sidelobeswere deconvolved and represented as ‘clean’ components—
composed of positive and negative components—and this
model representing all of the response to sources outside
the main lobe of the primary beam was then subtracted
from the multi-channel visibilities. In the subsequent re-
duction, only the primary beam main lobe area was con-
sidered. The visibility data were then imaged, deconvolved
andself-calibrated iteratively.Initially thephases alo ne were
self-calibrated, then the amplitudes in the two frequency
bands were allowed to separately scale (in an amplitude
self-calibration step); this eﬀectively amounts to an ampl i-
tude correction based on the weighted mean spectral in-
dex of all of the sources in the ﬁeld. In ﬁnal iterations
the visibilities were self calibrated in amplitude and phas e.
The processed visibilties were used to image the individual
ﬁelds adopting the multi-frequency deconvolution algorit hm
(Sault & Wieringa 1994); this allows for diﬀering spectral
indices among the sources in the ﬁeld and also corrects, to

ﬁrst order, for eﬀects arising from the variation in the pri-
mary beam with frequency.
The images corresponding tothe 19pointings constitut-
ing each ﬁeld were lastly combined as a linear mosaic, fully
correcting for the primary beam attenuation within the mo-
saic region but retaining attenuations at the edges of the
mosaic to prevent excessive noise ampliﬁcation there. Thes e
mosaic images of the ATLBS regions A & B are shown in
Figs. 1 & 2 respectively. The images have an rms noise of
σ= 85µJy beam−1and the lowest contour level displayed is
at 3σ. The peak in the image of region A is 104 mJy beam−1
and that in region B is 246 mJy beam−1. The negative peaks
in the two images are at levels −450 and −575µJy beam−1
respectively, which are at the 5–7 σlevel. The ratio of image
peak to rms noise exceeds 1000 and the images show no ob-
vious artefacts due to calibration or imaging errors above a
level of 3 σ.
Images in Stokes Q and U were constructed using thesame baselines and weighting schemes used in making the
Stokes I images. In making these images, we followed the
procedure of ﬁrst constructing wide-ﬁeld 4◦×4◦images,
isolating the clean components representing emission from
the side lobes of the primary beam, subtracted these com-
ponents from the visibility data, then constructed images
representing emission from the main lobes corresponding to
each pointing position. The images corresponding to the dif -
ferent pointings were then combined as a linear mosaic to
reconstructtheStokesQandUemission from ATLBSregion
A and, separately, region B.
Additionally, we have constructed Stokes V images of
the two ﬁelds. No obvious sources are seen above the image
thermalnoise. Thepeak-to-peakintensityﬂuctuationsint he
Stokes V images are in the range ±0.47 mJy beam−1, at
±5.5σ; these values are similar in magnitude to the negative
peaks in the Stokes I images indicating that the negative
c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–0006Subrahmanyan, Ekers, Saripalli & Sadler
peaks in the Stokes I images are consistent with the image
thermal noise.
4.2 A high resolution image of the compact
components
As we have noted above, the 750 m array conﬁgurations
have, additionally, sparse uv-coverage in the 3–5 km range
as baselines to the sixth antenna ca06. While we have taken
every eﬀort to ensure that the low resolution survey is of
the highest quality, we may examine the additional infor-
mation provided by the baselines to ca06 that could pro-
vide some critical information on the compact components
in the sources even though the uv-coverage is incomplete.
We have used these longer baselines to construct indepen-
dent images of the two survey regions with higher angular
resolution. However, owing to the signiﬁcant ‘hole’ in the
uv-coverage below 3 km in this visibility dataset, the syn-
thesized beam has signiﬁcant sidelobes and confusion is a
serious issue. Therefore, we have aided the deconvolution b y
using the low-resolution images constructed using the 750-
m arrays to identify the sky regions that potentially contai n
source components.
The ﬁrst step involved constructing a model represent-
ing sources detected outside the primary beam main lobe
using all the 750 m array data, including the baselines to
the 6-km antenna, and subtracting this from the visibil-
ity data. The visibilities were then self-calibrated in pha se,
using models for source components that were derived by
imaging the primary beam main lobe region, and the gains
of the data in the two frequency bands were allowed a self-
calibration adjustment. The high resolution images were
constructed using exclusively the baselines to ca06, which
correspond to a uv-coverage that sparsely ﬁlls the annulus
between 3 and 5 km. Deconvolution of these images was
performed iteratively wherein the search region for source
components was progressively widened and the component
search regions in successive deconvolution iteration step s
was derived from deconvolved images of previous steps. In
the ﬁnal deconvolution step the search areas conformed to
the regions in the low resolution images—which were con-
structed using the 750-m baselines—in which the pixel in-
tensity exceeded 0.4 mJy beam−1(about 5 ×rms noise).
The high resolution images have been constructed using
5 instantaneous baselines per conﬁguration compared with
10baselines usedtomakethelowresolutionimages. Therms
noise is, therefore, expected to be about 120 µJy beam−1,
andthisexpectationisveryclose tothatmeasuredinregion s
of the images that are apparantly source free. Deconvolu-
tion iterations were stopped when the peaks in the residual
image, within the regions being searched for components,
reduced below 0.4 mJy beam−1. This implies that in the
high resolution images the fractional ﬂux density exceedin g
0.4 mJy are deconvolvedand restored with Gaussian compo-
nents; however, fractional intensities below 0.4 mJy conti nue
to be represented by beams with signiﬁcant sidelobe struc-
ture and their integral ﬂux density over the image will be
zero.
The size of the restoring beam following deconvolution
was determined by ﬁtting Gaussian models to the main
lobes of the synthesized beams. The high resolution images
of ATLBS survey regions A and B were made with beamFWHM 4 .′′7×4.′′5 at P.A. −7.◦8 and 4.′′8×4.′′4 at P.A. 3 .◦3
respectively. Since the uv-coverage is an annulus, we might
expect that extended source components exceeding the size
of these beams would be resolved and their ﬂux densities
would be severely attenuated in these images. Nevertheless ,
source components with size less than these beams would be
represented.
As an example, a portion of survey region A is shown
in Fig. 3, where the high resolution image is in grey scales
and the corresponding low resolution image is represented
using contours. Most of the sources represented by closed
contours also have compact components in the grey scale
image; sources that appear extended in the low resolution
image often appear to have multiple compact components.
5 PROPERTIES OF THE RADIO SOURCES IN
THE SURVEY
The radio images were scanned, sources identiﬁed, and their
radio properties listed by an automated algorithm. The rou-
tine IMSADinMIRIADwas modiﬁed for this purpose. Only
the sky region where the primary beam response in the mo-
saic exceeds 50% was searched for sources, and ﬂux density
estimates were corrected for the primary beam attenuation.
Islands in the low resolution images, with connected
pixels exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1, were considered to be in-
dependent sources. Thus, the ATLBS source catalogue pre-
sented herein includes all sources that have a peak ﬂux den-
sity exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1in the low resolution im-
ages. The centroid position of these connected pixels was
listedasthesourcepositionandthesourcenamewas derived
from this centroid position. Sources were automatically cl as-
siﬁed as unresolved, extended Gaussian or composite based
on their structure in the low resolution image and the suc-
cess in modeling the images using single-component Gaus-
sians. Peak and total ﬂux densities were estimated for each
source, both in the low resolution image and separately in
the high resolution image. Extended sources without com-
posite structure were ﬁtted using single Gaussian models
and the ﬁt parameters as well as deconvolved source sizes
were derived.
The fractional integrated polarized intensity Π 0was es-
timated for the ATLBS sources from the low resolution im-
ages in Stokes Q, U and I. Image pixels in which the Stokes
I intensity exceeded 0.4 mJy beam−1were considered, pixel
intensities in Stokes Q, U and I were summed separately, a

to a multiplication of the power spectrum in the transform
domain by a J1(u)/uform window. Consequently, the noise

ﬂux density.
In the case of the imaging using the 750-m array data,
the synthesized beam has small amplitude sidelobes because
theuv-coverage is almost complete. However, in the case of
the high resolution imaging the synthesized beam is very
diﬀerent from a Gaussian approximation to the main lobe;
therefore, estimating integral ﬂux densities of sources in the
high resolution image suﬀers uncertainties andrequires ca re-
ful understanding of the inherent limitations arising from
the annular visibility coverage and the cutoﬀ level adopted
during deconvolution.
Within the search region, the farthest distance of a
source from pointing centres is 16 .′4. Therefore, owing to
the ﬁnite bandwidth of the frequency channels in the
multi-frequencycontinuumdata, visibility amplitudes at the
longest baseline of 5020 m would be expected to have a
worst case attenuation to 0.45 of the true value. Simula-
tions using the visibility coverage used to construct the hi gh
resolution images and taking into consideration the chan-
nel bandwidth corresponding to the observations suggest a
worst case attenuation of source peaks to 0.8 of their true
value in the high resolution images. We have modeled the
bandwidth-related attenuation using a functional form ﬁt-
ted to the simulation results and used this to scale the peaks
derived from the high resolution images.
In the high-resolution image, the search for the peak
ﬂux density is over a ‘footprint’ on the sky corresponding
to the area enclosed by the contour at 0.4 mJy beam−1in
the low-resolution image, or the contour at half the peak
ﬂux density if this is lower. The median size of the foot-
print, for sources with total ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy
is 107 beam areas (of the high-resolution image). Our al-
gorithm estimates peak ﬂux densities in the high resolution
images by searching for the peak within the corresponding
footprint. The probability of a spurious peak of ﬂux density
0.4 mJy occuring in the high resolution images and within
the footprint area is below 5%; therefore we may considerthose tabulated peaks exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1as reliable
at the 95% conﬁdence level.
The integrated ﬂux density of the sources in the high
resolution image were estimated by summing the ﬂux densi-
ties in the compact components. An iterative algorithm was
adopted wherein the peak within the ‘footprint’ was located ,
a Gaussian ﬁt made to the component corresponding to the
peak and the Gaussian component subtracted from the high
resolution image. Successive peaks—including positive an d
negative peaks—were located, ﬁtted with Gaussian compo-
nents and subtracted until the absolute value of the peak
residual was below a threshold of 0.5 mJy beam−1. Thus,
the listed values of integrated ﬂux densities in the high res -
olution images is an estimate of the total ﬂux density in
compact components exceeding 0.5 mJy; in case the peak
within the source ’footprint’ is less than 0.5 mJy then the
listed integrated ﬂux density is simply the peak ﬂux density .
A total of 511 sources were identiﬁed in Field A and 585
sources in Field B. The two ﬁelds have a slight overlap in
which there are two common sources; therefore, the number
of sources in our catalogue exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1peak
ﬂux density is 1094 over the 8.42 deg2sky area.
Of the 484 sources with total ﬂux density in the range
0.4–1.0 mJy, 409 were classiﬁed as unresolved in the low
resolution images made with beam FWHM of 50′′. Of the
75 extended sources (15% of the sources in the 0.4–1.0 mJy
range), 64 were deemed to be representable using a single
Gaussian model; only 11 sources were classiﬁed as compos-
ite.Thefraction ofsourcesclassiﬁedtobeextendedincrea ses
to 28% in sources with ﬂux density in the range 1–10 mJy
and about half of these sources are deemed composite in
structure. As much as 70% of sources in the 10-100 mJy
range in ﬂux density are extended, with three-fourths of
these classiﬁed as composite. The fraction of sources that
are deemed extended and with structure well ﬁt by single
Gaussian models is about 15% over the entire ﬂux density
range 0.4–100 mJy; however, the fraction that is deemed as
possessing composite structure increases with ﬂux density
rising from about 2% for the sub-mJy population to above
50% for sources with 100 mJy ﬂux density.
The angular size for the ATLBS sources were esti-
mated by measuring the area enclosed by the contour at
0.4 mJy beam−1, assuming that the source has a Gaussian
proﬁle, and computing the source width at half maximum.
This estimate is expected to be conservative, and yields me-
dian angular size of 10′′for sources with ﬂux density be-
low 10 mJy, rising to 20′′for sources in the 10-100 mJy
bin. As compared to the linear size distribution derived
by Windhorst et al. (1990), the median angular size of the
ATLBS sources appears substantially larger and the distri-
bution in angular size appears to cutoﬀ more sharply. Most
ATLBS sources appear only marginally resolved in the low-
surface-brightness images made with beam FWHM of about
50′′, and we postpone a discussion of the angular size distri-
bution of the ATLBS sources to later papers where detailed
structural information is presented.

The absolute ﬂux density scale is based on the adopted
ﬂux density of the primary calibrator PKS B1934 −638,
which is within 2% of the Baars et al. (1977) scale. The ab-
solute position of the phase calibrator has been measured
with respect to the International Celestial Reference Fram e
(ICRF) using long baseline interferometers (Ma et al. 1998) .
The calibrated visibilities are expected to have 8% ampli-
tude errors because of discrete source confusion within the
primary beam during the calibrator observations. As a con-
sequence, the initial model images, which serve as an in-
put to the self-calibration and also determine the absolute
astrometry might have a systematic position error of 0 .′′1.
Image noise contributes an rms error of (2/S mJy) arcsec in
positions of sources, which adds in quadrature to the sys-
tematic error term (S mJyis the source ﬂux density in mJy).
At the ﬂux limit of 0.4 mJy, the position error may be as
large as 5′′or a tenth of the synthesized beam FWHM. The
image dynamic range is 1000, which implies that subsequent

The errors in peak and total ﬂux density estimates are dom-
inated by the image noise for sources below about 4 mJy,
and may be as much as 20% for the faintest sub-mJy sources
detected in the survey. The listed total and peak ﬂux densi-
ties were estimated from the ATLBS low-resolution survey
images and the corresponding high resolution images; these
images have rms noise of 0.085 and 0.12 mJy beam−1re-

5.1 Completeness and reliability of the survey
Reliability of source detection is a major issue in most sur-
veys, particularly interferometer surveys that have poor v is-
ibility coverage. The ATLBS survey is unique in that the
entire survey regions are observed with complete visibil-
ity coverage! Therefore, the synthesized beams are well be-
haved and the reliability of the survey is determined by
the image thermal noise. The noise in the ATLBS images
are well deﬁned from the data using Stokes V images: the
rms noise is 85 µJy beam−1. We have limited the cata-
logue to sources detected with a peak ﬂux density exceed-
ing 0.4 mJy beam−1, which is 4.7 times the rms noise.
At this level, the Stokes V images have 4 peaks exceeding
0.4 mJy beam−1over the entire survey area and these are in
the range 0.4–0.5 mJy beam−1, indicating that about 0.4%
of the sources in the catalogue might be spurious noise peaks
and that these spurious sources would be close to the ﬂux
limit of the catalogue.
In any survey image, the observed ﬂux density of a
source would be the true ﬂux density plus thermal noise.
Depending on the value of the noise at the position of the
source, the estimated ﬂux density would be altered. When
sources are binned in ﬂux density, noise results in movement
of sources up or down bins. In eﬀect, the source counts are
smoothed by a function whose width depends on the ther-
mal noise in the image. In the mJy and sub-mJy regime
that is being explored in the ATLBS survey, the diﬀerential
source counts steeply decrease with increasing ﬂux density
and, therefore, we expect that a net excess of faint sources
would be detected because some sources below the ﬂux den-
sity cutoﬀ would be noise biased to lie above the detection
threshold.
To estimate the completeness and reliability of the
ATLBS survey and assess the eﬀect of noise bias on the
detection of sources, we have made simulations in which
sources were assumed to have a distribution in ﬂux den-
sity corresponding to the counts derived by Hopkins et al.
(2003). Owing to the image rms noise of 85 µJy beam−1,
the expectation from the simulations is that the number of
sources detected in the 0.4–0.8 mJy bin would be enhanced
by 16%, that in the 0.8–1.6 mJy bin would be enhanced by
2.5% and that in octave bins at higher ﬂux density would
be altered by less than a percent. As expected, the eﬀect is
greatest close to the ﬂux density cutoﬀ. 18% of the sources
in the 0.4-0.8 mJy bin are translated to adjacent bins—13%
tobelow 0.4 mJy and 5% to above 0.8 mJy—butthis is over-
compensated by sources that are noise biased and translated
up in ﬂux density from below the cutoﬀ.
To summarize, spurious sources are extremely rare and
constitute only about 0.4% of the sources detected above
the cutoﬀ; 13% of sources with true ﬂux density in an octave
bin above the cutoﬀ would be noise biased to values below
the cutoﬀ and, therefore, would fail to enter the catalogue;
however, as much as 27% of the sources detected in the
lowest octave bin of 0.4-0.8 mJy are expected to be genuine
sources with true ﬂux density below the cutoﬀ that are noise
biased to lie above the detection threshold and, therefore,
enter the catalogue.5.2 Confusion and source blending in the survey
A limitation to the reliable detection of discrete radio
sources in radio surveys is confusion, which is because the
radio image is a convolution of the true sky with the tele-
scope beam. In surveys that are made using interferometer
arrays and with sparse visibility coverage, the synthesize d
beams have signiﬁcant sidelobes. Along with the limitation s
to the dynamic range arising from calibration errors, this
makes it diﬃcult to distinguish all of the radio sources in
the survey area although they may be above the detection
threshold as deﬁned by the image thermal noise. The confu-
sion limit on source detection is related to the ﬁlling facto r
in the visibility plane.
The identiﬁcation of discrete sources in the ATLBS sur-
vey was made using the low resolution images, which were
made with complete visibility coverage and, therefore, wit h
well deﬁned synthesized beams. The source catalogue that is
thebasis of the studyofthe radio source population was also
derived from this low resolution image. Therefore, classic al
confusion and its eﬀects on source selection and complete-
ness and reliability are simply related to the ﬁnite resolut ion
of these ATLBS survey images. A measure of the degree
to which confusion and source blending result in errors in
source counts is how sparsely sources are observed to cover
the sky, which depends on the number of beam areas that
are observed to be occupied by sources. In the ATLBS low
resolution images, the number of eﬀective beam areas per
source detected is about 50.
Because of the low angular resolution in the ATLBS
survey, confusion manifests in blending of discrete radio
sources. We have estimated the ‘blending correction’ from
simulations. Sources were assumed to span a range 0.1–
409.6 mJy in ﬂux density and Poisson random distributed
over the sky area. A distribution in ﬂux density correspond-
ing to the source counts derived by Hopkins et al. (2003)
was adopted, which was based on the Phoenix deep survey
(PDS). Sources were deemed to be confused if they were
connected by a contour at a level of 0.4 mJy beam−1, which
was the criterion adopted while forming the ATLBS source
catalogue. Confusion between sources in diﬀerent ﬂux den-
sity bins, as well as blending of multiple sources, was al-
lowed for in the simulations. The high surface density of
sources with low ﬂux density and the large sky areas cov-
ered by the point spread functions associated with sources
with relatively higher ﬂux density together result in a con-
fusion between weak sources with the stronger sources. The
simulations revealed that for the adopted PDSsource counts
and the image point spread function corresponding to the
ATLBS, confusion results in a signiﬁcant reduction in the
number of sources in octave-band ﬂux-density bins below
about 1 mJy, and a small fractional increment in source
counts at higher ﬂux densities. Based on the simulations,
we estimate that the blending correction factor, owing to
classical confusion, is as much as 1.2 in a 0.4–0.8 mJy bin,
about 1.02 in a 0.8–1.6 mJy bin, and less than 2% in higher
ﬂux density bins.
The high resolution images were constructed from
sparse visibility coverage and, consequently, confusion i s
indeed an issue that limits the elucidation of the high-
resolution structures. Only 1% of the visibility plane is
covered by the data used to reconstruct these images. As
c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–00012Subrahmanyan, Ekers, Saripalli & Sadler
discussed above, the high-resolution images were examined
only in the regions where sources were identiﬁed in the low
resolution images. Operationally, we have used the low res-
olution images to deﬁne the source regions as a constraint
during the deconvolution of the high resolution images. Thi s
restricted the sources in the high resolution image to be
within 2% of the total survey area and resolves the ambigui-
ties arising from the poor visibility coverage and conseque nt
confusion in the high resolution imaging. We estimate that
even if every one of the discrete sources identiﬁed in the
ATLBS survey were a triple, the number of beam areas per
source component would be 20 in the case of the high res-
olution image. Moreover, in this manuscript we restrict to
using only estimates of the peak and integrated ﬂux densi-
ties of the high resolution images to derive indicators for t he
source complexity and diﬀuseness. Detailed high-resoluti on
radio structures of the ATLBS sources, based on followup
observations that provide improved visibility coverage, w ill
be presented in later ATLBS related publications.
5.3 The source counts
The number density of ATLBS sources detected with peak
ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1is 130 sources per
square degree.
The normalized diﬀerential source counts derived from
the source list are shown in Fig. 5. The total ﬂux densities
were binned in octave bin ranges: 0.4–0.8, 0.8–1.6, 1.6–3.2
and so on till 204.8–409.6 mJy. We plot the normalized dif-
ferential source counts versus the mean ﬂux density ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketrightof
sources in the individual bins, the diﬀerential counts dN/dS
were normalized to ∝angbracketleftS∝angbracketright−2.5.
The total ﬂux densities of the sources were estimated
from the low resolution image: the Gaussian ﬁt parame-
ters were used to infer the total ﬂux densities in the case
of unresolved sources as well as those sources with simple
structure that were well ﬁt using a single Gaussian model.
Composite sources were identiﬁed by the signiﬁcant devia-
tion in the image pixels from the best ﬁt Gaussian model—
most of these sources appeared to be composed of multiple
components—and in these cases the total ﬂux density was
derived by summing the image pixels over the source area.
During the synthesis imaging that made the low-resolution
image, the iterative deconvolution had been terminated at
the 1-σnoise level and as a result the point spread function
for the residual noise slightly diﬀers from the restoring be am
used to convolve the CLEAN components: thus the eﬀective
beam for weak sources slightly diﬀers from the restoring
beam. The algorithm that does the Gaussian ﬁt was lim-
ited to using only image pixels exceeding 2- σand the ﬁt
was weighted by the image pixel intensity to ameliorate the
error in the estimation of source ﬂux densities arising from
this limitation in image ﬁdelity. Nevertheless, there were a
signiﬁcant number of sources with peak ﬂux density exceed-
ing 0.4 mJy beam−1—30 in all—in which the Gaussian ﬁt
parameters were somewhat smaller than the beam size and
the estimate of total ﬂux density for these relatively weak
sources falls below 0.4 mJy. The source counts in the lowest
bin of 0.4–0.8 mJy might be underestimated by 10% due to
this eﬀect, and the error bar for this bin has been enhanced
to reﬂect this additional source of uncertainty.
The source counts in the ﬂux density bins have beenFigure 5. Normalized diﬀerential source counts. The counts de-

corrected for the primary beam attenuation over the survey
area by scaling the count corresponding to each detected
source by the ratio of the total area of the survey and the
area over which the source is detectable: since we truncate
at the level where the primary beam drops to 50%, this
correction is relevant only for the lowest octave bin and in
this binthecounts were scaled upbyafactor 1.33 toaccount
for this eﬀect.
There may be sources with peak ﬂux density below
0.4 mJy beam−1, and missing in the derived source cata-
c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000Australia Telescope Low-brightness Survey 13
logue, which are extended and have total ﬂux density ex-
ceeding 0.4 mJy: the derived ATLBS source counts would
be an underestimate due to such sources as well. However,
analysis of the source structural properties in Sections 5. 5
and 5.6 suggests that most sources have simple structures
at low ﬂux density levels, at least at the resolution of the
ATLBS survey; therefore, we expect any correction owing
to extended source structure to be small. If we adopt the
model for the angular size distribution of sources derived b y

angular size Ψ medof sources with 1.4 GHz ﬂux density S1.4
(in mJy) equal to 2 .0S0.30
1.4arcsec, and an exponential form
for the integral angular size distribution, the resolution cor-
rections required to be made to our derived source counts
are less than 1%.
The ATLBS source counts shown in Fig. 5 have been
corrected for the primary beam attenuation, noise bias that
was discussed in Section 5.1, resolution and blending; thes e
corrected counts are also listed in Table 3. The second col-
umn of the Table lists the mean ﬂux density of sources in
the bins, column 3 lists the number of sources detected in
the individual bins (uncorrected) and the last column lists

for the eﬀects discussed above.
As a comparison, ATESP survey counts
(Prandoni et al. 2001) and the ﬁt to PDS counts
(Hopkins et al. 2003) are also shown in Fig. 5. The
PDS counts were derived from their survey that covered
4.56 deg2area and the ATESP survey covered 26 deg2area;
these are comparable to our survey area of 8.4 deg2.
Within the errors, the observed counts appear consis-
tent with the estimates derived by Prandoni et al. (2001)
based on the ATESP survey. The counts are, however, sys-
tematically lower than that estimated by Hopkins et al.
(2003) based on the PDS: in the ﬂux density range 0.8–
200 mJy our ATLBS counts are on the average a factor 0.8
of the PDS counts. As was the case for the ATESP sur-
vey counts, which do not show an upturn and suggest that
any upturn at faint ﬂux density levels is below 1 mJy, the
ATLBS counts are also consistent with no upturn down to
about 0.6 mJy.
At the faint end of the ﬂux density scale explored by
the ATLBS survey, blending reduces the observed counts
where as noise bias enhances counts. The blending cor-
rections, as well as our estimates for the enhancement in
the observed counts owing to noise bias, might be overesti-
mates because we have assumed the relatively higher counts,
based on the PDS survey, for the simulations that estimate
these correction factors. Additionally, as discussed abov e,
the counts in the lowest bin might be an underestimate due
to missing sources because their peaks may be below the
0.4 mJy beam−1cutoﬀ or because of image errors arising
from the deconvolution algorithm adopted.
A cause for signiﬁcant discrepancies between diﬀerent
estimates ofthesourcecountsatthesub-mJylevelsmightbe
ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld variations. The relatively large sky area, sp read
over multiple sky patches, covered by the ATESP survey
makes these counts a more reliable indicator of counts at
these faint levels and there is good agreement between the
ATLBS counts and the ATESP counts in the 0.4–1.6 mJy
bins: both are systematically low compared to the PDS sur-
vey counts.Thesystematic lowcountsderivedfrom theATLBSsur-
vey is not owing to classical confusion; the ATLBS counts
presented here have been corrected for blending confusion.
The low counts, relative to the PDS, could be interpreted
as arising due to a 30% underestimate in the ﬂux density
of sources, or a 20% reduction in numbers of sources. Since
the ATLBS has good surface brightness sensitivity, it is ex-
pected that the source catalogues derived from the survey
would not have any missing ﬂux density. Additionally, the
ATLBS survey is potentially capable of detecting extended
sources with low surface brightness, which may be missed in
other surveys.The low countsare more likely indicatingtha t
the ATLBS survey detects a smaller number of sources as
compared to surveys like the PDS. It has been pointed out
by Hopkins et al. (2003) that the PDS counts are based on a
component catalogue, rather than a source catalogue as was
the case for the ATESP counts. Source counts derived from
such component catalogues would be expected to overesti-
mate the numbers of sources as a result of sources in higher
ﬂux density bins degenerating into multiple sources in bins
with lower ﬂux densities. The ATLBS survey is a source cat-
alogue owing to the relatively large size of the synthesized
beam; therefore, it is unsurprising that the counts derived
are consistent with that of the ATESP survey and below the
PDS counts.
5.4 The fractional polarization in ATLBS sources
As discussed above in Section 5, we have derived estimates
for the percentage integrated polarization Π 0for the ATLBS
sources using the low resolution images, integrating Stoke s
Q,UandIoverthesource,computingthedebiasedpolarised
intensity and dividing by the total intensity. The sources
were binned in ﬂux density, and the median integrated per-
centage polarization ∝angbracketleftΠ0∝angbracketrightas well as the mean ﬂux density
∝angbracketleftSmJy∝angbracketrightof the sources in the individual bins were computed;
these values are in Table 4. The errors have been estimated
usingtheEfronbootstrap method(Efron 1979),inwhichthe
samples in each bin were randomly resampled with replace-
ment to derive a sampling distribution of the median and,
thereby, an estimate of the error in the median. In Fig. 6 we
plot the median integrated percentage polarization Π 0ver-
sus mean ﬂux density for the binned data. The plot clearly
shows an increasing fractional polarization with decreasi ng
ﬂux density. This trend is consistent with the observation
that among polarized radio sources, the faint sources are
more highly polarized than the relatively stronger sources
(Taylor et al. 2007).
The binned data were ﬁtted to a power-law to derive
the trend:
∝angbracketleftΠ0∝angbracketright= 10.56∝angbracketleftSmJy∝angbracketright−0.565, (2)
where∝angbracketleftΠ0∝angbracketrightis the median percentage integrated polariza-
tion and ∝angbracketleftSmJy∝angbracketrightis the mean ﬂux density (in mJy). The ﬁt
is also shown in Fig 6. The data appears well ﬁt by this sin-
gle power-law form over more than a decade in ﬂux density;
however, there appears to be a ﬂattening above 10 mJy sug-
gesting that at higher ﬂux densities the fractional integra ted
polarization in sources may not change with ﬂux density.
We have adopted a signal-to-noise ratio based cutoﬀ
that sets to zero estimates of polarized intensity that are
below one standard deviation of the expected noise. Such a

cutoﬀ may potentially result in a positive residual polariz a-
tion bias if the polarized intensity has a low signal-to-noi se
ratio (Leahy & Fernini 1989). The estimator of fractional
integrated polarization, Π 0, was separately recomputed as-
suming a signal-to-noise ratio based cutoﬀ that set to zero
estimations that are below two standard deviations of the
expected noise: in this case as well the mean percentage po-
larizations continued to display the trend of increasing fr ac-
tional polarization withdecreasingﬂuxdensity,although the
residual polarization bias in this case is expected to be neg -
ative at low signal-to-noise ratios. This test adds weight t o
our ﬁnding that the fractional polarization in radio source s
increases with decreasing ﬂux density.
5.5 Complexity of radio sources at sub-mJy ﬂux
density
The radio sources were identiﬁed in the low resolution im-
ages as a set of connected pixels with intensity exceeding
0.4 mJy beam−1. These images have a high surface bright-Figure 7. Median complexity χof sources in the ATLBS survey.
The sources have been binned in ranges in ﬂux density; the tot al
ﬂux density estimated from the low resolution ATLBS survey
images were used in the binning. Error bars are ±1 standard
deviation.

nesssensitivityandwere madewithabeam ofFWHMabout
50′′. The total ﬂux densities were estimated either from a
Gaussian ﬁt to the source image pixels in this low resolution
image or, in the case of sources with composite structure,
from a summation over the image pixel intensities. Apart
from deriving a value for the peak ﬂux density in the low
resolution image, we have also separately derived the peak
ﬂux densities in each of the sources from the high resolution
images, which were made with beam FWHM about 4 .′′6.
Theratioofthetotalﬂuxdensity,as measuredusingthe
low resolution image, to the peak ﬂux density, as measured
in the high resolution image, is a measure of the departure
of the source appearance from that of an unresolved object
of size well below 4 .′′6. This ratio χ, which we adopt as a
measure of how complex sources appear to be, is a measure
of how complex the source structure is when observed with
a beam of FWHM 4 .′′6.χis expected to be unity for unre-
solved sources, and exceed unity for resolved sources. χwill
exceed unity not only in the case of sources with extended
emission that is resolved by a 4 .′′6 beam, but also in the
case where the source is composed of multiple components
(which may be individually unresolved). Additionally, χwill
exceed unity in cases where the source in the low resolution
c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000Australia Telescope Low-brightness Survey 15
image is confused, for example, because two or more unre-
solved and unrelated sources lie close together on the sky
and within the 50′′beam of the low resolution image. As
discussed in Section 5.2, such blending is not expected to be
an issue at ﬂux density exceeding 0.8 mJy, and the eﬀect of
blending on source counts at these higher ﬂux density levels
is expected to be less than 2%.
There are 1063 sources in the ATLBS survey with to-
tal ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy. The median χfor these
sources is 1.28. 20% of the sources have χexceeding 2.0,
which implies that when observed with beam FWHM 4 .′′6,
close to a ﬁfth of the ATLBS sources are either doubles,
triples or more complex sources or have more than half of
their total ﬂux density in extended emission components.
In Table 5 we list the median complexity of sources in
bins of total ﬂux density. In Fig. 7 is shown the distribution
of median complexity χversus total ﬂux density. The errors
listed in the table, as well as the error bars in the ﬁgure, cor -
respond to 1 standard deviation errors that were estimated
from the data using the Efron bootstrap method (Efron
1979). The bins were chosen to have widths increasing with
ﬂuxdensity;binwidths are proportional to(ﬂuxdensity)3/2.
Fig. 7 shows that the source complexity increases with in-
creasing total ﬂux density. This is consistent with earlier
ﬁndings that the median angular size of sources declines to-
wards lower ﬂux density, and that fainter radio sources are
increasingly compact.
The derivedsource complexity χhas errors owing to the
error in the estimates for source total ﬂux density and the
peak ﬂux density in the high-resolution image. Values of to-
tal ﬂux density have rms errors less than 20%; errors are less
than 10% in sources with ﬂux density exceeding 1 mJy. The
peak ﬂux density in the high resolution image has an abso-
lute rms error of 0.12 mJy. As discussed above in Section 5,
the median source ‘footprint’, which is the search area for
the peak in the high resolution image, has 107 (high resolu-
tion image) beam areas. It follows that the probability of a
chance peak within the ‘footprint’ exceeding 0.45 mJy is les s
than about 1%. Spurious noise peaks within the footprint,
which exceed the true peak ﬂux density of the source, would
result in an over estimate of the peak ﬂux density and lead
to an underestimate for the source complexity. The estimate
for source complexity χwould, therefore, be a lower limit to
its true value and this underestimation would be greater in
sources with smaller ﬂux density.
If we consider sources in the 0.5–0.9 mJy bin, which has
the sources with lowest ﬂux density, the median ﬂux density
is 0.67 mJy and the sources are estimated to have a median
complexity of 1 .19±0.03. For sources in this bin, the proba-
bility that a noise peak within the source footprint exceeds
0.45 mJy and, consequently, the complexity is underesti-
mated to have a value below 1.19 is less than 1%. Therefore,
it is unlikely that image noise causes the median complex-
ity of sources in the 0.5-0.9 mJy bin to be as low as 1.19.
The eﬀects of image noise are less signiﬁcant in the source
complexity estimates at higher ﬂux densities. The low value
for the source complexity estimated for the sub-mJy ATLBS
population, and the rise in complexity with ﬂux density, are
likely to be genuine.
If we consider sub-mJy sources in the ﬂux density range
0.7–1.0 mJy, for which the ﬂux densities all exceed six times
thermsnoise inthehighresolution image, asigniﬁcant num-Figure 8. Median value of the degree of diﬀuse emission χof

ber of these sources may have complexity exceeding 2.0 de-
spite the noise. Even if all of these sources have true χex-
ceeding 2.0, only in about a sixth of these sources do we
expect the noise peaks in the high resolution image to re-
sult in estimates for the complexities below 2.0. We ﬁndthat
only 8% of sources in this ﬂuxdensity range havecomplexity
exceeding 2.0. In contrast, 28% sources in the ﬂux density
range 1–10 mJy have complexity exceeding 2.0, and 55%
sources in the 10-100 mJy range have complexity exceeding
2.0.
5.6 Diﬀuse emission associated with sub-mJy
radio sources
The parameter χintroduced above is a measure of the de-
gree of source complexity, but does not distinguish sources
with extended or diﬀuse emission from sources with multi-
ple components, composite structure composed of compact
components, and confusion.
The high resolution images described in Section 4 were
constructed using a visibility coverage that is an annulus
and the beam FWHM is about 4 .′′6; therefore, it is expected
c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–00016Subrahmanyan, Ekers, Saripalli & Sadler
that extended emission on scales exceeding 4 .′′6 would be re-
solved out and absent in these images. The fractional ﬂux
density in extended emission, which would be missing in the
4.′′6 resolution images, may be characterized by the ratio of
the total ﬂux density in the low resolution images to the
integrated ﬂux density in the high resolution images. We re-
fer to this ratio parameter as δ, representing the degree of
diﬀuse emission in the source or, in other words, a diﬀuse-
ness parameter. This parameter is expected to reveal the
quantum of ﬂux density in extended diﬀuse emission.
The median value of δfor the sources with total ﬂux
density exceeding 0.4 mJy in the ATLBS survey is 1 .09±
0.02; about half of the sources have more than a tenth of
their ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission. The median δis signif-
icantly smaller thanthe median χ, which is 1.28, as might be
expected since the complex structure is only partly diﬀuse
structure. About 10% of the ATLBS sources with ﬂux den-
sity exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1haveδexceeding 2.0; these
sources have over half of their total ﬂux density in diﬀuse
emission.
We have computed the median value of the degree of
diﬀuse structure—median δ—in bins of total ﬂux density,
where the source total ﬂux density is determined from the
low resolution images with high surface brightness sensiti v-
ity. In Fig. 8 is shown the variation in δwith total ﬂux den-
sity; the values are in Table 6. The errors were estimated
from the data, as above, using the Efron bootstrap method.
The ATLBS radio source population does not show any sig-
niﬁcant trend in the degree of diﬀuse emission δversus total
ﬂux density, although the source complexity χshows a sig-
niﬁcant rise towards higher total ﬂux density. The increase d
complexity in sources with higher ﬂux density appears to be
owing to the sources being composed of multiple compact
components rather than increased fraction of diﬀuse emis-
sion. The fractional ﬂux in diﬀuse emission appears to be
fairly constant, independent of total ﬂux density, at least in
the range 0.4–100 mJy.
The total ﬂux density is determined from the low reso-
lution images with rms noise 0.085 mJy beam−1. The frac-
tional error in this estimate is at most 20%, and less than
10% for sources with total ﬂux density exceeding 1 mJy.
The integrated ﬂux density estimate derived from the high-
resolution image is a summation of the ﬂux densities in com-
pact components with peak exceeding 0.5 mJy; in those
cases where no compact component exceeds this thresh-
old the estimate for integrated ﬂux density is simply the
value of the peak within the ‘footprint’. Therefore, the tab -
ulated values of integrated ﬂux density of compact com-
ponents, which are used in estimating δ, represent a lower
limit to the integrated ﬂux in compact components and may
miss compact components that have peak ﬂux density be-
low 0.5 mJy beam−1in the high resolution image. On the
other hand, the high resolution images have an rms noise of
0.12 mJy beam−1and in cases where the source does not
have compact components above this noise the noise peak
within the ‘footprint’ would be tabulated as the integrated
ﬂux density of compact components. There is less than 1%
chance of a noise peak exceeding 0.45 mJy within the foot-
print; however, peaks exceeding 0.35 mJy are expected with
25% probability. Weak compact components that are missed
result in an overestimate in δ, noise in the high resolution
image results in underestimates for δ. Owing to the imagerms noise, sources with a given total ﬂux density are un-
likely to have δexceeding an upper bound; for example, it is
unlikely that sources with total ﬂux density below 0.56 mJy
haveδ >2.0.
We deﬁne the sky area of any source to be the area en-
closed by the 0.4 mJy beam−1contour in the low resolution
image of the source. We have estimated the integrated ﬂux
density in the compact components in any source by sum-
ming the ﬂux densities of all the components in the high
resolution image that are located within the sky area of the
source. This integrated ﬂux density exceeds the peak ﬂux
density of the source (as measured in the high resolution
image) in most cases, as expected. The excess may be quan-
tiﬁed as the ratio of the integrated to the peak ﬂux density;
both measured in the high resolution images. We ﬁnd that
this excess increases with increasing ﬂux density. 36% of
sources with ﬂux density exceeding 10 mJy have this ratio
ofthe integrated topeak ﬂuxdensityexceeding2and 10% of
sources in the 1–10 mJy range have integrated ﬂux density
exceeding the peak by a factor 2 or more. In the sub-mJy
population of sources that have an integrated ﬂux density
in the 0.4–1.0 mJy range (484 sources), where estimates of
this ratio may be considered to be lower limits, less than
1% of sources have listed integrated ﬂux density exceeding
the peak by a factor of 2. This ﬁnding is consistent with a
change in the radio structure of ATLBS sources with ﬂux
density in which the abundance of multiple compact com-
ponents is greater in sources with higher ﬂux density: the
fainter sources may be dominated by sources with a single
compact component whereas brighter sources have double
and triple compact structures.
6 SUMMARY
We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to
survey 8.42 deg2sky area at a radio frequency of 1388 MHz.
The interferometer observations were made in a mode de-
signed to mosaic image the wide ﬁeld with complete visi-
bility coverage, and hence low confusion, and with excep-
tional surface brightness sensitivity. The data were used t o
reconstruct (a) a low resolution image, with beam FWHM
53′′×47′′and rms noise 0.08 mJy beam−1, and (b) a high
resolution image with beam FWHM of 4 .′′6. Whereas the low
resolution image reproduces the extended and diﬀuse radio
emission associated with sources in the ﬁelds, the high res-
oluion image resolves out structure on scales exceeding the
beam size. Together, the images provide an estimate of the
structural properties of the mJy and sub-mJy radio sources.
We refer to our radio survey as the Australia Telescope low
brightness survey, and use the acronym ATLBS.
A total of 1094 radio sources with peak ﬂux density
exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1in the low resolution image were
cataloged and their source properties estimated. The sourc e
detections correspond to a density of 130 sources per square
degree. The studies presented herein have considered only
sources with peak ﬂux density exceeding about 5 times the
rms noise in the image.
The normalized diﬀerential source counts derived from
the ATLBS shows no evidence for an upturn down to about
0.6 mJy; the ATLBS counts are consistent with the ATESP
source counts, but relatively low compared to many other
c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000Australia Telescope Low-brightness Survey 17
surveys, including the PDS. This result suggests that there
is nosubstantial populationof lowsurface brightnesssour ces
or source components at these ﬂux densities that have been
missed by previous surveys. The ATLBS counts—as also
ATESP counts—are relatively low compared to many other
counts perhaps because our counts are based on a source
catalog, rather than a component catalog. As far as we
know, blending has been considered and corrected for the
ﬁrst time in the work presented herein; blending is of con-
cern in surveys such as the ATLBS that aim to go deep
in surface brightness sensitivity. The derived ATLBS sourc e
counts have been corrected for blending, noise bias, resolu -
tion and primary beam attenuation over the survey area.
The derived source counts are consistent with that of
the ATESP survey suggesting that the relatively large sky
coverage of these surveys is key to robust measurement of
source counts. The considerable scatter in the derived dif-
ferential source counts at about 1 mJy ﬂux density between
the various surveys that were made with relatively smaller
sky coverage is perhaps owing to genuine ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld vari-
ations in counts. To summarize, the work presented here
emphasises the importance of constucting source catalogs,
accounting for blending and noise bias, and making large
area surveys in order to reﬁne our understanding of diﬀer-
ential source counts at sub-mJy and mJy ﬂux densities.
The main results presented in this paper concern the
statistical properties of the radio structure and polariza tion
in sub-mJy sources compared to the mJy radio source pop-
ulation. We have deﬁned a complexity parameter χas the
ratio of the total ﬂux density of the source to the peak ﬂux
density in the high resolution image, this parameter is a
measure of the source complexity and the departure of the
source structure from an unresolved single compact compo-
nent.Additionally,we havedeﬁnedadiﬀusenessparameter δ
astheratiooftotalﬂuxdensitytothesumoftheﬂuxdensity
in compact components, this parameter is a measure of the
ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission components. These measures
of morphology have been computed for all ATLBS sources.
The points arising from an examination of the sources above
and below 1 mJy ﬂux density are listed below.
(i) In the low-resolution images made with 50′′beam, the
fraction of extended sources rises from 15% for the sub-mJy
population to 28% for 1–10 mJy sources and to 70% for 10–
100 mJy sources. At this resolution, only 2% of sub-mJy
sources are observed to have composite structure where as
this fraction rises to 15% for 1–10 mJy sources and 50% for
10–100 mJy sources.
(ii) Less than 1% of the sub-mJy ATLBS sources have
been observed to have multiple compact components. How-
ever, about 10% of 1–10 mJy sources have multiple compact
components and this fraction rises to 36% in sources in the
10–100 mJy range.
(iii) The median complexity χfor ATLBS sources is 1.28
and the median diﬀuseness δis 1.09. 20% of ATLBS sources
haveχexceeding 2.0, implying that a ﬁfth of the sources are
doubles or triples or have more than half their ﬂux density
in extended emission. 10% of the ATLBS sources have δ
exceeding 2.0, implying that a tenth of the sources have
more than half their ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission.
(iv) We observe no signiﬁcant trend in median δwith ﬂux
density. However, χrises signiﬁcantly with increasing ﬂuxdensity. Whereas only 8% sub-mJy ATLBS sources have χ
exceeding2.0, 28% of 1–10 mJy sources have χexceeding2.0
and this fraction rises to 55% for the 10–100 mJy sources.
The sub-mJy ATLBS sources, with 10% sources having
more than half the ﬂux density in extended emission, almost
always have a single compact component, if present. On the
other hand, sources with higher ﬂux density tend to have a
greater fraction of multiple compact components, although
the fractional ﬂux density in the diﬀuse emission might be
the same. This is consistent with population synthesis mod-
els for the diﬀerential source counts wherein the mJy radio
source population is dominated by the relatively powerful
radio sources, which are often of the hot-spot type with FR-
iistructure, and the sub-mJy sources are dominated by the
relatively lower power radio sources, which often manifest
the FR-istructure with a single compact component.
We have computed the percentage integrated polarized
intensity for the ATLBS sources and examined their varia-
tion with total ﬂux density. As far as we know, we have for-
mulated herein a polarization bias correction for integrat ed
polarized emission for the ﬁrst time. We observe an increase
in the percentage polarization in the ATLBS sources with
decreasing ﬂux density. The median percentage polarizatio n
is above 10% in the sub-mJy sources and declines to a few
percent in sources with 100 mJy ﬂux density. We have been
unable to ﬁnd any correlation between the percentage polar-
ization and the source properties like size, complexity or t he
fractional ﬂux in the diﬀuse emission. Since we do observe
a decrease in source complexity in fainter sources, it may
be that the increased percentage polarization in the fainte r
sources is owing to a transition from FR- iidominated popu-
lation at higher ﬂuxdensities to FR- idominated population.
Radio source populations dominated by edge-darkened FR-
ijets or relaxed doubles and relict sources with relatively
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld orientation may suﬀer less de-
polarization, due to averaging over the spatial extent of th e
source, as compared to the FR- iisources that have more
complex spatial structure in their ﬁeld distributions. Alt er-
nately, the increased fractional polarization in the faint er
sources may be due to lower internal Faraday depolarization
if the fainter sources are at relatively higher redshift and the
emission frequency in the rest frame of the source is higher
in the case of the fainter sources. Higher resolution radio
imaging and redshift measurements of the optical identiﬁ-
cations of the ATLBS sources—both of which are currently
underway—might shed light on this issue.
The Very Large Array (VLA) survey of the Chandra
Deep Field South (Kellermann et al. 2008), together with
optical identiﬁcations of the radio sources (Mainieri et al .
2008), suggest that the the sub-mJy radio sources above
0.08 mJy are dominated by non-thermal emission associ-
ated with early type galaxies hosting AGNs. Padovani et al.
(2007) suggest that the dominant population is low-
luminosity AGNs of the FR- itype. The ATLBS study of
radio source morphology are consistent with this view.
The ATLBS survey has indicated that the sub-mJy
radio source population does indeed have a non-negligible
fraction of their integrated ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission .
Therefore, it is vital that deep radio surveys be made with
adequate surface brightness sensitivity to measure the tot al

radio luminosity associated with the AGNs, and accurately
quantify any associated mechanical feedback.
The ATLBS survey regions are being re-observed using
extended array conﬁgurations of the ATCA to reconstruct
source structures with higher angular resolution, to conﬁr m
the ﬁndings presented in this paper and explore further the
radio structural properties of the sub-mJy radio source pop -
ulation. Additionally, the wide ﬁelds are being mosaic ob-
served in the optical and IR bands using the CTIO Blanco
Telescope and the Anglo-Australian Telescope in a study of
thehostgalaxies andtheirenvironments.These observatio ns
and the consequent reﬁnements in our understanding of the
evolution in extended radio sources will be the subject of
forthcoming papers.
