ABSTRACT We present a radio survey carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. A motivation for the survey was to make a complete inventory of the diﬀuse emission components as a step towards a study of the cosmic evolution in radio source structure and the contribution from radio-mode feedback on galaxy evolution. The Australia Telescope low-brightness survey (ATLBS) at 1388 MHz covers 8.42 deg2 of the sky in an observing mode designed to yield images with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. The survey was carried out in two adjacent regions on the sky centred at RA: 00h 35m 00s, DEC: −67◦ 00′ 00′′ and RA: 00h 59m 17s, DEC: −67◦ 00′ 00′′ (J2000.0). The ATLBS radio images, made with 0.08 mJy beam−1 rms noise and 50′′ beam, detect a total of 1094 sources with peak ﬂux exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1. The ATLBS source counts were corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution, and primary beam attenuation; the normalized diﬀerential source counts are consistent with no upturn down to 0.6 mJy. The percentage integrated polarization Π0 was computed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarized intensity; Π0 shows an increasing trend with decreasing ﬂux density. Simultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images, with 5′′ beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. The observations provide a measurement of the complexity and diﬀuse emission associated with mJy and sub-mJy radio sources. 10% of the ATLBS sources have more than half of their ﬂux density in extended emission and the fractional ﬂux in diﬀuse components does not appear to vary with ﬂux density, although the percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with ﬂux density. The observations are consistent with a transition in the nature of extended radio sources from FR-ii radio source morphology, which dominates the mJy population, to FR-i structure at sub-mJy ﬂux density.

INTRODUCTION

Our understanding of galaxy evolution across cosmic time depends on multi-wavelength data, which are products of ultra-deep surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum that have been made using the most sensitive observatories in op- eration. Instrument design constraints and resource limita- tions usually lead to survey strategies that range from all-sky surveys with low angular resolution and sensitivity to ultra- deep surveys of small sky regions that are made with high angular resolution; diﬀerent survey strategies address diﬀer- ent components of source populations and diﬀerent aspects of galaxy evolution.

The radio component of these multi-wavelength cam-

paigns that target small sky regions has most often been done using interferometer telescopes conﬁgured to give im- ages with sub-arcsec resolution that are comparable to or better than the corresponding optical surveys. These ra- dio surveys usually have extremely good ﬂux sensitivity and are capable of detecting µJy emission from distant galaxies. However, Fourier synthesis imaging that is done with widely spaced interferometer elements—in order to image with high angular resolution—tend to lack surface brightness sensitiv- ity, which is the ability to detect faint extended emission components. This is partly due to missing short spacings, which implies missing information on extended emission, and partly because of incomplete visibility coverage, which results in increased confusion. Furthermore, imaging with an interferometer array that has complete visibility cover- age will still have less (redundant) short spacings than a

ﬁlled aperture and hence less sensitivity to extended struc- ture. Consequently, the ultra-deep radio images might fail to reproduce extended emission components associated with galaxies, although extremely faint compact components are represented in the images.

The normalized diﬀerential radio source counts are ob- served to show an upturn below ﬂux density of about 1 mJy (Windhorst et al. 2005) indicating a rapid increase in the number of faint sources at these ﬂux density levels, which might constitute a new population. The bulk of these faint radio sources in the 0.1–1 mJy range in ﬂux density are iden- tiﬁed with early type galaxies (Mainieri et al. 2008), with radio structure believed to be of the FR-i (Fanaroﬀ & Riley 1974) type (Padovani et al. 2007), which often have associ- ated extended emission components. Therefore a complete census of the radio emission associated with faint galaxies, at these ﬂux density levels and at intermediate redshifts of z = 1–2, requires imaging with good surface brightness sen- sitivity. Additionally, the radio morphology of the relatively lower surface brightness extended emission is a clue to the nature of the radio source and is a means of distinguishing between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of diﬀerent classes.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA1) has the potential to detect AGNs, including the radio quiet population, out to redshift z ≈ 6. As compared to X-ray and optical surveys, ra- dio imaging with the next generation telescopes are likely to become the instrument of choice for identifying high redshift AGNs, in particular the obscured AGNs (Jarvis & Rawlings 2004). In this context, it is important to quantify the expec- tations for radio source confusion from both compact and extended radio source components at faint ﬂux density lev- els as this is a potential limitation to imaging with sub-µJy sensitivity. A characterization of the radio sky at faint ﬂux density—in total intensity and polarization—is a useful in- put to simulations of the radio sky and optimization of SKA array conﬁgurations as well as observing strategies.

The survey presented here has been made with the speciﬁc goal of providing a view of the low surface bright- ness radio emission associated with mJy and sub-mJy radio sources, to provide a database for their characterization, as- sessment of the cosmic evolution of extended radio compo- nents and their inﬂuence on galaxy evolution. The surface brightness sensitivity of this survey, which we refer to as the Australia Telescope Low-Brightness Survey (ATLBS), is about a factor of ﬁve better than any previous survey with comparable resolution (Subrahmanyan et al. 2007). In this ﬁrst paper we present the ATLBS survey together with the source counts and a population study of the radio structures. Forthcoming papers will present detailed radio structures, optical identiﬁcations, polarization analysis, and explore in depth the open problems like, for example, cosmic evolution of low power radio galaxies, evolution of the radio source structure with cosmic epoch and the role of kinetic-mode feedback from AGNs on galaxy environment and galaxy evo- lution, where progress depends on our understanding of the low surface brightness radio sky.

2 SURVEY STRATEGY

Deep surveys that target weak extended emission compo- nents and attempt to get close to the confusion limit re- quire good control of systematics. Interferometers are pre- ferred over single-dish scanning surveys because of the in- herent insensitivity to the mean sky background and, conse- quently, the vastly superior stability in the zero-point level that is achievable in images constructed using Fourier syn- thesis techniques.

Extended radio sources usually have steep spectral in- dices and, therefore, it has often been argued that surveys for the detection of low surface brightness sources ought to be made at relatively low radio frequencies. While this argu- ment is correct, there are practical issues that merit consid- eration. At frequencies below about 1 GHz, elements form- ing interferometer telesopes often have poorly deﬁned ﬁelds of view (primary beams), relatively larger sidelobe levels, and confusion arising from radio sources limits the attain- able dynamic range. Additionally, the ionosphere introduces time-varying phase errors that are diﬃcult to calibrate and correct. The available bandwidth is also limited at low fre- quencies. For these reasons, the optimum frequency for deep surveys with high surface brightness over moderate sky areas is perhaps around 1 GHz today, and might move to lower fre- quencies as technology and calibration algorithms relevant for wide-ﬁeld imaging at low radio frequencies improve.

High ﬁdelity surveys for extended sources with low sur- face brightness requires good spatial frequency coverage. Holes in the visibility plane—the uv-coverage—eﬀectively reduces the number of independent synthesized beam areas within the primary beam and, consequently, sidelobe confu- sion due to discrete sources limits the image dynamic range and quality. Most 2D Fourier synthesis imaging arrays like, for example, the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant Me- trewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) have array conﬁgurations optimized for imaging performance in snap-shot mode and in cases where most of the sky region imaged is empty. The deconvolution algorithms implemented in software packages used in processing the data from such arrays also implicitly assume that most of the sky is empty. However, deep sur- veys that attempt to get close to sidelobe-confusion limits require ﬁlled uv-coverage and this motivation has led us to use the EW Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) for the observations presented here.

The ATCA has ﬁve movable antennas on a 3-km EW railtrack. We have used the array to image ﬁelds using four 750-m array conﬁgurations—the 750A, 750B, 750C and 750D arrays. Together, they provide 4 × 10 = 40 baselines and because the ATCA antennas are 22 m in diameter, the 40 spacings provide a nearly complete coverage over the 0– 750 m range. At the 750-m baseline, Earth rotation would move the visibility measurement point through a spatial wavelength corresponding to the antenna diameter in about 7 min. Therefore, the observing strategy was to mosaic im- age 19 distinct antenna pointing positions during a single observing session of 12 hr, cycling through all the pointing positions and observing each for 20 sec so that all the 19 po- sitions would be re-visited once every 7 min. This ensured that the elliptic uv-tracks have complete azimuthal coverage for each pointing. Observations with the ATCA were made using the 20-cm band.

The 19 pointing positions observed during any observ- ing session were arranged to tile the sky in a hexagonal pat- tern so as to cover the sky with a smaller number of pointings compared to a square grid. In the 20-cm band, the ATCA antenna primary beam has a full width at half maximum ′ (FWHM) of about 35 , and mosaic imaging of large angu- lar scale extended structure requires a sky plane ‘Nyquist’ ′ 5. However, we have adopted to sur- sampling interval of 19. vey the sky as a collage of individual image tiles without attempting to image structure on the scale of the primary beam or greater; therefore, the hexagonal-packed adjacent ′ pointings are spaced 28. 6 and this spacing is suﬃcient to cover the sky with fairly uniform sensitivity. The sequence in which the pointings were observed was selected to minimize time lost while the telescope cycled through the pointings.

3 THE MOSAIC OBSERVATIONS

Since our observations use the ATCA with antennas on EW baselines, the survey region was constrained to be at high southern declinations and far from the equator, in order to image with close to circular synthesized beams. High south- ern declinations are also preferred so that the ﬁelds might be far from the Sun, and Solar interference would be minimized at epochs when the ﬁelds are scheduled for day-time observ- ing. To avoid shadowing at the shortest 30-m baseline, the ◦ ﬁeld centres had to be south of −50 declination. On the other hand, since follow-up optical observing with existing southern telescopes are important for the science goals, low declinations were preferred so that optical observing could be through low airmass. Since the ATCA is located at a latitude of −30◦, regions at very high southern declinations were avoided so that the survey might be made at reason- ably high telescope elevations, avoiding problems that might arise from ground spillover in the antenna radiation pattern. High Galactic latitudes were preferred since the background sky brightness and hence the system temperature would be lower.

A 10% departure from circularity in the synthesized beam was considered acceptable, and a pair of sky re- ◦ gions were selected at −67 declination after examining these declination strips in the Sydney University Molon- glo Sky Survey (SUMSS; Bock, Large & Sadler (1999)) and in the Parkes-MIT-NRAO survey (PMN; Griﬃth & Wright (1993)) and ensuring that they were relatively devoid of strong sources. The sky regions selected for the mosaic imag- ing survey, which we refer to as ATLBS survey region A and B, have ﬁeld centres at coordinates (J2000.0 epoch) RA:

′′ 00

The observations of each of these two sky regions were made in the four 750-m arrays and each of these four ses- sions were of 12-hr duration (time shared between the 19 pointing positions). The 20-cm band data were acquired in two 128-MHz wide bands centred at 1344 and 1432 MHz. Each band was covered by 16 independent frequency chan- nels. Multi-channel continuum visibility data were accumu- lated in full polarization mode: the ATCA antennas have feeds with linear polarization outputs labeled X and Y and the polarization products XX, YY, XY and YX are accumu- lated by the correlator. A journal of the radio observations is in Table 1.

The ATCA has six antennas: the location of the sixth antenna—ca06—is ﬁxed and provides baselines between 3 and 5 km with the other ﬁve antennas in the 750 m arrays. The resulting uv-coverage in our observations is completely ﬁlled out to 750 m and is sparsely covered in the 3–5 km range; there is a signiﬁcant ‘hole’ in the coverage between 750 m and 3 km.

4 RADIO IMAGING

The data were processed and imaged using the radio in- terferometer data reduction package MIRIAD. The calibra- tor visibilities were ﬁrst viewed using visualization tools in MIRIAD and obviously erroneous data were rejected. The multi-channel continuum visibility data were calibrated in amplitude, phase and for the bandpass using periodic ob- servations of the unresolved calibrator PKS B2353−686; the absolute ﬂux density scale was set using observations of the primary calibrator PKS B1934−638. Polarization calibra- tion for the telescope were derived from the full polariza- tion products measured on PKS B2353−686. A ﬁrst pass was made on rejecting data with interference using an auto- mated algorithm that examined the Stokes V visibilities and rejected the data corresponding to all polarization products at the same times and channels where the Stokes V visibility amplitudes exceeded a threshold of 4 times the rms thermal noise. The visibility data on the survey ﬁelds in individual baselines, in XY and YX polarization products, were vi- sualized as grey-scale displays of channel versus time, and obviously discordant data values were rejected. The data in XX and YY polarization products were also rejected during these times and for the same channels.

The mosaicing strategy adopted here is to individu- ally image and deconvolve the diﬀerent pointings and then combine them to produce a single wide-ﬁeld image. This approach—as compared to a ‘joint’ approach wherein all pointings are handled simultaneously during the imaging and deconvolution steps—is appropriate in the present case where dynamic ranges exceeding several hundred or so are desired and imaging structures on the scale of the antenna primary beam and larger is not a requirement.

4.1 A low resolution image with high surface

brightness sensitivity

The individual pointing visibilities were separately pro- cessed; ca06 was excluded from this initial analysis that was aimed at making Stokes I images with high surface bright- ness sensitivity using the 0–750 m baselines. As a ﬁrst step images of 4◦ × 4◦ were constructed, which were seven times wider than the primary beam FWHM, so that sources in the ﬁrst sidelobe would be represented. The wide-ﬁeld im- ages were deconvolved, the ‘clean’ components representing sources within the main lobe of the primary beam were iso- lated and their contribution to the visibility subtracted, and then images were constructed representing the contributions from sources in the sidelobes. These features are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the point spread function (synthesized beam) due to azimuthal asymmetries in the sidelobe pattern to- gether with the alt-azimuth nature of the mounts of the ATCA antennas. The response to sources in the sidelobes

were deconvolved and represented as ‘clean’ components— composed of positive and negative components—and this model representing all of the response to sources outside the main lobe of the primary beam was then subtracted from the multi-channel visibilities. In the subsequent re- duction, only the primary beam main lobe area was con- sidered. The visibility data were then imaged, deconvolved and self-calibrated iteratively. Initially the phases alone were self-calibrated, then the amplitudes in the two frequency bands were allowed to separately scale (in an amplitude self-calibration step); this eﬀectively amounts to an ampli- tude correction based on the weighted mean spectral in- dex of all of the sources in the ﬁeld. In ﬁnal iterations the visibilities were self calibrated in amplitude and phase. The processed visibilties were used to image the individual ﬁelds adopting the multi-frequency deconvolution algorithm (Sault & Wieringa 1994); this allows for diﬀering spectral indices among the sources in the ﬁeld and also corrects, to

ﬁrst order, for eﬀects arising from the variation in the pri- mary beam with frequency.

The images corresponding to the 19 pointings constitut- ing each ﬁeld were lastly combined as a linear mosaic, fully correcting for the primary beam attenuation within the mo- saic region but retaining attenuations at the edges of the mosaic to prevent excessive noise ampliﬁcation there. These mosaic images of the ATLBS regions A & B are shown in Figs. 1 & 2 respectively. The images have an rms noise of −1 and the lowest contour level displayed is σ = 85 µJy beam −1 at 3σ. The peak in the image of region A is 104 mJy beam −1. The negative peaks and that in region B is 246 mJy beam −1 in the two images are at levels −450 and −575 µJy beam respectively, which are at the 5–7σ level. The ratio of image peak to rms noise exceeds 1000 and the images show no ob- vious artefacts due to calibration or imaging errors above a level of 3σ.

Images in Stokes Q and U were constructed using the

same baselines and weighting schemes used in making the Stokes I images. In making these images, we followed the ◦ procedure of ﬁrst constructing wide-ﬁeld 4 images, isolating the clean components representing emission from the side lobes of the primary beam, subtracted these com- ponents from the visibility data, then constructed images representing emission from the main lobes corresponding to each pointing position. The images corresponding to the dif- ferent pointings were then combined as a linear mosaic to reconstruct the Stokes Q and U emission from ATLBS region A and, separately, region B.

Additionally, we have constructed Stokes V images of the two ﬁelds. No obvious sources are seen above the image thermal noise. The peak-to-peak intensity ﬂuctuations in the −1, at Stokes V images are in the range ±0.47 mJy beam ±5.5σ; these values are similar in magnitude to the negative peaks in the Stokes I images indicating that the negative

peaks in the Stokes I images are consistent with the image thermal noise.

4.2 A high resolution image of the compact

components

As we have noted above, the 750 m array conﬁgurations have, additionally, sparse uv-coverage in the 3–5 km range as baselines to the sixth antenna ca06. While we have taken every eﬀort to ensure that the low resolution survey is of the highest quality, we may examine the additional infor- mation provided by the baselines to ca06 that could pro- vide some critical information on the compact components in the sources even though the uv-coverage is incomplete. We have used these longer baselines to construct indepen- dent images of the two survey regions with higher angular resolution. However, owing to the signiﬁcant ‘hole’ in the uv-coverage below 3 km in this visibility dataset, the syn- thesized beam has signiﬁcant sidelobes and confusion is a serious issue. Therefore, we have aided the deconvolution by using the low-resolution images constructed using the 750- m arrays to identify the sky regions that potentially contain source components.

The ﬁrst step involved constructing a model represent- ing sources detected outside the primary beam main lobe using all the 750 m array data, including the baselines to the 6-km antenna, and subtracting this from the visibil- ity data. The visibilities were then self-calibrated in phase, using models for source components that were derived by imaging the primary beam main lobe region, and the gains of the data in the two frequency bands were allowed a self- calibration adjustment. The high resolution images were constructed using exclusively the baselines to ca06, which correspond to a uv-coverage that sparsely ﬁlls the annulus between 3 and 5 km. Deconvolution of these images was performed iteratively wherein the search region for source components was progressively widened and the component search regions in successive deconvolution iteration steps was derived from deconvolved images of previous steps. In the ﬁnal deconvolution step the search areas conformed to the regions in the low resolution images—which were con- structed using the 750-m baselines—in which the pixel in- tensity exceeded 0.4 mJy beam

−1 (about 5 × rms noise).

The high resolution images have been constructed using 5 instantaneous baselines per conﬁguration compared with 10 baselines used to make the low resolution images. The rms −1, noise is, therefore, expected to be about 120 µJy beam and this expectation is very close to that measured in regions of the images that are apparantly source free. Deconvolu- tion iterations were stopped when the peaks in the residual image, within the regions being searched for components, −1. This implies that in the reduced below 0.4 mJy beam high resolution images the fractional ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy are deconvolved and restored with Gaussian compo- nents; however, fractional intensities below 0.4 mJy continue to be represented by beams with signiﬁcant sidelobe struc- ture and their integral ﬂux density over the image will be zero.

The size of the restoring beam following deconvolution was determined by ﬁtting Gaussian models to the main lobes of the synthesized beams. The high resolution images of ATLBS survey regions A and B were made with beam

FWHM 4.′′7 × 4.′′5 at P.A. −7.◦8 and 4.′′8 × 4.′′4 at P.A. 3.◦3 respectively. Since the uv-coverage is an annulus, we might expect that extended source components exceeding the size of these beams would be resolved and their ﬂux densities would be severely attenuated in these images. Nevertheless, source components with size less than these beams would be represented.

As an example, a portion of survey region A is shown in Fig. 3, where the high resolution image is in grey scales and the corresponding low resolution image is represented using contours. Most of the sources represented by closed contours also have compact components in the grey scale image; sources that appear extended in the low resolution image often appear to have multiple compact components.

5 PROPERTIES OF THE RADIO SOURCES IN

THE SURVEY

The radio images were scanned, sources identiﬁed, and their radio properties listed by an automated algorithm. The rou- tine IMSAD in MIRIAD was modiﬁed for this purpose. Only the sky region where the primary beam response in the mo- saic exceeds 50% was searched for sources, and ﬂux density estimates were corrected for the primary beam attenuation. Islands in the low resolution images, with connected −1, were considered to be in- pixels exceeding 0.4 mJy beam dependent sources. Thus, the ATLBS source catalogue pre- sented herein includes all sources that have a peak ﬂux den- −1 in the low resolution im- sity exceeding 0.4 mJy beam ages. The centroid position of these connected pixels was listed as the source position and the source name was derived from this centroid position. Sources were automatically clas- siﬁed as unresolved, extended Gaussian or composite based on their structure in the low resolution image and the suc- cess in modeling the images using single-component Gaus- sians. Peak and total ﬂux densities were estimated for each source, both in the low resolution image and separately in the high resolution image. Extended sources without com- posite structure were ﬁtted using single Gaussian models and the ﬁt parameters as well as deconvolved source sizes were derived.

The fractional integrated polarized intensity Π0 was es- timated for the ATLBS sources from the low resolution im- ages in Stokes Q, U and I. Image pixels in which the Stokes I intensity exceeded 0.4 mJy beam−1 were considered, pixel intensities in Stokes Q, U and I were summed separately, a measure of the integrated polarized intensity was estimated Q2 + U 2, where Q and U represent by computing pm = the pixel-summed image values in Stokes Q and U respec- tively, the integrated polarized intensity was set to zero if the signal-to-noise ratio in this estimate was less than unity, the polarized intensity estimate was debiased (as described below) and the fractional integrated polarized intensity Π0 was computed as the ratio of integrated polarized intensity to integrated total intensity.

The measured integrated polarized intensity pm was de- biased with a simple ﬁrst-order correction to derive an esti- mate pe = p, where σp is the standard deviation of the errors in Stokes Q and U image pixels and fp repre- sents the fractional increase in noise variance in the pixel- summed values. To estimate the fractional increase fp, we

The beam of the low resolution image has FWHM 52.′′4 × 47.′′4 at P.A. 6◦ and the beam corresponding to the high resolution image is 4.′′7 × 4.′′5 at P.A. −7.◦8; these beams are shown at the bottom right of the image as an unﬁlled ellipse and ﬁlled ellipse respectively.

assumed (i) a Gaussian proﬁle for the beam and, therefore, a Gaussian power spectrum for the noise variance, and (ii) a ‘top-hat’ function for the integration area and, therefore, a J1(u)/u form for the noise ﬁlter function corresponding to the pixel summation; J1(u) is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. The pixel averaging in the image domain is, in eﬀect, a convolution in the image domain that corresponds to a multiplication of the power spectrum in the transform domain by a J1(u)/u form window. Consequently, the noise in the pixel-summed values would have a variance that is the integral of this windowed power spectrum. The noise vari- ance in the pixel summed values p2 m is a factor fp greater than the noise variance in the individual image pixels, and fp is proportional to

The fractional increase fp versus the number of pixels in the summation is shown in Fig. 4. The ATLBS images have 1.75-arcsec pixels and, as expected, the variance in the pixel summation rises as the square of the number of pixels in the regime where the summation is over an area less than the beam area, where as the variance in the pixel summa- tion rises proportional to the number of pixels in the regime where the summation area exceeds the beam area. The break at about where the summation is over a beam area is be- cause the noise in image pixels is correlated within beam areas and uncorrelated on larger scales.

In the case of extended sources the polarization position angle may vary over the source; therefore, the integration of Stokes Q and U values over sources, which correspond to measurements of Stokes parameters using beams in which the sources are unresolved, may result in low fractional po- larization. The fractional integrated polarized intensities Π0 estimated above treat all sources over the entire range of ﬂux densities as unresolved and these values may be a use-

ful comparison of fractional integrated polarizations versus ﬂux density.

In the case of the imaging using the 750-m array data, the synthesized beam has small amplitude sidelobes because the uv-coverage is almost complete. However, in the case of the high resolution imaging the synthesized beam is very diﬀerent from a Gaussian approximation to the main lobe; therefore, estimating integral ﬂux densities of sources in the high resolution image suﬀers uncertainties and requires care- ful understanding of the inherent limitations arising from the annular visibility coverage and the cutoﬀ level adopted during deconvolution.

Within the search region, the farthest distance of a ′ source from pointing centres is 16. 4. Therefore, owing to the ﬁnite bandwidth of the frequency channels in the multi-frequency continuum data, visibility amplitudes at the longest baseline of 5020 m would be expected to have a worst case attenuation to 0.45 of the true value. Simula- tions using the visibility coverage used to construct the high resolution images and taking into consideration the chan- nel bandwidth corresponding to the observations suggest a worst case attenuation of source peaks to 0.8 of their true value in the high resolution images. We have modeled the bandwidth-related attenuation using a functional form ﬁt- ted to the simulation results and used this to scale the peaks derived from the high resolution images.

In the high-resolution image, the search for the peak ﬂux density is over a ‘footprint’ on the sky corresponding −1 in to the area enclosed by the contour at 0.4 mJy beam the low-resolution image, or the contour at half the peak ﬂux density if this is lower. The median size of the foot- print, for sources with total ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy is 107 beam areas (of the high-resolution image). Our al- gorithm estimates peak ﬂux densities in the high resolution images by searching for the peak within the corresponding footprint. The probability of a spurious peak of ﬂux density 0.4 mJy occuring in the high resolution images and within the footprint area is below 5%; therefore we may consider

those tabulated peaks exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1 as reliable at the 95% conﬁdence level.

The integrated ﬂux density of the sources in the high resolution image were estimated by summing the ﬂux densi- ties in the compact components. An iterative algorithm was adopted wherein the peak within the ‘footprint’ was located, a Gaussian ﬁt made to the component corresponding to the peak and the Gaussian component subtracted from the high resolution image. Successive peaks—including positive and negative peaks—were located, ﬁtted with Gaussian compo- nents and subtracted until the absolute value of the peak residual was below a threshold of 0.5 mJy beam−1. Thus, the listed values of integrated ﬂux densities in the high res- olution images is an estimate of the total ﬂux density in compact components exceeding 0.5 mJy; in case the peak within the source ’footprint’ is less than 0.5 mJy then the listed integrated ﬂux density is simply the peak ﬂux density. A total of 511 sources were identiﬁed in Field A and 585 sources in Field B. The two ﬁelds have a slight overlap in which there are two common sources; therefore, the number −1 peak of sources in our catalogue exceeding 0.4 mJy beam ﬂux density is 1094 over the 8.42 deg2 sky area.

Of the 484 sources with total ﬂux density in the range 0.4–1.0 mJy, 409 were classiﬁed as unresolved in the low ′′ resolution images made with beam FWHM of 50 . Of the 75 extended sources (15% of the sources in the 0.4–1.0 mJy range), 64 were deemed to be representable using a single Gaussian model; only 11 sources were classiﬁed as compos- ite. The fraction of sources classiﬁed to be extended increases to 28% in sources with ﬂux density in the range 1–10 mJy and about half of these sources are deemed composite in structure. As much as 70% of sources in the 10-100 mJy range in ﬂux density are extended, with three-fourths of these classiﬁed as composite. The fraction of sources that are deemed extended and with structure well ﬁt by single Gaussian models is about 15% over the entire ﬂux density range 0.4–100 mJy; however, the fraction that is deemed as possessing composite structure increases with ﬂux density rising from about 2% for the sub-mJy population to above 50% for sources with 100 mJy ﬂux density.

The angular size for the ATLBS sources were esti- mated by measuring the area enclosed by the contour at 0.4 mJy beam−1, assuming that the source has a Gaussian proﬁle, and computing the source width at half maximum. This estimate is expected to be conservative, and yields me- dian angular size of 10′′ for sources with ﬂux density be- ′′ low 10 mJy, rising to 20 for sources in the 10-100 mJy bin. As compared to the linear size distribution derived by Windhorst et al. (1990), the median angular size of the ATLBS sources appears substantially larger and the distri- bution in angular size appears to cutoﬀ more sharply. Most ATLBS sources appear only marginally resolved in the low- surface-brightness images made with beam FWHM of about ′′ 50 , and we postpone a discussion of the angular size distri- bution of the ATLBS sources to later papers where detailed structural information is presented.

A listing of the ATLBS radio sources is in Table 2, where we list the source names and centroid positions, classiﬁcation type using codes ‘P’ for unresolved sources, ‘G’ for resolved sources that may be well ﬁt with single Gaussians and ‘C’ for sources with composite structure.

as well as those derived from the high resolution images are listed. Percentage integrated polarization Π0 is in the last column of the Table.

The absolute ﬂux density scale is based on the adopted ﬂux density of the primary calibrator PKS B1934−638, which is within 2% of the Baars et al. (1977) scale. The ab- solute position of the phase calibrator has been measured with respect to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) using long baseline interferometers (Ma et al. 1998). The calibrated visibilities are expected to have 8% ampli- tude errors because of discrete source confusion within the primary beam during the calibrator observations. As a con- sequence, the initial model images, which serve as an in- put to the self-calibration and also determine the absolute ′′ astrometry might have a systematic position error of 0. 1. Image noise contributes an rms error of (2/SmJy) arcsec in positions of sources, which adds in quadrature to the sys- tematic error term (SmJy is the source ﬂux density in mJy). At the ﬂux limit of 0.4 mJy, the position error may be as ′′ large as 5 or a tenth of the synthesized beam FWHM. The image dynamic range is 1000, which implies that subsequent to self-calibration we may have residual antenna based phase ◦ calibration errors of 0. 8 rms or, equivalently, 1.4% amplitude errors in the calibrated visibilities used in the image making. The errors in peak and total ﬂux density estimates are dom- inated by the image noise for sources below about 4 mJy, and may be as much as 20% for the faintest sub-mJy sources detected in the survey. The listed total and peak ﬂux densi- ties were estimated from the ATLBS low-resolution survey images and the corresponding high resolution images; these −1 re- images have rms noise of 0.085 and 0.12 mJy beam spectively.

5.1 Completeness and reliability of the survey

Reliability of source detection is a major issue in most sur- veys, particularly interferometer surveys that have poor vis- ibility coverage. The ATLBS survey is unique in that the entire survey regions are observed with complete visibil- ity coverage! Therefore, the synthesized beams are well be- haved and the reliability of the survey is determined by the image thermal noise. The noise in the ATLBS images are well deﬁned from the data using Stokes V images: the −1. We have limited the cata- rms noise is 85 µJy beam logue to sources detected with a peak ﬂux density exceed- −1, which is 4.7 times the rms noise. ing 0.4 mJy beam At this level, the Stokes V images have 4 peaks exceeding −1 over the entire survey area and these are in 0.4 mJy beam −1, indicating that about 0.4% the range 0.4–0.5 mJy beam of the sources in the catalogue might be spurious noise peaks and that these spurious sources would be close to the ﬂux limit of the catalogue.

In any survey image, the observed ﬂux density of a source would be the true ﬂux density plus thermal noise. Depending on the value of the noise at the position of the source, the estimated ﬂux density would be altered. When sources are binned in ﬂux density, noise results in movement of sources up or down bins. In eﬀect, the source counts are smoothed by a function whose width depends on the ther- mal noise in the image. In the mJy and sub-mJy regime that is being explored in the ATLBS survey, the diﬀerential source counts steeply decrease with increasing ﬂux density and, therefore, we expect that a net excess of faint sources would be detected because some sources below the ﬂux den- sity cutoﬀ would be noise biased to lie above the detection threshold.

To estimate the completeness and reliability of the ATLBS survey and assess the eﬀect of noise bias on the detection of sources, we have made simulations in which sources were assumed to have a distribution in ﬂux den- sity corresponding to the counts derived by Hopkins et al. (2003). Owing to the image rms noise of 85 µJy beam−1, the expectation from the simulations is that the number of sources detected in the 0.4–0.8 mJy bin would be enhanced by 16%, that in the 0.8–1.6 mJy bin would be enhanced by 2.5% and that in octave bins at higher ﬂux density would be altered by less than a percent. As expected, the eﬀect is greatest close to the ﬂux density cutoﬀ. 18% of the sources in the 0.4-0.8 mJy bin are translated to adjacent bins—13% to below 0.4 mJy and 5% to above 0.8 mJy—but this is over- compensated by sources that are noise biased and translated up in ﬂux density from below the cutoﬀ.

To summarize, spurious sources are extremely rare and constitute only about 0.4% of the sources detected above the cutoﬀ; 13% of sources with true ﬂux density in an octave bin above the cutoﬀ would be noise biased to values below the cutoﬀ and, therefore, would fail to enter the catalogue; however, as much as 27% of the sources detected in the lowest octave bin of 0.4-0.8 mJy are expected to be genuine sources with true ﬂux density below the cutoﬀ that are noise biased to lie above the detection threshold and, therefore, enter the catalogue.

5.2 Confusion and source blending in the survey

A limitation to the reliable detection of discrete radio sources in radio surveys is confusion, which is because the radio image is a convolution of the true sky with the tele- scope beam. In surveys that are made using interferometer arrays and with sparse visibility coverage, the synthesized beams have signiﬁcant sidelobes. Along with the limitations to the dynamic range arising from calibration errors, this makes it diﬃcult to distinguish all of the radio sources in the survey area although they may be above the detection threshold as deﬁned by the image thermal noise. The confu- sion limit on source detection is related to the ﬁlling factor in the visibility plane.

The identiﬁcation of discrete sources in the ATLBS sur- vey was made using the low resolution images, which were made with complete visibility coverage and, therefore, with well deﬁned synthesized beams. The source catalogue that is the basis of the study of the radio source population was also derived from this low resolution image. Therefore, classical confusion and its eﬀects on source selection and complete- ness and reliability are simply related to the ﬁnite resolution of these ATLBS survey images. A measure of the degree to which confusion and source blending result in errors in source counts is how sparsely sources are observed to cover the sky, which depends on the number of beam areas that are observed to be occupied by sources. In the ATLBS low resolution images, the number of eﬀective beam areas per source detected is about 50.

Because of the low angular resolution in the ATLBS survey, confusion manifests in blending of discrete radio sources. We have estimated the ‘blending correction’ from simulations. Sources were assumed to span a range 0.1– 409.6 mJy in ﬂux density and Poisson random distributed over the sky area. A distribution in ﬂux density correspond- ing to the source counts derived by Hopkins et al. (2003) was adopted, which was based on the Phoenix deep survey (PDS). Sources were deemed to be confused if they were −1, which connected by a contour at a level of 0.4 mJy beam was the criterion adopted while forming the ATLBS source catalogue. Confusion between sources in diﬀerent ﬂux den- sity bins, as well as blending of multiple sources, was al- lowed for in the simulations. The high surface density of sources with low ﬂux density and the large sky areas cov- ered by the point spread functions associated with sources with relatively higher ﬂux density together result in a con- fusion between weak sources with the stronger sources. The simulations revealed that for the adopted PDS source counts and the image point spread function corresponding to the ATLBS, confusion results in a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of sources in octave-band ﬂux-density bins below about 1 mJy, and a small fractional increment in source counts at higher ﬂux densities. Based on the simulations, we estimate that the blending correction factor, owing to classical confusion, is as much as 1.2 in a 0.4–0.8 mJy bin, about 1.02 in a 0.8–1.6 mJy bin, and less than 2% in higher ﬂux density bins.

The high resolution images were constructed from sparse visibility coverage and, consequently, confusion is indeed an issue that limits the elucidation of the high- resolution structures. Only 1% of the visibility plane is covered by the data used to reconstruct these images. As

discussed above, the high-resolution images were examined only in the regions where sources were identiﬁed in the low resolution images. Operationally, we have used the low res- olution images to deﬁne the source regions as a constraint during the deconvolution of the high resolution images. This restricted the sources in the high resolution image to be within 2% of the total survey area and resolves the ambigui- ties arising from the poor visibility coverage and consequent confusion in the high resolution imaging. We estimate that even if every one of the discrete sources identiﬁed in the ATLBS survey were a triple, the number of beam areas per source component would be 20 in the case of the high res- olution image. Moreover, in this manuscript we restrict to using only estimates of the peak and integrated ﬂux densi- ties of the high resolution images to derive indicators for the source complexity and diﬀuseness. Detailed high-resolution radio structures of the ATLBS sources, based on followup observations that provide improved visibility coverage, will be presented in later ATLBS related publications.

5.3 The source counts

The number density of ATLBS sources detected with peak −1 is 130 sources per ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy beam square degree.

The normalized diﬀerential source counts derived from the source list are shown in Fig. 5. The total ﬂux densities were binned in octave bin ranges: 0.4–0.8, 0.8–1.6, 1.6–3.2 and so on till 204.8–409.6 mJy. We plot the normalized dif- ferential source counts versus the mean ﬂux density hSi of sources in the individual bins, the diﬀerential counts dN/dS were normalized to hSi

−2.5.

The total ﬂux densities of the sources were estimated from the low resolution image: the Gaussian ﬁt parame- ters were used to infer the total ﬂux densities in the case of unresolved sources as well as those sources with simple structure that were well ﬁt using a single Gaussian model. Composite sources were identiﬁed by the signiﬁcant devia- tion in the image pixels from the best ﬁt Gaussian model— most of these sources appeared to be composed of multiple components—and in these cases the total ﬂux density was derived by summing the image pixels over the source area. During the synthesis imaging that made the low-resolution image, the iterative deconvolution had been terminated at the 1-σ noise level and as a result the point spread function for the residual noise slightly diﬀers from the restoring beam used to convolve the CLEAN components: thus the eﬀective beam for weak sources slightly diﬀers from the restoring beam. The algorithm that does the Gaussian ﬁt was lim- ited to using only image pixels exceeding 2-σ and the ﬁt was weighted by the image pixel intensity to ameliorate the error in the estimation of source ﬂux densities arising from this limitation in image ﬁdelity. Nevertheless, there were a signiﬁcant number of sources with peak ﬂux density exceed- −1—30 in all—in which the Gaussian ﬁt ing 0.4 mJy beam parameters were somewhat smaller than the beam size and the estimate of total ﬂux density for these relatively weak sources falls below 0.4 mJy. The source counts in the lowest bin of 0.4–0.8 mJy might be underestimated by 10% due to this eﬀect, and the error bar for this bin has been enhanced to reﬂect this additional source of uncertainty.

The source counts in the ﬂux density bins have been

corrected for the primary beam attenuation over the survey area by scaling the count corresponding to each detected source by the ratio of the total area of the survey and the area over which the source is detectable: since we truncate at the level where the primary beam drops to 50%, this correction is relevant only for the lowest octave bin and in this bin the counts were scaled up by a factor 1.33 to account for this eﬀect.

logue, which are extended and have total ﬂux density ex- ceeding 0.4 mJy: the derived ATLBS source counts would be an underestimate due to such sources as well. However, analysis of the source structural properties in Sections 5.5 and 5.6 suggests that most sources have simple structures at low ﬂux density levels, at least at the resolution of the ATLBS survey; therefore, we expect any correction owing to extended source structure to be small. If we adopt the model for the angular size distribution of sources derived by Windhorst et al. (1990), which has the median radio source angular size Ψmed of sources with 1.4 GHz ﬂux density S1.4 (in mJy) equal to 2.0S0.30 1.4 arcsec, and an exponential form for the integral angular size distribution, the resolution cor- rections required to be made to our derived source counts are less than 1%.

The ATLBS source counts shown in Fig. 5 have been corrected for the primary beam attenuation, noise bias that was discussed in Section 5.1, resolution and blending; these corrected counts are also listed in Table 3. The second col- umn of the Table lists the mean ﬂux density of sources in the bins, column 3 lists the number of sources detected in the individual bins (uncorrected) and the last column lists the derived normalized diﬀerential source counts corrected for the eﬀects discussed above.

survey counts ATESP to PDS counts 2001) and the ﬁt (Prandoni et al. (Hopkins et al. 2003) are also shown in Fig. 5. The PDS counts were derived from their survey that covered 4.56 deg2 area and the ATESP survey covered 26 deg2 area; these are comparable to our survey area of 8.4 deg2.

As

a

comparison,

Within the errors, the observed counts appear consis- tent with the estimates derived by Prandoni et al. (2001) based on the ATESP survey. The counts are, however, sys- tematically lower than that estimated by Hopkins et al. (2003) based on the PDS: in the ﬂux density range 0.8– 200 mJy our ATLBS counts are on the average a factor 0.8 of the PDS counts. As was the case for the ATESP sur- vey counts, which do not show an upturn and suggest that any upturn at faint ﬂux density levels is below 1 mJy, the ATLBS counts are also consistent with no upturn down to about 0.6 mJy.

At the faint end of the ﬂux density scale explored by the ATLBS survey, blending reduces the observed counts where as noise bias enhances counts. The blending cor- rections, as well as our estimates for the enhancement in the observed counts owing to noise bias, might be overesti- mates because we have assumed the relatively higher counts, based on the PDS survey, for the simulations that estimate these correction factors. Additionally, as discussed above, the counts in the lowest bin might be an underestimate due to missing sources because their peaks may be below the 0.4 mJy beam−1 cutoﬀ or because of image errors arising from the deconvolution algorithm adopted.

A cause for signiﬁcant discrepancies between diﬀerent estimates of the source counts at the sub-mJy levels might be ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld variations. The relatively large sky area, spread over multiple sky patches, covered by the ATESP survey makes these counts a more reliable indicator of counts at these faint levels and there is good agreement between the ATLBS counts and the ATESP counts in the 0.4–1.6 mJy bins: both are systematically low compared to the PDS sur- vey counts.

Australia Telescope Low-brightness Survey

The systematic low counts derived from the ATLBS sur- vey is not owing to classical confusion; the ATLBS counts presented here have been corrected for blending confusion. The low counts, relative to the PDS, could be interpreted as arising due to a 30% underestimate in the ﬂux density of sources, or a 20% reduction in numbers of sources. Since the ATLBS has good surface brightness sensitivity, it is ex- pected that the source catalogues derived from the survey would not have any missing ﬂux density. Additionally, the ATLBS survey is potentially capable of detecting extended sources with low surface brightness, which may be missed in other surveys. The low counts are more likely indicating that the ATLBS survey detects a smaller number of sources as compared to surveys like the PDS. It has been pointed out by Hopkins et al. (2003) that the PDS counts are based on a component catalogue, rather than a source catalogue as was the case for the ATESP counts. Source counts derived from such component catalogues would be expected to overesti- mate the numbers of sources as a result of sources in higher ﬂux density bins degenerating into multiple sources in bins with lower ﬂux densities. The ATLBS survey is a source cat- alogue owing to the relatively large size of the synthesized beam; therefore, it is unsurprising that the counts derived are consistent with that of the ATESP survey and below the PDS counts.

5.4 The fractional polarization in ATLBS sources

As discussed above in Section 5, we have derived estimates for the percentage integrated polarization Π0 for the ATLBS sources using the low resolution images, integrating Stokes Q, U and I over the source, computing the debiased polarised intensity and dividing by the total intensity. The sources were binned in ﬂux density, and the median integrated per- centage polarization hΠ0i as well as the mean ﬂux density hSmJyi of the sources in the individual bins were computed; these values are in Table 4. The errors have been estimated using the Efron bootstrap method (Efron 1979), in which the samples in each bin were randomly resampled with replace- ment to derive a sampling distribution of the median and, thereby, an estimate of the error in the median. In Fig. 6 we plot the median integrated percentage polarization Π0 ver- sus mean ﬂux density for the binned data. The plot clearly shows an increasing fractional polarization with decreasing ﬂux density. This trend is consistent with the observation that among polarized radio sources, the faint sources are more highly polarized than the relatively stronger sources (Taylor et al. 2007).

The binned data were ﬁtted to a power-law to derive

the trend:

hΠ0i = 10.56hSmJyi

−0.565,

where hΠ0i is the median percentage integrated polariza- tion and hSmJyi is the mean ﬂux density (in mJy). The ﬁt is also shown in Fig 6. The data appears well ﬁt by this sin- gle power-law form over more than a decade in ﬂux density; however, there appears to be a ﬂattening above 10 mJy sug- gesting that at higher ﬂux densities the fractional integrated polarization in sources may not change with ﬂux density.

We have adopted a signal-to-noise ratio based cutoﬀ that sets to zero estimates of polarized intensity that are below one standard deviation of the expected noise. Such a

Error bars are ±1 standard deviation. A single power-law ﬁt to the data is also displayed.

cutoﬀ may potentially result in a positive residual polariza- tion bias if the polarized intensity has a low signal-to-noise ratio (Leahy & Fernini 1989). The estimator of fractional integrated polarization, Π0, was separately recomputed as- suming a signal-to-noise ratio based cutoﬀ that set to zero estimations that are below two standard deviations of the expected noise: in this case as well the mean percentage po- larizations continued to display the trend of increasing frac- tional polarization with decreasing ﬂux density, although the residual polarization bias in this case is expected to be neg- ative at low signal-to-noise ratios. This test adds weight to our ﬁnding that the fractional polarization in radio sources increases with decreasing ﬂux density.

ness sensitivity and were made with a beam of FWHM about ′′ 50 . The total ﬂux densities were estimated either from a Gaussian ﬁt to the source image pixels in this low resolution image or, in the case of sources with composite structure, from a summation over the image pixel intensities. Apart from deriving a value for the peak ﬂux density in the low resolution image, we have also separately derived the peak ﬂux densities in each of the sources from the high resolution images, which were made with beam FWHM about 4.′′6.

The ratio of the total ﬂux density, as measured using the low resolution image, to the peak ﬂux density, as measured in the high resolution image, is a measure of the departure of the source appearance from that of an unresolved object ′′ 6. This ratio χ, which we adopt as a of size well below 4. measure of how complex sources appear to be, is a measure of how complex the source structure is when observed with ′′ a beam of FWHM 4. 6. χ is expected to be unity for unre- solved sources, and exceed unity for resolved sources. χ will exceed unity not only in the case of sources with extended ′′ emission that is resolved by a 4. 6 beam, but also in the case where the source is composed of multiple components (which may be individually unresolved). Additionally, χ will exceed unity in cases where the source in the low resolution

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

image is confused, for example, because two or more unre- solved and unrelated sources lie close together on the sky ′′ beam of the low resolution image. As and within the 50 discussed in Section 5.2, such blending is not expected to be an issue at ﬂux density exceeding 0.8 mJy, and the eﬀect of blending on source counts at these higher ﬂux density levels is expected to be less than 2%.

There are 1063 sources in the ATLBS survey with to- tal ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy. The median χ for these sources is 1.28. 20% of the sources have χ exceeding 2.0, ′′ which implies that when observed with beam FWHM 4. 6, close to a ﬁfth of the ATLBS sources are either doubles, triples or more complex sources or have more than half of their total ﬂux density in extended emission components.

In Table 5 we list the median complexity of sources in bins of total ﬂux density. In Fig. 7 is shown the distribution of median complexity χ versus total ﬂux density. The errors listed in the table, as well as the error bars in the ﬁgure, cor- respond to 1 standard deviation errors that were estimated from the data using the Efron bootstrap method (Efron 1979). The bins were chosen to have widths increasing with ﬂux density; bin widths are proportional to (ﬂux density)3/2. Fig. 7 shows that the source complexity increases with in- creasing total ﬂux density. This is consistent with earlier ﬁndings that the median angular size of sources declines to- wards lower ﬂux density, and that fainter radio sources are increasingly compact.

The derived source complexity χ has errors owing to the error in the estimates for source total ﬂux density and the peak ﬂux density in the high-resolution image. Values of to- tal ﬂux density have rms errors less than 20%; errors are less than 10% in sources with ﬂux density exceeding 1 mJy. The peak ﬂux density in the high resolution image has an abso- lute rms error of 0.12 mJy. As discussed above in Section 5, the median source ‘footprint’, which is the search area for the peak in the high resolution image, has 107 (high resolu- tion image) beam areas. It follows that the probability of a chance peak within the ‘footprint’ exceeding 0.45 mJy is less than about 1%. Spurious noise peaks within the footprint, which exceed the true peak ﬂux density of the source, would result in an over estimate of the peak ﬂux density and lead to an underestimate for the source complexity. The estimate for source complexity χ would, therefore, be a lower limit to its true value and this underestimation would be greater in sources with smaller ﬂux density.

If we consider sources in the 0.5–0.9 mJy bin, which has the sources with lowest ﬂux density, the median ﬂux density is 0.67 mJy and the sources are estimated to have a median complexity of 1.19 ± 0.03. For sources in this bin, the proba- bility that a noise peak within the source footprint exceeds 0.45 mJy and, consequently, the complexity is underesti- mated to have a value below 1.19 is less than 1%. Therefore, it is unlikely that image noise causes the median complex- ity of sources in the 0.5-0.9 mJy bin to be as low as 1.19. The eﬀects of image noise are less signiﬁcant in the source complexity estimates at higher ﬂux densities. The low value for the source complexity estimated for the sub-mJy ATLBS population, and the rise in complexity with ﬂux density, are likely to be genuine.

If we consider sub-mJy sources in the ﬂux density range 0.7–1.0 mJy, for which the ﬂux densities all exceed six times the rms noise in the high resolution image, a signiﬁcant num-

ber of these sources may have complexity exceeding 2.0 de- spite the noise. Even if all of these sources have true χ ex- ceeding 2.0, only in about a sixth of these sources do we expect the noise peaks in the high resolution image to re- sult in estimates for the complexities below 2.0. We ﬁnd that only 8% of sources in this ﬂux density range have complexity exceeding 2.0. In contrast, 28% sources in the ﬂux density range 1–10 mJy have complexity exceeding 2.0, and 55% sources in the 10-100 mJy range have complexity exceeding 2.0.

5.6 Diﬀuse emission associated with sub-mJy

radio sources

The parameter χ introduced above is a measure of the de- gree of source complexity, but does not distinguish sources with extended or diﬀuse emission from sources with multi- ple components, composite structure composed of compact components, and confusion.

The high resolution images described in Section 4 were constructed using a visibility coverage that is an annulus ′′ 6; therefore, it is expected and the beam FWHM is about 4.

that extended emission on scales exceeding 4.′′6 would be re- solved out and absent in these images. The fractional ﬂux density in extended emission, which would be missing in the 4.′′6 resolution images, may be characterized by the ratio of the total ﬂux density in the low resolution images to the integrated ﬂux density in the high resolution images. We re- fer to this ratio parameter as δ, representing the degree of diﬀuse emission in the source or, in other words, a diﬀuse- ness parameter. This parameter is expected to reveal the quantum of ﬂux density in extended diﬀuse emission.

The median value of δ for the sources with total ﬂux density exceeding 0.4 mJy in the ATLBS survey is 1.09 ± 0.02; about half of the sources have more than a tenth of their ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission. The median δ is signif- icantly smaller than the median χ, which is 1.28, as might be expected since the complex structure is only partly diﬀuse structure. About 10% of the ATLBS sources with ﬂux den- −1 have δ exceeding 2.0; these sity exceeding 0.4 mJy beam sources have over half of their total ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission.

We have computed the median value of the degree of diﬀuse structure—median δ—in bins of total ﬂux density, where the source total ﬂux density is determined from the low resolution images with high surface brightness sensitiv- ity. In Fig. 8 is shown the variation in δ with total ﬂux den- sity; the values are in Table 6. The errors were estimated from the data, as above, using the Efron bootstrap method. The ATLBS radio source population does not show any sig- niﬁcant trend in the degree of diﬀuse emission δ versus total ﬂux density, although the source complexity χ shows a sig- niﬁcant rise towards higher total ﬂux density. The increased complexity in sources with higher ﬂux density appears to be owing to the sources being composed of multiple compact components rather than increased fraction of diﬀuse emis- sion. The fractional ﬂux in diﬀuse emission appears to be fairly constant, independent of total ﬂux density, at least in the range 0.4–100 mJy.

The total ﬂux density is determined from the low reso- lution images with rms noise 0.085 mJy beam−1. The frac- tional error in this estimate is at most 20%, and less than 10% for sources with total ﬂux density exceeding 1 mJy. The integrated ﬂux density estimate derived from the high- resolution image is a summation of the ﬂux densities in com- pact components with peak exceeding 0.5 mJy; in those cases where no compact component exceeds this thresh- old the estimate for integrated ﬂux density is simply the value of the peak within the ‘footprint’. Therefore, the tab- ulated values of integrated ﬂux density of compact com- ponents, which are used in estimating δ, represent a lower limit to the integrated ﬂux in compact components and may miss compact components that have peak ﬂux density be- −1 in the high resolution image. On the low 0.5 mJy beam other hand, the high resolution images have an rms noise of 0.12 mJy beam−1 and in cases where the source does not have compact components above this noise the noise peak within the ‘footprint’ would be tabulated as the integrated ﬂux density of compact components. There is less than 1% chance of a noise peak exceeding 0.45 mJy within the foot- print; however, peaks exceeding 0.35 mJy are expected with 25% probability. Weak compact components that are missed result in an overestimate in δ, noise in the high resolution image results in underestimates for δ. Owing to the image

rms noise, sources with a given total ﬂux density are un- likely to have δ exceeding an upper bound; for example, it is unlikely that sources with total ﬂux density below 0.56 mJy have δ > 2.0.

We deﬁne the sky area of any source to be the area en- closed by the 0.4 mJy beam−1 contour in the low resolution image of the source. We have estimated the integrated ﬂux density in the compact components in any source by sum- ming the ﬂux densities of all the components in the high resolution image that are located within the sky area of the source. This integrated ﬂux density exceeds the peak ﬂux density of the source (as measured in the high resolution image) in most cases, as expected. The excess may be quan- tiﬁed as the ratio of the integrated to the peak ﬂux density; both measured in the high resolution images. We ﬁnd that this excess increases with increasing ﬂux density. 36% of sources with ﬂux density exceeding 10 mJy have this ratio of the integrated to peak ﬂux density exceeding 2 and 10% of sources in the 1–10 mJy range have integrated ﬂux density exceeding the peak by a factor 2 or more. In the sub-mJy population of sources that have an integrated ﬂux density in the 0.4–1.0 mJy range (484 sources), where estimates of this ratio may be considered to be lower limits, less than 1% of sources have listed integrated ﬂux density exceeding the peak by a factor of 2. This ﬁnding is consistent with a change in the radio structure of ATLBS sources with ﬂux density in which the abundance of multiple compact com- ponents is greater in sources with higher ﬂux density: the fainter sources may be dominated by sources with a single compact component whereas brighter sources have double and triple compact structures.

6 SUMMARY

We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to survey 8.42 deg2 sky area at a radio frequency of 1388 MHz. The interferometer observations were made in a mode de- signed to mosaic image the wide ﬁeld with complete visi- bility coverage, and hence low confusion, and with excep- tional surface brightness sensitivity. The data were used to reconstruct (a) a low resolution image, with beam FWHM −1, and (b) a high ′′ 53 resolution image with beam FWHM of 4.′′6. Whereas the low resolution image reproduces the extended and diﬀuse radio emission associated with sources in the ﬁelds, the high res- oluion image resolves out structure on scales exceeding the beam size. Together, the images provide an estimate of the structural properties of the mJy and sub-mJy radio sources. We refer to our radio survey as the Australia Telescope low brightness survey, and use the acronym ATLBS.

and rms noise 0.08 mJy beam

A total of 1094 radio sources with peak ﬂux density −1 in the low resolution image were exceeding 0.4 mJy beam cataloged and their source properties estimated. The source detections correspond to a density of 130 sources per square degree. The studies presented herein have considered only sources with peak ﬂux density exceeding about 5 times the rms noise in the image.

The normalized diﬀerential source counts derived from the ATLBS shows no evidence for an upturn down to about 0.6 mJy; the ATLBS counts are consistent with the ATESP source counts, but relatively low compared to many other

surveys, including the PDS. This result suggests that there is no substantial population of low surface brightness sources or source components at these ﬂux densities that have been missed by previous surveys. The ATLBS counts—as also ATESP counts—are relatively low compared to many other counts perhaps because our counts are based on a source catalog, rather than a component catalog. As far as we know, blending has been considered and corrected for the ﬁrst time in the work presented herein; blending is of con- cern in surveys such as the ATLBS that aim to go deep in surface brightness sensitivity. The derived ATLBS source counts have been corrected for blending, noise bias, resolu- tion and primary beam attenuation over the survey area.

The derived source counts are consistent with that of the ATESP survey suggesting that the relatively large sky coverage of these surveys is key to robust measurement of source counts. The considerable scatter in the derived dif- ferential source counts at about 1 mJy ﬂux density between the various surveys that were made with relatively smaller sky coverage is perhaps owing to genuine ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld vari- ations in counts. To summarize, the work presented here emphasises the importance of constucting source catalogs, accounting for blending and noise bias, and making large area surveys in order to reﬁne our understanding of diﬀer- ential source counts at sub-mJy and mJy ﬂux densities.

The main results presented in this paper concern the statistical properties of the radio structure and polarization in sub-mJy sources compared to the mJy radio source pop- ulation. We have deﬁned a complexity parameter χ as the ratio of the total ﬂux density of the source to the peak ﬂux density in the high resolution image, this parameter is a measure of the source complexity and the departure of the source structure from an unresolved single compact compo- nent. Additionally, we have deﬁned a diﬀuseness parameter δ as the ratio of total ﬂux density to the sum of the ﬂux density in compact components, this parameter is a measure of the ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission components. These measures of morphology have been computed for all ATLBS sources. The points arising from an examination of the sources above and below 1 mJy ﬂux density are listed below.

′′ (i) In the low-resolution images made with 50

beam, the fraction of extended sources rises from 15% for the sub-mJy population to 28% for 1–10 mJy sources and to 70% for 10– 100 mJy sources. At this resolution, only 2% of sub-mJy sources are observed to have composite structure where as this fraction rises to 15% for 1–10 mJy sources and 50% for 10–100 mJy sources.

(ii) Less than 1% of the sub-mJy ATLBS sources have been observed to have multiple compact components. How- ever, about 10% of 1–10 mJy sources have multiple compact components and this fraction rises to 36% in sources in the 10–100 mJy range.

(iii) The median complexity χ for ATLBS sources is 1.28 and the median diﬀuseness δ is 1.09. 20% of ATLBS sources have χ exceeding 2.0, implying that a ﬁfth of the sources are doubles or triples or have more than half their ﬂux density in extended emission. 10% of the ATLBS sources have δ exceeding 2.0, implying that a tenth of the sources have more than half their ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission.

(iv) We observe no signiﬁcant trend in median δ with ﬂux density. However, χ rises signiﬁcantly with increasing ﬂux

density. Whereas only 8% sub-mJy ATLBS sources have χ exceeding 2.0, 28% of 1–10 mJy sources have χ exceeding 2.0 and this fraction rises to 55% for the 10–100 mJy sources.

The sub-mJy ATLBS sources, with 10% sources having more than half the ﬂux density in extended emission, almost always have a single compact component, if present. On the other hand, sources with higher ﬂux density tend to have a greater fraction of multiple compact components, although the fractional ﬂux density in the diﬀuse emission might be the same. This is consistent with population synthesis mod- els for the diﬀerential source counts wherein the mJy radio source population is dominated by the relatively powerful radio sources, which are often of the hot-spot type with FR- ii structure, and the sub-mJy sources are dominated by the relatively lower power radio sources, which often manifest the FR-i structure with a single compact component.

We have computed the percentage integrated polarized intensity for the ATLBS sources and examined their varia- tion with total ﬂux density. As far as we know, we have for- mulated herein a polarization bias correction for integrated polarized emission for the ﬁrst time. We observe an increase in the percentage polarization in the ATLBS sources with decreasing ﬂux density. The median percentage polarization is above 10% in the sub-mJy sources and declines to a few percent in sources with 100 mJy ﬂux density. We have been unable to ﬁnd any correlation between the percentage polar- ization and the source properties like size, complexity or the fractional ﬂux in the diﬀuse emission. Since we do observe a decrease in source complexity in fainter sources, it may be that the increased percentage polarization in the fainter sources is owing to a transition from FR-ii dominated popu- lation at higher ﬂux densities to FR-i dominated population. Radio source populations dominated by edge-darkened FR- i jets or relaxed doubles and relict sources with relatively homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld orientation may suﬀer less de- polarization, due to averaging over the spatial extent of the source, as compared to the FR-ii sources that have more complex spatial structure in their ﬁeld distributions. Alter- nately, the increased fractional polarization in the fainter sources may be due to lower internal Faraday depolarization if the fainter sources are at relatively higher redshift and the emission frequency in the rest frame of the source is higher in the case of the fainter sources. Higher resolution radio imaging and redshift measurements of the optical identiﬁ- cations of the ATLBS sources—both of which are currently underway—might shed light on this issue.

The Very Large Array (VLA) survey of the Chandra Deep Field South (Kellermann et al. 2008), together with optical identiﬁcations of the radio sources (Mainieri et al. 2008), suggest that the the sub-mJy radio sources above 0.08 mJy are dominated by non-thermal emission associ- ated with early type galaxies hosting AGNs. Padovani et al. (2007) suggest low- luminosity AGNs of the FR-i type. The ATLBS study of radio source morphology are consistent with this view.

that the dominant population is

The ATLBS survey has indicated that the sub-mJy radio source population does indeed have a non-negligible fraction of their integrated ﬂux density in diﬀuse emission. Therefore, it is vital that deep radio surveys be made with adequate surface brightness sensitivity to measure the total

radio luminosity associated with the AGNs, and accurately quantify any associated mechanical feedback.

The ATLBS survey regions are being re-observed using extended array conﬁgurations of the ATCA to reconstruct source structures with higher angular resolution, to conﬁrm the ﬁndings presented in this paper and explore further the radio structural properties of the sub-mJy radio source pop- ulation. Additionally, the wide ﬁelds are being mosaic ob- served in the optical and IR bands using the CTIO Blanco Telescope and the Anglo-Australian Telescope in a study of the host galaxies and their environments. These observations and the consequent reﬁnements in our understanding of the evolution in extended radio sources will be the subject of forthcoming papers.
