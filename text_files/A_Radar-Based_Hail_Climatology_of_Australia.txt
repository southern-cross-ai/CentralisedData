continentisstillcomparativelypoorlyunderstood. Thisstudyaimstosupplementpreviousnationalhailclimatologies,suchasthosebased
on environmental proxies or satellite radiometer data, with more direct radar-based hail observations. The heterogeneous and incomplete
nature of the Australian radar network complicates this task and prompts the introduction of some novel methodological elements. We
introduce an empirical correction technique to account for hail reflectivity biases at C-band, derived by comparing overlapping C- and
S-band observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how object-based hail swath analysis may be used to produce resolution-invariant
hail frequencies, and describe an interpolation method used to create a spatially continuous hail climatology. The Maximum Estimated
Size of Hail (MESH) parameter is then applied to a mixture of over fifty operational radars in the Australian radar archive, resulting in
the first nationwide, radar-based hail climatology. The spatiotemporal distribution of hailstorms is examined, including their physical
characteristics, seasonal and diurnal frequency, and regional variations of such properties across the continent.
1. Introduction
Hailstormsaccountforasubstantialportionoffinancial
impacts caused by natural hazards globally, resulting in
greater than 10 billion USD in insured losses annually in
theUnitedStatesalone(GunturiandTippett2017). InAus-
tralia, hail is typically considered the most costly natural
hazardintermsofinsuredlosses,exceedingthecombined
losses of both bushfires and floods (Schuster et al. 2006;
McAneney et al. 2019). Several of the country’s most
populous cities have experienced hailstorms that resulted
in over 1 billion AUD in losses, including Melbourne in
the south (Buckley et al. 2010; Allen 2012), Perth on the
westcoast(Buckleyetal.2010),andmostfrequentlyBris-
baneandSydneyontheeastcoast(Soderholmetal.2019;
Schuster et al. 2006). Financial losses also appear to be
increasingalongsideanexpansionofthebuiltenvironment

(adjusted for inflation, Eichner 2019). The significance of
these financial impacts underscores the need to quantify
the current level of hail hazard in the region.
Numerous studies have investigated the climatology of
hailstormsinAustraliausingvariousdatasources,includ-
inghailreports,hailproxiesfromweathermodels,andre-
mote sensing observations from satellite radiometers and
weather radars. First, studies based on the Bureau of Me-
teorology’s Severe Storms Archive are limited by well-
documented reporting biases for hail observations (Allen
et al. 2015). Population biases are particularly prominent
in Australia, which has the fifth lowest population density
globally. Theseproblemsarecompoundedbythefactthat

kmofthecoast,leavingvastareas(mostlyinthecountry’s
arid interior) effectively unobserved (Australian Bureau
of Statistics 2021). Consequently, climatological studies
based on hail reports are restricted to more populated re-
gions such as eastern New South Wales (Schuster et al.
2005). Changesinreportingpracticesfurtherdiminishthe
practical value of this data set (Walsh et al. 2016), espe-
cially for more recent years where the archive has been
poorly maintained. The most comprehensive analysis of
hail reports in Australia is provided by Allen and Allen
(2016), offering valuable verification for the results that
follow.
Perhaps the most common approach for estimating the
climatological distribution of hail on regional scales in-
volves identifying “hail-prone” environmental conditions
from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. In
these studies, an environment is considered “hail-prone”
based on a combination of favorable model indices, such
as Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) or 0-6
km bulk vertical wind shear (see Raupach et al. 2023, and
references therein). Such an approach is appealing from
aclimatologicalstandpointduetothespatiotemporalcon-
tinuity of the underlying model data, and has formed the
basis of several global ( e.g., Prein and Holland 2018) and
Australian ( e.g., Allen and Karoly 2014) hail and severe
stormclimatologies. Whilethesestudieshavecontributed
valuableinsightsintothedistributionofhaileventsworld-
wide, they must be interpreted with some caution. First,
theexactformationofthe“optimal”hailproxyvariescon-
siderably between studies and different climatic regions
(Zhou et al. 2021), often resulting in an overestimation of
the tropical hail frequency in Australia (Bednarczyk and

ing their proxy on Australian hail reports, and allowing
their formulation to vary latitudinally, which more accu-
rately characterized hail environments across the country.
However, the accuracy of this approach is limited by the
representativeness of the underlying hail report data set,
which is affected by the aforementioned biases involving
populationdensityandreportingpractices. Moreover,hail
proxies are known to suffer from the “initiation problem”,
whereby only a small fraction of hail-prone environments
(often less than 10%, Taszarek et al. 2020) actually un-
dergoconvectiveinitiation(Tippettetal.2015). Thisissue

demonstrated that incorporating a series of additional en-

Recentclimatologicalstudiesalsoattempttoaddressthe
“initiation problem” by confirming convective initiation
through passive spaceborne observations of deep convec-
tion. Whilepassiveinfraredimagersaboardgeostationary

2019), some studies have used these observations to iden-
tify dynamical characteristics associated with hailstorms,
such as above anvil cirrus plumes (Levizzani and Setvák
1996; Homeyer et al. 2017) or overshooting tops (OT,
Schmetz et al. 1997; Bedka et al. 2010). OT detections
have been combined with hail proxies to produce regional
hail climatologies in numerous studies ( e.g., Bedka et al.
2018; Punge et al. 2021), and although this methodology
likely improves on those derived from hail proxies alone,
significant uncertainty still remains when associating OT
detections with hail at the surface. Bedka et al. (2018)
foundthatonly28%ofOTdetectionsarespatiotemporally
associatedwithhailreportsinAustralia(within1hourand
50 km), which is also considerably lower than 50% in
Europe(Bedka2011)andtheUnitedStates(Dworaketal.
2012). Despitetheseuncertainties,theBedkaetal.(2018)
hail climatology of Australia is a significant advancement
in our understanding of hail in remote areas of the conti-
nent, and serves as a valuable reference for this study.
One final class of satellite-based hail climatologies rel-
evant for our investigation involves hail detections from
passive microwave radiometers and precipitation (Ku/Ka
band)radarsaboardlow-earthorbitsatellites. Studieshaveshownthatsimplebrightnesstemperature(BT)thresholds
at certain frequencies correctly subset hail-bearing storms
in the US with 40% accuracy (Cecil 2009; Ferraro et al.
2015). This principle has been employed to generate sev-
eral global hail climatologies ( e.g., Cecil 2009; Cecil and
Blankenship 2012; Ferraro et al. 2015). Subsequent re-
search with spaceborne precipitation radars by Ni et al.
(2017) revealed that similar to hail proxies, these passive
microwave methods overestimate the amount of hail in
tropicalregionssuchasnorthernAustraliaduetoregional
variations in thunderstorm structure. These insights have

Indirect hail detection methods from hail proxies, geo-
stationary satellites, or passive microwave radiometers
eachhavedistinctlimitations,whichultimatelycontributes
to uncertainty in their resulting climatologies. In light of
these constraints, weather radars offer an appealing alter-
native for climatological hail studies. These instruments
provide spatiotemporally uniform, three-dimensional, di-
rectmeasurementsofhydrometeors,makingthemidealfor
climatological studies, assuming sufficient archive length
and spatial coverage (Saltikoff et al. 2019). When re-
stricted to single-polarized radar data (as is the case in
Australia), the Maximum Estimate Size of Hail (MESH,
Witt et al. 1998) parameter emerges as perhaps the most
thoroughly validated hail diagnostic. Although MESH is

tega2018),ithasbeenshowntousefullydiscriminatehail
occurrencewithinthunderstorms(Cintineoetal.2012;Or-
tega 2018; Murillo and Homeyer 2019). MESH has also
been used to generate numerous regional hail climatolo-
gies in Europe ( e.g., Kunz and Kugel 2015; Lukach et al.
2017) and the United States (Cintineo et al. 2012; Wendt
and Jirak 2021). The latter were created using the US
NEXRAD radar archive, which represents the “gold stan-
dard”forradarnetworksfromaclimatologicalstandpoint,

diverse in terms of archive length, beamwidth, frequency,
andreceivertype(Soderholmetal.2022),andcoversonly
∼30% of the country’s total land surface. To date, these
factorshavelimitedradar-basedhailstudiestosimplediur-

and Sydney (Warren et al. 2020).
In this study, our objective is to expand on previous
work by creating a national hail climatology. To achieve
this goal, we detail how we must address the unique chal-
lenges posed by the Australian radar archive, including3
normalizingdifferencesinradarfrequencyandarchivedu-
rations, and interpolating between large regions with no
observations. Thesemethodologicalelementsareoutlined
in Sections 2 (methodology) and 3 (radar frequency cor-
rection). We begin our analysis at a continental scale in
Section 4, by generating Australia’s first national radar-
based hail climatology. We then identify five regions of
interestwithinthenationalclimatologytoinvestigateona
regional scale in Section 5, providing a more comprehen-
sive analysis for each. Finally, we summarize our findings
and suggest directions for future work in Section 6.
2. Methodology
a. Data Processing
The radar data used in this study are obtained from
Level 1b of the Operational Radar Dataset in the Aus-
tralian Unified Radar Archive (AURA, Soderholm et al.
2022). Our analysis encompasses all available data be-
tween2000–2022,andmandatesthateachradarmustcon-
tain over five years of operational observations in order to
be included. Certain radars have also been excluded due
to data quality concerns, such as geographically remote
radars that did not historically transmit volumetric data,
radarswithpersistentbeamblockages,andvariousairport
radars that are unsuitable for meteorological applications.
Theserestrictionsnarrowouranalysisto52radars,asillus-
tratedinFig.1. Amongthe52radarsexamined,onlyeight
are polarimetric 1and fourteen are S-bands (wavelengths
∼10 cm); both of which have important implications for
our study, and merit separate discussions in Sections 2b
and 3, respectively. The Level 1b dataset contains quality
controlled radar data in polar coordinates, and due to the
single-polarization limitations for most of the archive, the
horizontally polarized equivalent radar reflectivity factor
(𝑍, hereafter reflectivity) is used exclusively for hail de-
tection. Afiltering procedureis appliedto removeground
cluttercontamination(GabellaandNotarpietro2002;Heis-
termann et al. 2013), and radar reflectivity is calibrated
using a ground clutter monitoring and spaceborne radar
comparison technique (refer to Louf and Protat 2023, for
additional details). The latter is particularly important for
our purposes, as calibration errors are known to severely
impact hail size estimates ( e.g., Warren et al. 2020). Re-
centthree-waycalibrationchecksfortheAustralianarchive
(betweenground-based,ship-basedandspaceborneradars,
Protat etal. 2022) havefound that post-correctioncalibra-
tion errors fall within ±0.5 dB, theoretically leading to
acceptable MESH errors of less than 5% (Warren et al.
2020, their Appendix A.).
1TheBureauofMeteorology’sRadarandObservationNetworkUp-
lift program dictates that all newly installed radars are polarimetric. At
the time of writing, 16 of the 66 current operational radars are polari-
metric, with this number expected to rise in years to come.Special consideration must be given for data quality is-
sueswhenusingradardataforclimatologicalstudies,par-
ticularlywhentheclimatologicalvariableinquestionmay
be strongly affected by weak nonmeteorological echoes,
such as chaff, anomalous propagation and sidelobe con-
tamination ( e.g., Fabry et al. 2017). These effects are un-
likelytoimpactourresults,giventherelativeechostrength
and the elevated nature of the observations used to de-
rive MESH (>3 km altitude). A possible exception may
arisewhenspurioushigh-altitude,high-reflectivityechoes
are detected due to ground clutter from elevated topogra-
phy, especially during atmospheric conditions conducive
to anomalous propagation. We contend that these cases
occur infrequently in the Australian network due to the
absence of prominent topographic features (highest peaks
∼1500 m, Fig. 1), and direct the reader to the geomet-
ric justification given in Section 3.5 of Nisi et al. (2018)
for a highly mountainous region. As in previous studies
(e.g.,Cintineoetal.2012),amanualqualitycontrolproce-
durewasappliedtoallidentifiedhailstormsinthearchive,
which eliminated 1342 individual hail detections deemed
spurious by a trained observer. We have determined that
these evidently erroneous radar returns (such as complete
volume saturation of >100 dBZ reflectivity) are likely at-
tributable to hardware or signal processing failures and
predominantly occur in the earlier portions of the archive
for older radars.
The final data processing consideration involves the
amalgamation of overlapping reflectivity observations
from individual radars. Previous studies have highlighted
the importance of integrating information from multiple
radars in order to fill gaps in radar scanning strategies
and compensate for range dependencies (Stumpf et al.
2004; Ortega et al. 2006). However, recent research by
Brook et al. (2022) showed that gridding methods used to
merge data into mosaics can degrade data quality, primar-
ilythroughover-smoothinginthecaseofweightedaverage
methods ( e.g., Langston et al. 2007). Nearest-neighbor
and linear interpolation methods can also propagate ob-
servational noise and introduce first-order discontinuities
into the analysis ( e.g., Lakshmanan et al. 2006). Single-
polarized hail detection methods are highly dependent on
theverticaldistributionofreflectivitycolumns,therecon-
structionofwhichisconsiderablydegradedbybothofthe
aforementioned gridding artifacts. Consequently, we have
opted to regrid reflectivity observations using the varia-
tionalinterpolationmethodoutlinedbyBrooketal.(2022)
for each radar separately in our study, with a grid spacing
of 1 km horizontally and 500 m vertically. This approach
allows for quality control of individual radars without re-
moving or recalculating the resulting mosaic when erro-
neous data from one radar is removed and ensures that

detailed inSection 2b. Wedeemed the regriddingprocess

tion of deep convective plumes, despite the considerable
computational resources required for applying the varia-
tional approach to all hail events in the archive. These
methodological improvements ensure that the gridded re-
flectivities are closest to those at the native resolution of
theradar,wheretheoriginalMESHconstantsweredefined
(Witt et al. 1998).
b. Hail Identification
TheMaximumExpectedSizeofHailparameter(MESH,
Witt et al. 1998) is used for hail detection in this study.Although originally developed as an object-based, single-
valued parameter, we adopt the common approach of cal-
culatingMESHonregulargrids( e.g.,Stumpfetal.2004).
This process begins with the calculation of the kinetic
energy flux based on the semiempirical relationship first
introduced by Waldvogel et al. (1978),
¤𝐸=5.0×10−6·100.084𝑍, (1)
where𝑍is in logarithmic units (dBZ). The hail kinetic
energy flux is subsequently integrated across height levels

We address the discrete temporal sampling rate of
weather radars by implementing an advection correction

2019). ThismethodinterpolatesMESHvaluesalongstorm

the domain by applying the Lucas–Kanade optical flow

contiguous time periods with valid hail detections (vol-

smoothedusingweightedaverageinterpolation(GridRad,Homeyerand
Bowman 2017). MESH estimates are extremely sensitive to reflectivity
biases (Warren et al. 2020), meaning the SHI–MESH relationship de-
rived for smoothed reflectivities is not suitable for the high-resolution
grids used here (Brook et al. 2022)umes with≥30mm MESH), and temporal interpolation
is performed at minute intervals. These time periods are
calculated such that hail detections separated by less than

was selected to accommodate earlier years of the archive
that had 10 minute (rather than five minute) volume sam-
plingtimes, ensuringhail streaks 3froma singlestormare
not artificially split in cases with missing volumes due to
hardware or communication failures.
Our analysis then departs from conventional MESH
studies by adopting an object-oriented approach, where
individual hail streaks are created by contouring interpo-
lated MESH grids at the 30-mm level. Each hail streak
isdefinedbythe30-mmcontourpolygon,andanexample
hailswathcomposedofhailstreaksfromthreeoverlapping
radars is shown in Fig. 2a. We conservatively (relative to
prior studies, e.g., Soderholm et al. 2017a; Warren et al.
2020; Cintineo et al. 2012) limit swaths to a radial range
of 20–140 km in our analysis to mitigate an underestima-
tion of the true hail frequency due the radar’s scanning
geometry (cone of silence and beam broadening). This
conservatism is justified for the Australian radar archive,
given the varying beam widths (between 1–2◦, refer to
Table C1) and the dual-PRF artifacts present beyond 140
km. Apreliminaryanalysisoftherangedependencyofhail
frequencies(notshownhere)revealedthathailfrequencies
wererelativelystablebetweenourchosenrangethresholds
and no obvious underestimation was observed for radars
with larger beam widths. We direct the reader to Bunkers
and Smith (2013) for a more comprehensive discussion of
these effects.
Hail streaks from individual radars are then merged by
taking the geometric union of spatiotemporally overlap-
pingpolygons(refer toFigs.2aand 2b),yieldingspatially
uniform, merged hail swaths. Merged hail streaks are as-
signed a range of statistics, including their area, start and
endtimes,andopticalflowvelocities. Mostofthesestatis-

to ahail streak as “an area of continuous hail with temporal coherence,
which is considered an entity of hail generated within a thunderstorm”.
A combination of spatiotemporally proximal hail streaks may then be
subjectively grouped to form a hail swath for an event.6

tics require an object-based approach, as they may not be
easilycalculatedfromanaccumulated,griddedfield(Nisi
et al. 2018). The resulting merged hail archive ( e.g., Fig.
2c),alongwiththeassociatedobject-basedstatistics,form
the basis of our national and regional hail climatologies.c. Frequency Normalisation
Theprecisearealdefinitionofhailstreaksinourobject-
based approach permits a novel, resolution-invariant
methodforcalculatingyearlyormonthlyhailfrequencies.
In a traditional approach using temporally accumulated
(e.g., daily) MESH grids, hail frequencies can be evalu-
atedattheoriginalgridresolutionbycountingthenumber7
of times each pixel exceeds a mesh threshold ( e.g., Cinti-
neo et al. 2012). However, by chance, some isolated grid
points may not experience a single hail storm throughout
thearchiveduration,leadingtothespuriousclaimthatthe
true climatological frequency at that point is zero. One
may attempt to account for the finite archive duration by
applying various ad hoc smoothing techniques ( e.g., Cin-
tineo et al. 2012; Murillo et al. 2021), or calculating hail
frequenciesonacoarserspatialgrid. Hailfrequenciescal-
culated using the latter approach ( e.g., on a 10 km grid in
Warren et al. 2020) yield higher values, as the number of
haildetectionswithina100km2areaispredictablygreater
thanthenumberateachindividualgridpoint. Thisresolu-
tionbiasinhailfrequenciesprohibitsreliablecomparisons
between studies with different grid sizes [ e.g., Soderholm
et al. (2017a) and Warren et al. (2020)], and confuses the
true meaning of hail frequency estimates.
In this study, we define hail frequency as the number
of times hail is expected at any single point within a grid
box, per normalization period ( e.g., yearly or monthly).
We justify this choice as more intuitive to an observer, as
it attempts to answer the common question: “How many
times per year are you likely to observe hail?” This is
distinctfrom: “Howmanytimesperyearwillithailwithin
10 km from here?” This spatially invariant hail frequency
is calculated by intersecting all hail streaks with a spatial
region defined at any resolution. The cumulative area of
all hail streaks within that region is then normalized by
the area of the region ( 𝐴) and its radar coverage duration
(𝑁, with quality controlled days removed). Formally, hail
frequencies ( 𝑓ℎ) are defined for each region as follows,
𝑓ℎ=365.25
𝑁×Í𝑛

where𝐴𝑖istheareaoftheintersectionbetweentheithof𝑛
hail streaks and the analysis region. Note that for monthly
frequency calculations, 365.25 is replaced by 365.25 / 12

that occur within that month 4. This approach can also be

intersected with the coverage regions (black lines in Figs.
2d-f), and an individual hail frequency is calculated for
each coverage region according to Equation 3. The result
of these region-based frequency calculations is illustrated
in Fig. 2e. Finally, we aggregate all region-based fre-
quencies within each grid cell by preferentially weighting
those regions with larger areas, longer archive durations,
and more overlapping radars ( 𝑅), as these factors all re-
duce uncertainty in the underlying frequency estimates.

to produce resolution-invariant gridded hail frequencies.
d. Variational Interpolation
TheAustralianradarnetworkcoversroughly30%ofthe
country’s land surface, the distribution of which is illus-
trated in Fig. 1. As a result, some form of interpolation is
required to create a continuous hail climatology through-
out the country. This interpolation problem is particularly
challengingduetolargedatavoids,localvariabilityinhail
frequencies, and data noise introduced by the finite sam-
pling period of the archive. Variational inverse methods

sentative sample of the true climatological values.
2. The true climatological hail frequency varies
smoothly in space and time at our chosen resolution.
3. No local extrema lie within data voids, and gaps are
sufficiently constrained by the surrounding data.
4. Hailfrequenciesreducetozeroatsomedistancefrom
the coast.
We will briefly discuss the reasoning behind each of
theseassumptionsbeforeoutliningtheirmathematicalim-
plementation. First, we justify the representativeness of
ourfrequencyestimatesinAssumption1bynotingtherel-
ative length of our archive (average ∼17 years, Appendix
B)comparedwithseminalradar-basedclimatologies[ e.g.,
fouryearsinCintineoetal.(2012)andeightyearsinWar-
ren et al. (2020)]. We choose suitably sparse grid spac-
ing to satisfy assumption 2 (100 km), which theoretically8
dampenshighfrequenciesintheinputdatathroughspatial
averaging and permits the use of smoothing constraints to
“spread” valid information into data voids. Prior studies
of the hail climatology in Australia (eg Allen and Allen
2016;Bedkaetal.2018;PreinandHolland2018),provide
justification for assumptions 3 and 4, where hail hotspots
are not expected outside the current radar coverage or sig-
nificantlyouttosea. Theextenttowhichtheavailabledata
constrains the analysis within data voids will be investi-
gated more thoroughly below.
We choose to perform the interpolation iteratively at
two spatial scales: first at 200 km resolution to produce
a provisional field, then at the final 100 km resolution
using the former as a background field ( 𝜑𝑏). This type of
nested analysis is common in variational problems ( e.g.,
Laroche and Zawadzki 1994; Dahl et al. 2019), and is
useful in our case as valid data spreads more readily at a
coarser resolution, providing a useful background for the
final analysis. The cost function used in both cases is as
follows,

where𝜆ℎis a weighting constant and double subscripts

𝜕𝑥2.
Second-order smoothing constraints lead to a visually
pleasingminimumcurvaturesolution,andthe3-point,cen-
tered, finite difference stencil helps spread valid data into
data voids (Briggs 1974; Shapiro et al. 2009).
Although𝐽𝑠may partially remove speckle noise from
thefrequencydata,Brooketal.(2022)foundthatthiscon-
straint alone is unsuitable for denoising due to unwanted
by-products produced when heavily weighting this con-
straint (oversmoothing and extraneous inflections in data
voids, Shapiro et al. 2010; Brook et al. 2022). Comple-
mentary inclusion of an additional anisotropic total vari-
ation denoising constraint (Rudin et al. 1992) was found
to adequately denoise the data, while damping extraneous
inflections within the data voids and retaining high am-
plitude peaks within the analysis fields (refer to Appendix
B in Brook et al. 2022). The denoising constraint is as
follows,
𝐽𝑑(𝜑)=𝜆𝑑 ||𝜑𝑦||1+||𝜑𝑥||1(7)where𝜆𝑑isaweightingconstant,subscriptsindicatefirst-
order partial derivatives ( e.g.,𝜑𝑥=𝜕𝜑
𝜕𝑥), and theℓ1norm
notation denotes||𝑥||1=Í𝑁
𝑖=1|𝑥𝑖|. Forward difference
derivatives are used by convention (Rudin et al. 1992).
Finally, the background penalty helps constrain regions
outsidethedatacoveragebypenalizingdeviationsfroman
imposedbackgroundfield( 𝜑𝑏). Attheprovisionalresolu-
tion (200 km), the background field is uniformly zero and
onlyappliestogridpointsovertheoceanthroughtheappli-
cation of a weighting matrix that increases exponentially
from0overlandto1outtosea( 𝑊𝑏=exp
−𝑟2/𝑑2	
)where
𝑑is the distance from the coast and 𝑟= 400 km controls
the rate of weight increase). At the final resolution, the
provisional retrieval is used as the background field, and
𝑊𝑏is then set to 1 for grid points over land with no valid
data. Formally, the background constraint is implemented
as,
𝐽𝑏(𝜑,𝜑𝑏)=𝜆𝑏||𝑊𝑏(𝜑−𝜑𝑏)||2
2 (8)
where𝜆𝑏is once again a weighting constant. This con-
straint serves a dual purpose: it constraints the analysis
to zero around the borders of the domain to prevent any
extraneous inflections or boundary effects, and assists in
filling large data voids with values from the provisional
analysis, permitting the use of less aggressive smoothing
constraints to prevent oversmoothing.
Theaforementioneddatavoidsmayleadsomereadersto
question the extent to which the surrounding data actually
constrains the interpolated values within. In an attempt
to satisfy these concerns and justify assumption 3, we ap-
ply the “clever poor man’s error” technique, which is an
efficient method for assessing data coverage in variational
interpolationproblems(Troupinetal.2012;Beckersetal.
2014). The procedure takes place as follows: set all avail-
able data to unit values, reduce the weighting constants
by a context-specific factor, and perform the analysis as
normal. Due to the difficulties involved in prescribing an
exact covariance function for our interpolation procedure,
we assume Gaussian covariance and consequently reduce
the weights in the second step by a factor of√
2(Beckers
et al. 2014). The resulting field approximates the “error
reduction factor” ( i.e., the extent to which the available
datareducesanalysiserrorsbelowbackgrounderrorstate),
where values close to one indicate the problem is well
constrained by the data.
We treat the provision of weighting constants in Equa-
tions6–8asaparametertuningproblem( e.g.,Brooketal.
2022, 2023). Suitable weights are derived experimentally

3. Radar Frequency Correction
A major limitation of the approach outlined in Section
2 is the utilization of C- and S-band radars in the Aus-
tralianarchive(wavelengths ∼5and∼10cm,respectively).
MESH was developed using only S-band radars from the
US WSR-88D radar network, and several theoretical chal-
lenges arise when attempting to apply it to C-band radars.
One primary concern is the increased signal attenuation
due to hail at C-band (Battan 1971), causing the observed
reflectivity (and subsequent MESH values) to diminish
relative to S-band. Various correction techniques have
been proposed for attenuation at C-band ( e.g., Gu et al.
2011), however they require polarimetric data and under-
correct hail-induced attenuation (Borowska et al. 2011).
To the authors’ knowledge, no single-polarized hail atten-
uation correction exists and thus none is implemented in
this study. Instead, we aim to indirectly account for at-
tenuation in a climatological sense using the corrections
that follow 5, while acknowledging the inevitable loss of
information at C-band.
The second major methodological challenge in imple-
menting MESH at C-band arises due to non-Rayleigh
scattering. Both theoretical scattering calculations
(e.g., Ryzhkov et al. 2013) and observational studies
(Kaltenboeck and Ryzhkov 2013) indicate that complex
scatteringeffectsfromhailaremoreprominentatC-band,
reducing the reflectivity response relative to S-band. Re-
cently,Cecchinietal.(2022)refittheoriginal 𝑍–¤𝐸relation-
ship(Equation1,Waldvogeletal.1978,hereafterW78)at
both C- and S-bands using updated mass/terminal veloc-
ityrelationships,whilealsoconsideringthenonsphericity,
varying density and complex scattering effects of natural
hailstones. Their analysis confirmed that ¤𝐸is strongly
modulated by the frequency of the illuminating radar, as
C-band radars are less sensitive to large hail. However,
since the MESH formulation and thresholds used for hail
detection(seeTable1)havebeendevelopedusingtheW78
relationship, these updated and likely more accurate rela-
tionshipsmaynotbedirectlyappliedinouranalysis. This
would require refitting the empirical SHI–MESH func-
tion and hail detection thresholds using hail reports ( e.g.,
MurilloandHomeyer2019),whichisoutsidethescopeof
our study. Instead, we attempt to generate a C-band ana-
logue for the W78 relationship, which aims to account for
the aforementioned frequency biases at C-band while re-
mainingcompatiblewiththeexistingMESHformulation. 6
5We differentiate between a correction made on a climatological
basis(whichaimstooffsetthenetclimatologicaldifferencebetweenC-
and S-band radars) and one that aims to correct attenuation effects for
individual cases.

2018). Theempiricalcorrectionprocedureweapplyinour
study ensures that frequency-related biases are optimally
mitigated between C- and S-band radars.
To establish our empirical correction, we examine six
regions in the Australian archive with overlapping C–S-
band coverage (illustrated in Fig. 3a). These regions were
selectedfromthesetofallC–S-bandoverlaps(refertoFig.
1)duetotheirsufficientoverlappingcoveragearea( >4000
km2) and number of co-sampled hail events ( >100). The
fitting procedure involved extracting time pairs where the
C-andS-bandradarsbothobservedMESH >10mmwithin
theoverlappingobservationregion,separatedbyadelayof
less than two minutes to ensure temporal proximity. The
10-mm MESH threshold was selected to include events
that may be initially underestimated by the C-band radars
but could be incorporated into the 30-mm hail archive af-
ter correction. Once cosampling times were identified,
all reflectivity data above the 0◦C isotherm ( i.e., only re-
flectivities that contribute to MESH) were extracted for
columns exceeding the 10-mm MESH threshold, and the
nearest pixels were matched between C–S bands for anal-
ysis. The pre-correction reflectivity fits for each region
are shown in red in Fig. 3b–g, confirming the theoretical
considerations discussed earlier: C-bands underestimate
hail reflectivities compared to S-bands. Encouraged by
theaforementionedfrequency-dependentfitsdevelopedby
Cecchini et al. (2022), we attempt to derive a similar cor-
rectionempiricallybylinearlyfittingobservedreflectivities
from the two frequency bands in an attempt to normalize
thehailsizeestimatesbetweenthem. Asweaimtoapplya

where Equation 9 was substituted into into the original

fitting technique and additional methodological consider-
ations are outlined in Appendix A.
To illustrate the effectiveness of the reflectivity correc-
tion in Equation 9, it is applied to C-band data in each of
the overlapping C- and S-band coverage regions, resulting
in Cecchini et al. (2022) due to the aforementioned methodological
additionsintheirstudy. Futureworkshouldaimtoassesswhethertheir
theoretical improvements result in more accurate hail size estimates at
both C- and S-band when compared to hail reports.10

bias of -2 dB corresponds to a ∼20% underestimation of

tial spatiotemporal overlaps in Sydney (Australia’s largest
city) mean that the Kurnell/Woollongong (Fig. 3e) and
Kurnell/Terrey Hills (Fig. 3f) overlaps account for ∼41%

to note that the reflectivity correction works equally well
for regions outside of Sydney that contributed fewer data

4. National Climatology
a. Data Coverage
Webeginouranalysisbyevaluatinghowwelltheavail-
ableradardataconstrainshailfrequencyestimatesinAus-
tralia. Figure Fig. 4a illustrates the radar network filled
with unit data following the “poor man’s error” formula-
tion (refer to Section 2d). Significant data voids are ap-
parent throughout the country, particularly in central WA,
northern SA and western NSW. These areas are devoid
of radars due to their sparse population and the fact they
largelyencompassAustralia’sdeserts. Totestwhetherour
interpolation technique is capable of propagating valid in-
formation into these voids, the error reduction factor was
calculated as outlined in Section 2d and shown in Fig.
4b. In general, this quantity is equal to one over land and
graduallydecreasestozeroawayfromthecoastline,where
the analysis is dominated by the background constraint
and the radar data have minimal impact. The influence of
the background constraint also extends slightly inland in
regions with no radar coverage along the coastline ( e.g.,
northeast and southeast WA). Such regions are less con-
strained by the radar data and should be interpreted with
this in mind. It is possible to adjust the variational tuning
parameters to ensure error reduction factors are close to
one everywhere; however, we found that such combina-
tionsarepronetooversmoothing. Wejustifyourchoiceof
parameters by noting that the poorly constrained regions
are small and that the resulting interpolated fields are a
faithful representation of the underlying radar data ( e.g.,
Fig.5). Errorreductionfactorsbeingclosetounityalmost
everywhere over land validates our assumption that data
voids are adequately constrained at our chosen analysis
resolution.
Although Fig. 4b demonstrates that there is sufficient
data coverage across the continent, the strength of that
data coverage is highly heterogeneous. To quantify the
strengthofthedatainregionswithadequatecoverage(error
reduction factor > 0.9), we recalculate the error reduction
factor for each grid point, this time setting the data at that
grid point equal to zero. If the artificial data is placedin a data void, the analysis will be strongly influenced by
it and the result will be close to zero. Conversely, if the
point is inserted into a data-rich region, the addition of
extra data will have less influence, and the result will be
closertoone. Theresultingfieldisthereforeaquantitative
assessment of the strength of radar coverage, with higher
values indicating stronger coverage.
Fig.4crevealsthattheradarnetworkstronglyconstrains

As noted earlier, the interior of the country contains large
data voids, and the radar coverage strength is much lower
thereasaresult. Interestingly,thecoveragestrengthisnot
directly proportional to the distance to the nearest mea-
surement. Forexample,smallradardatagapsinsoutheast

cant drop in this quantity, as they are surrounded by valid
dataonallsides. Incontrast,thecoveragestrengthinwest-
ern NSW drops immediately when crossing into that data
void,asitisunboundedonitsnorthernandwesternedges.
Regionswithweakercoveragestrengthshouldbeassigned
lower confidence, as the data is sourced from more dis-
tant measurements, and the analysis is more sensitive to
measurement errors. The 0.25 coverage strength contour
from Fig. 4c is hatched in Figs. 5b and 6 to illustrate the
fact that both data coverage and coverage strength should
be taken into account when interpreting the subsequent
national climatology.
b. Annual Hail Frequency
Having discussed the intricacies of the chosen interpo-
lationprocedure,wepresenttheresultinginterpolatedhail
climatology in Fig. 5. The most notable feature is the
broad hail frequency maximum located on the east coast
of Australia, roughly situated south of Mackay in south-
east Queensland and north of Sydney in northeast New
South Wales. The highest hail frequencies are observed
close to the coastline south of Brisbane, proximal to the
Great Dividing Range (topography illustrated in Fig. 1).
These findings are consistent with previous studies in the
Australianregion( e.g.,AllenandAllen2016;Bedkaetal.
2018). The position and size of this hail-prone region is
similar to the hail environment-filtered overshooting top
climatology in Bedka et al. (2018), but extends slightly
further inland than their study suggests. This inland prop-
agationispartiallyinfluencedbyahighnumberofobserved
events in southwestern NSW (near the SA/NSW/VIC bor-
der,Fig.5a). Manualqualitycontrolaffirmsthelegitimacy
of these events, but the frequency disparity compared to
the surrounding region suggests that this feature may be a
climatological anomaly. Although the interpolation pro-
cedure smooths such features towards the “climatological
mean”,theanomalousinformationstillpropagatesintothe
data void in western NSW. The limited data strength in

this hail maximum extends. The recent installation of two
radars (Hillston and Brewarrina) largely fills the western

as more data become available in years to come.
Radar-basedhailfrequenciesdropoffappreciablysouth
of Sydney, with annual frequencies on the order of 0.05
year−1acrossVictoriaandsouthernSouthAustralia. Hail-
storms in this region are known to be associated with the
passage of frontal systems, which can initiate thunder-
storms in otherwise marginal environments. Zhou et al.
(2021) demonstrated that these low instability and mod-
erate to high shear hail environments are dominant in the
high latitudes, where cooler temperature profiles also in-
crease the likelihood of hailstones reaching the surface.
Previous remote sensing studies have suggested that these
relatively shallow hailstorms may result in an underes-
timation of hail frequencies in southern regions such as
Melbourne and Canberra (Bedka et al. 2018; Punge et al.
2018). While there are numerous hail reports in these ar-
eas(e.g.,Bedkaetal.2018),thereportedsizesaresmaller
on average, reflecting less hail growth due to reduced pre-
cipitable water and weaker instability (Allen and Allen
2016). As a result, a greater proportion of hailstorms and
hail reports will be correctly overlooked by our 30-mm
MESH threshold. It is also possible that MESH is poorly
calibratedfordetectinglargehailduetothesestructuraldif-
ferences and underestimates the true frequency of hail in
southernAustralia(havingbeenempiricallyfittohailsize
reportsinOklahomaandFlorida,Wittetal.1998). Future
work should investigate the relative accuracy of MESHestimatesagainsthailreportsfordifferenthigh-population

Onthewestcoast,radarcoverageislimitedtothecoast-

elevated hail frequencies ( >0.1 yr−1), the first along the
coastlinebetweenExmouthandBroomeandthesecondin
the Goldfields region around Kalgoorlie. Both signatures
appear fragmented in the observed radar frequencies (Fig.
5a), with disparate frequencies detected at adjacent grid
points. Once again, the interpolation procedure tempers
isolated high-frequency points to estimate the climatolog-
ical mean. The result is a broad region of elevated hail
frequency from Broome to Exmouth and around Kalgo-
orlie. Notably, the latter does not extend to the coastline
in the south near Perth, Australia’s fourth most populous
city. The land–sea contrast is especially apparent on the
north coast of WA, where hail frequencies over the ocean
are nearly zero, consistent with climatologically high val-
uesofconvectiveinhibition(CIN)observedoffshoreinthe
region (Riemann-Campe et al. 2009). Other minor hail
frequency maxima are observed by radars in central Aus-
tralia near Alice Springs, and in northwest Queensland.
The former region coincides with a collection of hail re-
ports in the Australian Severe Storms Archive (Allen and
Allen2016),althoughitisnotidentifiedinpreviousstudies

and Kuleshov 2014; Bang and Cecil 2019). Bedka et al.

maximum near Burketown is also observed in the light-
ning climatology record of Dowdy and Kuleshov (2014),
and is probably associated with low-level convergence in
the Queensland heat low (Sturman and Tapper 1996) and
the onshore passage of cloud lines from the Gulf of Car-
pentaria (Drosdowsky and Holland 1987).

methodologies tend to overestimate hail occurrence in the
tropics. These methods include satellite brightness tem-
peratures ( e.g., Bang and Cecil 2019), overshooting tops
(e.g.,Bedkaetal.2018)andhail/severestormproxies( e.g.,
PreinandHolland2018). Allsuchmethodsaresensitiveto

responsible for the absence of hail in the region. Firstly,
vigorouswarm-rainprocessesbelowthefreezinglevelare
thoughttosimultaneouslylimittheamountofsupercooled
liquid water and increase the number of competing hail
embryosinthehailgrowthzone(Cottonetal.2010). Sec-ond, the lack of wind shear in the tropics ( e.g., Allen and
Allen 2016; Zhou et al. 2021) means that hail-producing
storms are comparatively shorter-lived, as outflows from
mature cells disrupt their own inflows (May et al. 2002).
Thesestructuraldifferenceslikelyreducethepotentialup-
draftresidencetime,whichiscriticalforhailgrowth( e.g.,
Kumjian et al. 2021).
Bothstructuralandmicrophysicallimitationsdiscussed
here dictate that hail observed aloft is mostly small (1–2
cm, May et al. 2002), and likely melts before reaching the
surface due to typical temperature profiles in the tropics
(Foote 1984). To the contrary, Bang and Cecil (2021)
demonstrated that spaceborne Ku-band radar reflectivity
profilesaremostlyconsistentacrosstropicalandsubtropi-
calhailstormsidentifiedusingdifferentpassivemicrowave

duetocomplexscatteringandattenuationatKubandradar
frequencies, which reduces the reflectivity response for
larger hail sizes relative to S-band and limits the informa-
tioncontentavailableforhailsizediscrimination(Ryzhkov
et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2013). A notable finding in Section
3 is the substantial impact of these effects at C-band fre-
quencies, implying even more pronounced consequences
at Ku-band. Additionally, the results presented here in-
dicate that unlike Ku-band radars, ground-based S-band14
and corrected C-band radars effectively distinguish larger
hydrometeors likely to reach the ground without melting,
thereby minimizing the overestimation of hail frequencies
in tropical regions. Admittedly, this analysis is limited to
the available radar coverage, which excludes most of the
Kimberley coast region in northwest Australia (see Fig.
1)7, where other remotely sensed hail ( e.g., Bang and Ce-
cil2019)andseverestormclimatologies( e.g.,Dowdyand
Kuleshov 2014) notably highlight as a hotspot. However,
basedonthefindingsinSection4a,weexpectthattheavail-
able radar data adequately constrains hail frequency esti-
mates across tropical Australia. The ground-radar-based
assessment of tropical hail frequency shown here appears
realistic when compared to Severe Storm Archive hail re-
ports(AllenandAllen2016)andalignsquantitativelywith
a 20-year climatology compiled from press reports by the
Queensland Regional Meteorological Office (Frisby and
Sansom 1967), with the 1-in-10 year (0.1 yr−1) and 1-in-
20 year (0.05 yr−1) isolines terminating around Mackay
and Cairns, respectively.
c. Hail Seasonality
The final result presented in this section concerns the
seasonality of the Australian hail climatology. Fig. 6
presents interpolated monthly hail frequencies, calculated
using normalized months to ensure an even sample size
for each month. Segmenting the historical archive in this
manner naturally limits the data available for each inter-
polation, potentially challenging our assumption that the
observed data are a sufficiently representative sample of
theactualclimatologicalhailfrequency. Theselimitations
can lead to “patchy” hail frequencies for months such as
November and February (Figs. 6e and 6h, respectively),
which appear to be affected by climatological anomalies
that arise due to the limited duration of the archive. We
proceed in discussing the seasonal climatology with these
limitations in mind.
While some hail activity is observed on the east coast
as early as September, the hail season begins in earnest
in October. Early season events are mostly concentrated
in southern Queensland and progressively move south as
the season advances. Note that the gap observed between
Brisbane and Sydney in December and January likely re-
flectsthelackofradarobservationsintheregion(Fig.5a).
By February, the East coast hail frequency maximum has
shiftedsouthtoaroundSydney,showingasteadypoleward
trend in the intervening months. This aligns with global
satellite observations made by Zhou et al. (2021), who
suggested that the poleward shift coincides with increases
intemperatureandmoistureathigherlatitudesthroughout
thesummer. Locally,AllenandKaroly(2014)andWarren
et al. (2020) showed how these effects lead to a poleward

Peninsula on the western fringe of the Kimberleys.shift in instability as the Austral summer progresses, par-
ticularlyalongtheeastcoast. Conversely,theweakeningof
lapse rates in the absence of favorable upper-level support
results in an overall reduction in hail-producing instabil-
ity/shear environments in Queensland as the summer pro-
gresses (Allen and Karoly 2014; Warren et al. 2020). As
a result, the seasonal cycle is comparatively broader and
laterinNSW(November–March),afindingthatisalsore-
flected in hail reports from greater Sydney (Schuster et al.
2005).
Outside the east coast maximum, hail frequencies in-
crease markedly throughout the country in November.
This timing coincides with the arrival of continental heat
troughs and their associated moisture transport to much
of inland Australia (Sturman and Tapper 1996; Hung and
Yanai 2004). This moisture, along with suitable upper-
level support during late spring or early summer, provides
favorableconditionsforhailactivityinthosemonths,rem-
iniscent of the seasonal climatology of convection in the
GreatPlainsoftheUnitedStates(Fabryetal.2017). Under
this hypothesis, the collective reduction in hail activity in
January–Februaryisaresultofawarmerupperatmosphere
as the summer progresses. Allen and Karoly (2014) also
cited the importance of inland troughs in mid to late sum-
merforstormdevelopmentacrossinlandWesternAustralia
(WA). Hailstorms on the west coast of the country remain
subdued until later in the season around February, consis-
tentwiththeovershootingtop-basedclimatologyofBedka
et al. (2018). It is also worth noting that the only major

curred similarly late in the season (March 2010, Buckley

most of the country, likely due to their association with
strong frontal systems that are capable of triggering hail-

(Allen and Karoly 2014).
5. Regional Analysis
HavingpresentedthenationalclimatologyinSection4,
fiveregionsofinterestwereidentifiedforfurtherinvestiga-
tion in this section. These regions were selected based on
the discussion in Section 4 ( e.g., northwest Australia and
theGoldfieldsregions)andtheirsignificanceaspopulation
centers(e.g.,BrisbaneandSydney). Wehaveincreasedthe
spatial resolution of the regional climatologies to a 10 km
grid;however,thisislimitedtoareaswithinradarcoverage
in the absence of spatial interpolation.
The first region of interest is situated in northwest Aus-
tralia,encompassingtheBroomeandPortHedlandradars.
The high resolution climatology in Fig. 7a reveals a pro-
nounced land–sea contrast, with elevated hail frequencies
beginning roughly 10–30 km inland from the coastline.
This highlights the important role of sea breeze circula-
tions for thunderstorm initiation in the tropical Australia15

seacontrastmayalsoreflecttheclimatologicallyhighval-
ues of CIN offshore (Riemann-Campe et al. 2009) that
acts to suppress convection even in the presence of strong
low-level convergence ( e.g., associated with land breezes;
Wapler and Lane 2012). Fig. 7f shows that once storms
do initiate, most move toward the west, associated with
easterly trade winds or monsoon return flow, depending
on the time of year. While storms do initiate inland and
generallymoveoffshore,Fig.7ashowsthatalmostalldis-
sipatebeforereachingthecoastline. Fig.8aalsoshowsthat

further substantiating the ephemeral nature of hailstorms
in the region. The seasonal distribution of hailstorms in
theregionisdistinctlybimodal(Fig.8b),withthebreakinDecember coinciding with the average arrival of the mon-
soon (Hung and Yanai 2004). It is likely that increases
in column-integrated moisture and weaker lapse rates as-
sociated with the active monsoon suppress hail activity
during this period. It remains unclear whether MESH de-
tectionsaresubstantiatedbyhailfallatthesurfaceinthese

sity. However, the coastal offset illustrated in Fig. 7a may

from the coastline is similar to northwest Australia, albeit
with increased offshore activity in the southern parts of
the domain. Unlike coastal population centers on the west
coast,non-zerohailfrequenciesextendtothecoastlinenear
Mackay, which notably recorded Australia’s largest mea-
sured hailstone nearby in 2021 (16 cm in diameter, BoM
2021). Fig.7gshowsthatstormspredominantlymoveoff-

latitudes. These types of systems typically occur in late
spring and early summer (Section 4), before the monsoon
regime draws in tropical air masses from the east later in
the season (Sturman and Tapper 1996). Figs. 8a and 8c
alsoconfirmthat,similartothenorthwestAustraliaregion,
these tropical hail events are shorter in length and occur
later in the day than their subtropical counterparts. The
comparativelylatediurnalcycleinthetropics(bothnorth-
westernandnortheasternregions,usuallybetween4–6pmlocal time) is consistent with that of overshooting convec-
tioninotherlocationsinnorthernAustraliasuchasCairns

The next region of interest coincides with the na-
tional hail frequency maximum in southeast Queens-
land/northeastNewSouthWales. Thisregioncontainsthe
highest hail frequencies on the continent, consistent with
prior hail climatologies (McMaster 2001; Schuster et al.
2005; Bedka et al. 2018). The maximum hail frequency
west of Casino in Fig. 7c also aligns closely with the re-
gional MESH-based climatology in Warren et al. (2020).
It is difficult to compare the maximum frequency values
observed (2.5 hail days per year per 100 km2in Warren
et al. (2020) versus ∼0.9 hailstorms per year here) due to
methodological differences used for frequency estimation
in both studies (see Section 2c). The highest hail fre-
quencies occur on either side of the QLD/NSW border,
which follows the ridge top of the McPherson mountain
range. The observed hail maxima along sloping terrain,17

rather than mountain peaks, is consistent with local thun-
derstorminitiationhypotheses,includingthermallydriven
valley winds, orographic lifting, and leeward convergenceofobstructedflows(SturmanandTapper1996;Soderholm
et al. 2017a; Nisi et al. 2018; Warren et al. 2020). A sec-
ondary hail maximum to the northwest of Brisbane was18
also observed by Soderholm et al. (2017a), who hypothe-
sizedthatstormintensificationmaybepromotedbylatent
heat fluxes from nearby Lakes Wivenhoe and Somerset.
Fig. 7h indicates predominantly northeasterly storm mo-
tion, consistent with the dominant westerly steering flow
in the subtropics and influence of southerly airmasses for
high-end thunderstorm events in the region (Soderholm
et al. 2019). Previously identified southwest–northeast
stormpathwaysmaybeidentifiedinFig.7c( e.g.,fromthe
border ranges toward Brisbane, Soderholm et al. 2017a;
Warren et al. 2020), along with a prominent storm path-
way off the coast east of Casino.
Hail frequencies are generally concentrated on the
coastal plain to the east of the Great Dividing Range in
Fig. 7c. Along with the previously mentioned initiation
mechanisms, this region is thought to be more favorable
for hailstorms due to interactions with sea breezes (which
supplement low-level moisture and wind shear), and more
localized factors such as added latent heat fluxes from
irrigated farmland and urban heat island effects (Soder-
holmetal.2017a,b). Accordingly,hailfrequenciesreduce
substantially onto the elevated New England Tableland in
northeastern NSW, which is roughly traced by the 750 m
elevation contour in Fig. 7c. 8Hail frequencies appear to
drop spuriously in regions solely covered by the Grafton
radar, which is known to display persistently poor calibra-
tion and hardware-related insensitivity (M. Curtis, 2023,
personal communication, Bureau of Meteorology). De-
spite these issues, Grafton data were included in Fig. 7 to
illustratehailfrequenciesinarelativesenseacrossnorthern
NSW, due to the region’s importance as a climatological
hail maximum (see Fig. 5). The Grafton radar was not
included in the national climatology (Appendix B) due to
these reasons.
The pattern of hail activity along the southern stretches
oftheNSWcoastline,aroundSydney,depictedinFig.7dis
generally similar to that in northeastern NSW. Hailstorms
are concentrated on the coastal plain, with a particular
prevalence on the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing
Range. Hail frequencies appear to diminish atop elevated
topography ( >750 m), preferring mountain slopes rather
thanpeaks. Asaresult,hailfrequenciesdropoffconsider-
ablyintheSnowyMountainssouthofCanberra,andmore
broadly south of Sydney. Schuster et al. (2005) also noted
a marked drop in hail reports to Sydney’s south, despite
the large population density. Fig. 7i supports the general
pictureofhailactivityintheregion,wherebystormsiniti-
ate along the ranges to the east, before tracking eastward,
intensifying across the coastal plain, and finally dissipat-
ing over the ocean (Potts et al. 2000; Schuster et al. 2005;

8Interestingly, older report-based climatologies indicate that the
number of hail reports and crop losses are comparable between the
NewEnglandTablelandandthecoastalplain(McMaster2001;Schuster
et al. 2005), likely a result of their earlier study periods.commonintheSydneyregioncomparedtoBrisbane(War-
ren et al. 2020), aligning with the increased prevalence
of lightning offshore in the region (Dowdy and Kuleshov
2014).
The final region of interest is the Goldfields region in
southwestern Australia (Fig. 7e). The temperate climate
and proximity to the southern ocean dictate that strong
frontal systems are a dominant driver of storm activity in
the region (Sturman and Tapper 1996; Allen and Karoly
2014). As a result of these broad-scale initiation mecha-
nisms, hail frequencies are generally quite uniform spa-
tially, with a less-pronounced land–sea contrast. The

southern WA are notably longer than those in the rest of
the country.
6. Summary and Future Directions
This study aimed to develop a national radar-based
hail climatology with a broad focus on the national- and
regional-scales. ChallengesuniquetotheAustralianradar
archive (e.g., varying radar frequencies and limited spa-
tial coverage) complicated these endeavors, and various
methodologicaladvanceswererequiredtoachievetheob-
jectives of the study. The main methodological contribu-
tions outlined in this study are as follows:
•The introduction of an object-based hail process-
ing algorithm enabled the calculation of resolution-
invariant hail frequencies, which are more intuitive
for individual observers and enable intercomparison
between studies.
•A hail reflectivity correction was proposed for cal-
culating Maximum Estimated Size of Hail (MESH)
estimates at C-band, minimizing climatological dif-
ferences with S-bands in the Australian archive.
•A novel variational method for interpolating radar-
based hail frequencies across the country was intro-
duced to produce a spatially continuous national hail
climatology.
Thesemethodologicaladvancespermittedtheinvestiga-
tionofhailoccurrenceacrosstheaforementionedrangeof
spatialscales. First,thehailfrequencieswereestimatedon
anationalscaleinSection4,andshowedabroadhailmax-
imum on the east coast of the country between roughly19
Mackay and Sydney. The radar-based archive indicates
that hailstorms occur once every 3–5 years at individual
locations on the east coast. Elevated hail frequencies also
occuronthenorthwestcoastandinlandstretchesofsouth-
west Australia, but are less than half as frequent as those
on the east coast.
Regional climatologies showed that hailstorms occur
mostfrequentlyontheeasternslopesoftheGreatDividing
Range around the Brisbane and Sydney regions (one hail
event every∼1–2 years). Tropical hailstorms were found
tobeshorterintermsoflengthandinitiatelaterintheday
with a strong land–sea contrast. Subtropical hailstorms
on the East coast were found to shift poleward through-
out the summer, starting in Queensland in November and
progressing toward Sydney by March. Finally, temperate
hailstormsinsouthernAustraliawereobservedtoproduce
longerhailstreaksandmainlypropagatetowardthesouth-
east, corresponding with known synoptic-scale drivers in
the region.
During this study, several important avenues for future
work were identified. First, secondary data sources, such
as hail proxies from weather models or various satellite-
based products, should be used to help constrain hail fre-
quency estimates in areas with poor radar coverage, such
as western New South Wales. These data sources may be
incorporatedasanadditionalbackgroundconstraintinthe
variational interpolation method introduced herein. Fur-
therresearchshouldalsoinvestigatetheaccuracyofMESH
for hail identification in different climatic regions such as
the tropics and southern Australia, using hail both hail
reportsandcomparisons withsatellite-basedremotesens-
ing products. These studies should also investigate how
storm-driven hail advection, melting, and size sorting can
also affect radar-based climatological assessments ( e.g.,
Brook et al. 2021). Finally, future research should also
explore how the radar archive may be used to identify
long-term trends and interannual/decadal variability pre-
viously noted in the Australian hail climatology (Schuster
et al.2005; Allenand Karoly2014), in thecontext ofhow
they may be evolving in a changing climate.

Iterative Orthogonal Linear Regression
Weexpectthereflectivityresponseoflargehailtodimin-
ish at C-band due the theoretical considerations outlined
in Section 3. Here, we attempt to correct C-band hail re-
flectivities to match that at S-band, where the chosen hail
detection methodology was developed. The fitting proce-
dure used to generate the correction is a linear orthogonal
regression. This technique is suitable for our purposes, as
it considers measurement error in both 𝑥and𝑦variables,
whichisdistinctfromanordinaryleastsquaresregressionthat assumes the 𝑥variable is known without error. Or-
thogonalregressionisalsosuitableforourapplicationdue
to our use of point-matched values of the same variable,
which, due to the identical matching procedure employed
toboth,wemayassumetohaveequalvariance(York1966).
Carroll and Ruppert (1996) show that orthogonal regres-
sionmaybemisusediftheratioofinputvariablevariance

Theaimistofitonlythosereflectivitiesthatcorrespond

above the 0◦C isotherm in columns where MESH exceeds
10 mm (refer to Section 3 for a discussion on the 10-mm
MESHthreshold). Wealsoonlyusedataabove40dBZ,as
in the MESH formulation. Orthogonal regression is used
to fit C- and S-band reflectivities as the 𝑥and𝑦variables,
respectively, resulting in a standard linear function : 𝑦=
𝑚𝑥+𝑐, where𝑚and𝑐are the linear coefficients. When
the correction is applied to the 𝑦data, the initial fit is
transposed as follows:
𝑌1=𝑦0−𝑐1
𝑚1(A1)
where𝑌denotes the corrected 𝑦data,𝑦0is the initial 𝑦
data and subscripts denote the nthcorrection. Depending
on the sign of the correction, 𝑌1may now contain data
above or below the 40 dBZ threshold, which should be
included or excluded from the fitting calculation, respec-
tively. This problem is analogous to one encountered in
radarcalibration,wherespacebornereflectivitydataabove
a certain threshold are used to calculate a calibration off-
set (Protat et al. 2011; Warren et al. 2018). The solution
arises by proceeding iteratively, applying the correction
and filtering the data according to the threshold at each
step. The linear corrections in our case introduce addi-
tionalcomplexity(comparedtotheconstantoffsetusedin
radar calibration), and we now describe how the final cor-
rectionmaybeobtainedfromthefitateachiteration. Once
the 40 dBZ threshold has been applied to 𝑌1, we recorrect
the data in the second iteration:
