ABSTRACT
A new astronomical window into the southern skies has been opened with the high-frequency up-
grade to the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), which allow s radio-interferometric mapping
of sources at wavelengths as short as 3mm. In anticipation of the u pgrade’s completion, a two-day work-
shop was held at the University of Melbourne in November 2001. The w orkshop covered a diverse range
of ﬁelds, tied together by a common theme of identifying key areas w here ATCA observations can have
an impact. More than half of the talks were concerned with molecular clouds and star formation, with
the remainder covering topics such as molecular gas in the Galactic Ce ntre, Seyfert nuclei, and high-
redshift objects. Some early results from the 3mm and 12mm proto type systems were also presented.
In consultation with the speakers, we are presenting in this article a summary of the talks. The original
slides are available from the ATNF website.

1.introduction
Millimetre (mm) astronomy has grown rapidly in the
past decade, spurred by advances in receiver sensitivity
and growing scientiﬁc interest in what might be termed
the “cold universe.” While molecular lines are still the
“bread and butter” of millimetre astronomy, a wide range
of continuum sources can also be studied at these wave-
lengths, and today mm astronomy spans nearly the full
range of astrophysical research, from solar-system studies
to cosmology.
The success of centimetre-wave interferometry, demon-
strated by facilities such as the Westerbork Synthesis Ra-
dio Telescope (WSRT), led to the development of mil-
limetre interferometers in the 1970’s and 1980’s. There
are currently four dedicated mm arrays, all located in the
Northern Hemisphere at latitudes of 35◦to 45◦. A much
larger array, to be built in Chile by an international con-
sortium, will provideamanyfoldincreasein collecting area
over all existing mm arrays put together. This Atacama
LargeMillimeter Array(ALMA) will be completed around
2011. In the meantime, however, another millimetre array
is making its debut in the Southern Hemisphere: the Aus-
tralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), being upgraded
to operate at wavelengths as short as 3mm, is poised to
open a new astronomical window into the southern skies.
In anticipation of the completion of the ATCA upgrade,
a workshop on millimetre-wave science was convened at
the University of Melbourne on 29-30 November 2001.
Participantsfrom the Australianastronomicalcommunity,
as well as guests from overseas, came to discuss and learn
about areas of science that could be addressed with the
new ATCA. As is inevitable with a small meeting, many
areas could not be properly represented—including, but
not limited to, cosmology and VLBI—so this summary
should be considered only a sampling of what might be
possible. We also apologise in advance if, in trying tosummarise the meeting in a cohesive way, we have been
rather selective in our recollections. Slides from the talks
are available for download from the ATNF website3.
2.the atca as a millimetre interferometer
The Australia Telescope Compact Array, situated near
Narrabri, New South Wales (longitude 150◦E, latitude
30◦S) consists of six 22m diameter Cassegrain antennas.
Five of the antennas are transportable along a 3km long
east-west track—now supplemented by a 200m north spur
extending from the centre of the track—andare being out-
ﬁttedwithnew3mm(85-105GHz)and12mm(16-26GHz)
receiver systems. The sixth antenna is ﬁxed at a station
3 km west of the track’s end and will likely be outﬁtted
with a 12mm receiver only. At the time of the meeting,
a 3-element prototype system was available at frequencies
of 85-91 GHz and 16-22 GHz; for the current status of the
upgrade see the online documentation for observers4.
Designed primarily as a cm array, the ATCA suﬀers
from several problems as a mm array: a small primary
beam, few baselines, poor aperture eﬃciency, and a far
from ideal site at an elevation of 200m. In addition, the
present correlator provides a maximum bandwidth of 128
MHz at each of two frequencies, much less than the 1 GHz
or more that is typical at mm wavelengths (see Table 1).
The velocityrangethat canbe achievedbyplacing the two
frequencywindowsside-by-side(allowingforsomeoverlap)
is limited to ∼600 km s−1at 90 GHz. This limitation will
be overcome once a new wideband (2 GHz) FX correla-
tor is installed, as described during the meeting by W.
Wilson. That project, to be undertaken in conjunction
with development for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA),
is due for completion around 2006.
Despite the ATCA’s limitations as a millimetre array,
once the initial stage of the upgrade (ﬁtting complete re-
ceiver systems on 5 antennas) is complete in 2003, it will

possess several unique strengths:
•Enormouscollectingarea,givingitaneﬀectiveaper-
ture (ηAnD2) comparable to that of the Plateau de
Bure interferometer.
•Ability to observe two polarisations simultaneously.
•Wide-bandwidth mixers based on indium phosphide
MMIC technology, which need only be cooled to
about 20 K, as opposed to 4 K for typical SIS junc-
tions.
•A maximum baseline of 3 km, allowing resolution
as ﬁne as 0 .′′2 once radiometric phase correction is
implemented.
As discussed at the meeting by T. Wong , mm inter-
ferometry is much more challenging than cm interferom-
etry, as a result of more stringent technical requirements
(e.g. surface accuracy, pointing, and baseline determina-
tion) and the strongly variable eﬀects of the atmosphere.
In particular, ﬂuctuations in the H 2O vapour layer lead
to ﬂuctuations in atmospheric opacity and observed inter-
ferometric phase that must be monitored with frequent
calibrations. These ﬂuctuations tend to be more severe in
the daytime and in summer, so winter nights are expected
to oﬀer the best observing conditions. As the ﬂuctuations
occur on a range of size scales, longer baselines will suﬀer
from greater atmospheric phase noise under the same ob-
serving conditions. Long-baseline experiments also suﬀer
from a lack of absolute ﬂux calibrators, since the planets,
which are the best primary ﬂux calibrators, are likely to
be resolved out.
The eﬀects of atmospheric phase noise can be largely
undone if the relative H 2O vapour column above each an-
tenna in the direction of the source is known. One way to
determine the water vapour column is to accurately mea-
sure the strength of an H 2O emission line, such as that
at 22.2 GHz. This “water vapour radiometry” technique
was discussed by R. Sault and is currently being tested
at the ATCA, with some encouraging results. The system
observes the 22 GHz line in four channels to better iso-
late line from continuum emission and reduce systematic
errors.
B. Koribalski presentedsomeoftheﬁrstscienceobser-
vations made with the prototype 3mm system, beginningwith “ﬁrst light” in 2000 November. These included ob-
servations of molecular clouds in the Milky Way and LMC
and detection of dense molecular gas in nearby galaxies
like NGC 253 (Figure 1) and Circinus. The highlight thus
far has been the absorption spectrum of Centaurus A in
the HCO+and HNC lines, which provides the ﬁrst ∼1′′
resolution measurement of gas motions in front of the core
ofthisradiogalaxy(Figure2). AsearchforCOabsorption
in the quasar PKS 1921-293 was also conducted.

R. Manchester presented the ﬁrst image of the SN
1987A remnant at 17–19 GHz, made with the 3-element
12mm system in 2001 October. The image, based on a
12-hour synthesis, shows a ∼20 mJy source that is moder-
ately resolved with a synthesised beam of 2 .′′8×1.′′8 (see
Figure 3). A ﬁt of a thin shell to the uvdata gives a diam-
eter of 1.′′5 and a ﬁt of a Gaussian gives a FWHM of 1 .′′1.
An IAU Circular (Manchester & Gaensler 2001) has been
released, and follow-up observations at higher resolution
are planned.Millimetre Science with ATCA 3

3.molecular clouds and star formation
Studies of molecular clouds and star formation within
them occupy a prominent place in millimetre astronomy,
and were the subject of much discussion during the work-
shop. Indeed, as one of the ATCA’s greatest attractions
lies in its southern location, studies of Galactic star forma-tionarepoisedtobeneﬁtimmensely—mostoftheGalaxy’s
nearby star-forming regions (e.g. Chamaeleon, Corona
Australis, Lupus, Ophiuchus), not to mention the Galactic
Centre, are located in the southern sky.
While almost all of the gas in molecular clouds consists
of H2and He, these species do not emit radiation under
conditions typically found in molecular clouds. Except in
rarecaseswhereH 2absorptionagainstaUV sourcecan be
measured, the amount of molecular gas must be inferred
indirectly. A common technique is to observe emission
lines from tracer molecules like CO that have millimetre
orsubmillimetre rotationaltransitions. Not onlycanthese
lines provide information on the distribution and velocity
of the molecular gas, but diﬀerent molecular tracers can
be used to probe diﬀerent density regimes within a cloud.
The ATCA’s ability to study nearbymolecular clouds is
limited by its small ﬁeld of view, lack of sensitivity to
extended structure, and inability to observe the bright
CO(1–0) line at 115 GHz (this last constraint may be
overcome in a future upgrade). Thus, studies of the frag-
mentation of molecular clouds into clumps and cores (cf.
Williams et al. 2000) are best undertaken with other in-
struments. Better suited to the ATCA will be studies of
more distant clouds, such as in the Galactic Centre and
Magellanic Clouds, and studies of dense molecular cores
where star formation is occurring or likely to occur.
3.1.Molecular clouds near the Galactic Centre
Cornelia C. Lang proposed several experiments that
the ATCA can perform to increase our understanding of
theGalacticCentre. Long-termmonitoringofthemillime-4
tre ﬂux from the radio source Sgr A∗, thought to be asso-
ciated with the central black hole, will help to determine
whether the circumnuclear accretion disk is transitory or
stable. Existing NH 3, HCN, and HCO+images of the
circumnuclear disk, taken with the VLA and BIMA inter-
ferometers, show ﬁlamentary streamers of molecular gas
falling onto the disk, providing direct evidence of inward
gas transport (McGary et al. 2001; Wright et al. 2001).
However, they are inconclusive on the issue of disk stabil-
ity.
Single-dish mapping of molecular gas in the vicinity of
the Galactic Centre RadioArc hasrevealedthat it is phys-
ically related to the ionised gas in this region as well as
to the radio non-thermal ﬁlaments (NTFs). Recently, in-
terferometric studies made with OVRO reveal a complex
geometrical arrangement and kinematic structure in the
molecular gas (Lang, Goss & Morris 2002, submitted).
The associations between the ionised and molecular gas
suggest that the action of energetic winds from young stel-
lar clusters (such as the Arches cluster) plays an impor-
tant role in this region. The NTFs are thought to trace
a large-scale, poloidal ﬁeld normal to the Galactic plane
in the inner 250 pc of the Galaxy. The interfaces between
the NTFs and molecular clouds may be sites where twist-
ing and reversal of magnetic ﬁeld lines occurs, followed by
magnetic reconnection which accelerates the electrons to
relativistic speeds (e.g., Serabyn & Morris 1994). With its
superior view of the Galactic Centre, high spectral resolu-
tion, and dual polarisation capability, the ATCA can help
elucidate these processes.
Millimetre images of the Galactic Centre can be com-
pared with the recent Chandra Galactic Center Survey
(Wang et al. 2002), which covers the central 300 ×100 pc
with a resolution( ∼1′′) that is well matched to the ATCA.
Such multiwavelength studies will help to resolve puzzles
like the origin of the diﬀuse Fe line emission at 6.4 keV
from the G.C. molecular clouds: is this ﬂuorescent line ex-
cited by an energetic outburst from Sgr A∗(Koyama et al.
1996), or from a more local source of X-rays responsible
for driving the expanding molecular shells in the region
(Mart´ ın-Pintado et al. 1999)?
3.2.Shocked molecular gas
The structure and chemical composition of a shock in
the ISM arecontrolledby the shockspeed vs. In J-type, or
‘fast’, shocks, which occur for vs/greaterorsimilar40kms−1, molecular
gasisdissociatedandionisedtoasubstantialdegreeimme-
diately upstreamand downstreamfrom the shock, both by
collisionsandbyUVradiationproducedattheshockfront.
It is only far downstream from the shock, where the gas
coolsto≈500K,thatmoleculereformationoccurs. J-type
shocks are ineﬃcient emitters of infrared line radiation,
but strong emitters of far-infrared continuum (because the
UV ﬂux is reprocessed by grains). On the other hand, in
C-type, or ‘slow’, shocks, which occur for vs/lessorsimilar40kms−1,
the shock front is broadened by ambipolar diﬀusion, and
molecules are not dissociated to the same extent. The en-
ergy radiated by such shocks appears mainly in infrared
lines (atomic and ionic ﬁne-structure lines and molecular
rotation-vibration transitions). Since the molecules are
not destroyed, they can reach much higher temperatures
than in J-type shocks (Kaufman & Neufeld 1996), drivingendothermic reactions and hence interesting chemistry.
An important consequence of C-shocks discussed by M.
Wardle at the meeting is the eﬃcient production of H 2O
from atomic oxygen (O →OH→H2O). This can give rise
to intense water maser emission at 22 GHz and at submil-
limetre wavelengths (Kaufman & Neufeld 1996). Within
supernova remnants (SNRs), a strong X-ray ﬂux releases
high-energy electrons which can excite the Lyman and
WernerbandsofH 2. Theresultingfar-UVﬂuxcandissoci-
ate some of the H 2O back into OH (Wardle 1999), thereby
accounting for the strong OH maser activity at 1720 MHz
associated with SNRs (Frail et al. 1994). The associations
between shocked H 2and OH masers in the SNRs G359.1-
0.5(Lazendicet al. 2002)andG349.7+0.2(Lazendic et al.,
in preparation) are consistent with this picture, but direct
observations of H 2O, using the ATCA at 22 GHz, would
be valuable.
Wardle also suggested a number of lines in the 3mm
band which could be used to probe shock regions. Good
targets are the interaction regions between a supernova
remnant and a cloud; many are distant, so a 30′′ﬁeld of
view is acceptable. If X-ray induced dissociation of water
is indeed occurring, one would also expect the SO 2/SO ra-
tio tobe aﬀected, sinceSO 2is moreeasilydissociatedthan
SO. This could be tested by observations of the SO(3 2–21)
transition at 99.3 GHz and the SO 2(313–202) transition at
104 GHz. With the existing prototype system, the ATCA
can already image the shock-tracing SiO(2–1) line at 86
GHz. The presence of SiO in the gas phase is an indica-
tion of grain sputtering (Schilke et al. 1997).
3.3.Identifying molecular cores
As reviewed by T. Bourke , molecular cores have typ-
ical masses of 1–10 M ⊙and sizes of 0.1–0.5 pc. They
therefore occupy a small fraction of the mass and an even
smaller fraction of the volume of an entire cloud. Since
cores with embedded young stellar objects (YSO’s) will
be heated, they can be detected in wide-ﬁeld maps of
molecular clouds in infrared or submillimetre dust emis-
sion. Such maps will be provided by focal plane arrays on
single-dish telescopes, such as the SEST Imaging Bolome-
ter Array (SIMBA), and by an upcoming Legacy project
on the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). With
its high resolution and sensitivity, the ATCA will be im-
portant for detailed studies of the cores identiﬁed by such
surveys.
Starlesscores, which by deﬁnition are not (yet) infrared
sources, are probably best identiﬁed using line emission
from dense gas tracers such as NH 3(23 GHz), CS (98
GHz), and N 2H+(93 GHz). The system of NH 3lines
is also useful for determining densities and temperatures
within cores. Temperature diagnostics are essential be-
cause observed linewidths may be dominated by turbulent
motions.
While nearby clouds like Taurus are important labo-
ratories for studying low-mass star formation, identifying
sites where massive(>10 M⊙) star formation is occurring
is considerably more diﬃcult, due to the rapid evolution-
ary timescales for massive stars, their tendency to form
in clusters where source confusion is a problem, and their
relative scarcity (hence, they tend to be observed at larger
distances). The basic technique, as outlined by Bourke, isMillimetre Science with ATCA 5
to search for cores with dense gas (as traced by CS emis-
sion) and hot dust (as traced by IRAS far-infrared ﬂuxes)
where the massive protostar has not yet ionised its sur-
roundings (i.e., no detectable 5 GHz emission from an H II
region). A useful starting point would be the catalogue by
Bronfman et al. (1986).
Masers are another important signpost for massive star
formation, as pointed out by V. Minier . Class II
methanol masers, especially the lines at 6.7 and 12.2 GHz,
appear to be strongly correlated with the earlystages of
massive star formation, namely outﬂows and hot molecu-
lar cores, but maser activity apparently peaks before the
emergence of an ultracompact H IIregion (Minier et al.
2001).
3.4.From dense cores to protostellar disks
The formation of protostellar disks is still poorly un-
derstood. Schematically, it appears that dense cores form
within molecular clouds (perhaps at the intersections of
ﬁlamentary structure) and then collapse gravitationally to
form rotationally supported disks. Yet the dynamical pro-
cesses and timescales involved in disk formation are still
quite uncertain. A useful idealised model (neglecting rota-
tionandmagneticﬁelds)isthe“inside-out”collapsemodel
of Shu (1977), which represents the collapse of a singular
isothermal sphere. This model predicts power-law density
and velocity proﬁles of n(r)∝r−1.5andv(r)∝r−0.5in
the inner, collapsing regions (see Evans 1999).
M. Hunt described how millimetre spectroscopy can
be used to determine chemical abundances and physical
conditions in molecular cloud cores. She presented the
results of single-dish studies of southern molecular clouds
withMopraandSEST.Ofparticularinterestaremolecules
that can be observed at several optically thin transitions,
so that a “rotation diagram” (Goldsmith & Langer 1999)
can be used to infer the kinetic temperature, under the as-
sumption that the level populations are in local thermody-
namic equilibrium (LTE). Corrections for departures from
LTE can be made using the large velocity gradient (LVG)
approximation. Among the potential tracers for ATCA
studies are CH 3OH (at least 7 thermal transitions from
86–115 GHz), HC 3N (3 transitions), and OCS (3 transi-
tions). The ATCA will be able to perform these studies at
much higher resolution, reducing the uncertainties associ-
ated with averaging over a ﬁnite beam.
T. Bourke reviewedthe rapidly growingliterature con-
cerned with spectroscopic infall signatures in dense cores.
The most common signature, observed in optically thick
lines like HCO+, is an asymmetric line proﬁle skewed to-
wards the blue, since the red side of the line is formed
at larger (hence cooler) radii from the central source than
the blue side (see explanation in Evans 1999). In addition,
the presence of a cold, static envelope outside the collapse
region leads to a self-absorption feature near the systemic
velocity. Examples of line proﬁles that match these pre-
dictions are given in studies by Gregersen et al. (1997) of
embedded YSO’s and Lee et al. (1999) of starless cores.
These authors also show that blue-skewed proﬁles are not
seen in optically thin tracers like N 2H+or H13CO+, in
agreement with infall models.
While most ofthese observationsweremade with single-
dish telescopes, high-resolution data are important in thatthey allow better discrimination between the diﬀerent ef-
fects (infall, rotation, outﬂow, and turbulence) which can
be superposed in a single-dish beam. Indeed, the best-
known candidate for a collapsing protostar, in the isolated
globule B335 (Zhou et al. 1993; Choi et al. 1995) looks
less clear-cut when viewed at higher resolution (Wilner
et al. 2000). This raises the question of whether single-
dish data alone can suﬃciently constrain the range of pos-
sible models. To date, the most convincing evidence for
infall motions—line proﬁles with the “inverse P Cygni”
shape (blueshifted emission with redshifted absorption)—
has been gathered with interferometers (e.g., Di Francesco
et al. 2001), where the beam is suﬃciently small to see the
infalling gas in absorption.
G. Blake pointed out that high angular resolution is
also needed to study the transition from the embedded
phase, where most of the gas is in an infalling envelope, to
the T Tauri phase, where most of the gas is in a rotating
disk, as the angular size scales involved are ∼1000 AU, or
7′′at the distance of Taurus. This transition appears to
occur quite rapidly, given the apparent paucity of tran-
sitional forms (one example is proposed by Hogerheijde
2001). Disk envelopes can be traced via the HCO+and
HCN lines, both of which are accessible with the ATCA
prototype system, while the disk itself should be trace-
able in continuum emission, especially once the wideband
correlator is available.
3.5.Modelling disk evolution
As reviewed by S. Maddison at this meeting, simula-
tions are an important tool for understanding the evolu-
tion of protostellar disks. Massive disks are susceptible to
gravitational instabilities, which can induce mass accre-
tion and hence feed back on the gravitational potential.
These eﬀects are diﬃcult to model analytically but are
well-suited for N-body simulations. An important obser-
vationalinputisthemasssurfacedensityofthedisk,which
can be crudely estimated from the mass and radius. In the
early stages of accretion, when the disk is massive, gravi-
tational instabilities dominate and can lead to spiral arm
formation or disk fragmentation—which can in turn lead
to binary or giant planet formation. In later stages, most
of the mass has accreted to the centre, the disk rotation
is nearly Keplerian, and accretion is driven by turbulent
viscosity.
A nice example of concordance between theory and
observation occurs in the case of circumbinary disks.
Subarcsecond-resolution observations of GG Tau (Guil-
loteau et al. 1999) show a central hole in the dust dis-
tribution, consistent with the gap that should be cleared
by resonant torques in a binary system. Observations at
still higher resolution, however, will be needed to test the
more detailed predictions of the simulations, such as the
formation of bisymmetric spiral structure and accretion
streams feeding the stars.
3.6.Disks around pre-main-sequence stars
G. Blake reviewed observations of protoplanetary
disks, such as those associated with T Tauri stars. With
radii of order 100 AU (1′′at the distance of Taurus), sub-
arcsecond resolution will be needed to study such disks.
Such resolution has recently been achieved by other mm6
arrays (e.g., Simon et al. 2001, using the IRAM Plateau
de Bure), and should be achievable by the ATCA once the
radiometric phase correction system is operational. Even
with a small number of baselines and relatively incom-
plete coverage of the visibility plane, the basic structure
of disks can be investigated by modelling the visibilities
directly (e.g., Guilloteau & Dutrey 1998).
Molecular lines can be a valuable probe of disk kine-
matics, but the large ranges in density and temperature
around YSO accretion disks lead to a complex chemistry
which is vital to understand. An important phenomenon
is the depletion of molecules onto dust grains that occurs
primarily at high densities and low temperatures but can
be reversed by irradiation and shocks. The commonly em-
ployed molecular tracer CO, for instance, may be depleted
even when H 2remains in the gas phase. Such “freeze-out”
is especially likely near the disk midplane, where densi-
ties are highest. Where CO is detectable, it is likely to
be optically thick and trace only the disk’s outer layers;
observing rarer CO isotopes, such as13CO (110.2 GHz)
and C18O (109.8 GHz), will be crucial for probing the
vertical structure of disks. This will be a key focus for
future high-resolution studies, and a strong argument for
110 GHz capability at the ATCA.
Another way to trace the disk kinematics is via maser
emission. The relative fringe phase between maser spots
is insensitive to baseline errors and atmospheric eﬀects
(Wright & Plambeck 1983), and can be used to deduce
their relative positions to hundredths of an arcsecond if
the spots are separated in velocity (e.g., Plambeck et al.
1990). In addition, once the instrumental baseline has
been determined by observing quasars across a wide range
of hour angles and declinations, absolute position informa-
tion is also available (e.g., Forster et al. 1978).
For deducing physical quantities such as density, tem-
perature, and chemical composition, observations of mul-
tiple lines, including (for density and temperature) transi-
tions between diﬀerent energy levels of the same molecule,
are necessary. Because of the ATCA’s limited frequency
range, many of the commonly used molecular tracers will
only be observable in a single transition (generally the
J= 1→0 line). Nonetheless, an interferometer map
may still provide useful constraints on source geometry to
complement single-dish measurements. Examples of stud-
ies that have exploited this method include Dutrey et al.
(1997) and Hogerheijde et al. (1997). Infrared spectra can
also provide complementary information on physical con-
ditions, with the advantage that many lines can be ob-
served simultaneously in a given spectrum (see e.g. the
review by van Dishoeck & Blake 1998).
3.7.Bipolar Outﬂows
Outﬂows from star-forming cores are ubiquitous, as
pointed out by T. Bourke , but are often so embedded
in dust that they can only be studied in the radio. Fine
velocity resolution is critical, as the outﬂow speeds can be
as little as a few km s−1. Spatial resolution is essential as
well, especially in crowded regions where identifying the
source of the outﬂow can be problematic. Some of the ob-
vious southern targets are regions around ρOphiuchi, R
Coronae Australis, and Circinus.
While CO is the usual tracer because of its high abun-dance and low critical density, other molecular lines (e.g.
from CS or NH 3) can provide additional information. Of
particular importance for the ATCA in the near term is
the thermal SiO line at 86.8 GHz, which falls within one
of the frequency windows available to the 3-element pro-
totype system. The SiO molecules are liberated from dust
grains shocked by the outﬂow, and thus trace the outﬂow
more directly than a general gas tracer like CO. The pres-
ence of an outﬂow is often indicated in single-dish spectra
by broad line wings at relative velocities of up to ∼60
km s−1.
Although the origin of bipolar outﬂows remains contro-
versial (see reviews by Shu et al. 2000; K¨ onigl & Pudritz
2000), there is little doubt that magnetic ﬁelds play an im-
portant role in accelerating and collimating the observed
jets. Magnetic ﬁelds in dense molecular regions are usu-
ally revealed by the linear polarisationof thermal emission
fromspinningdust grains. In regionswherethecontinuum
is weak, it is still possible to detect polarisation in molec-
ular line transitions due to the Goldreich-Kylaﬁs (Goldre-
ich & Kylaﬁs 1981) eﬀect, although this eﬀect is rarely
observed. For recent detections see Greaves et al. (1999)
and Girart et al. (1999). With its exceptional sensitivity
and dual polarisation capability, the ATCA should be in
a good position to exploit this technique.
R. G. Smith stressed the importance of complemen-
tary infrared observations. IR absorption spectra are sen-
sitive to the presence of ices, since the same molecule
produces diﬀerent absorption proﬁles in the gas vs. solid
phase. Optical and near-infrared polarimetry can be used
to reveal light that has been scattered by a disk. These
techniques were illustrated in the case of OH231.8+4.2,
an evolved star in which numerous molecular lines have
been observed(Morriset al. 1987;S´ anchez Contreraset al.
2000). Of particular interest among these is HCO+, which
appears to be enhanced in the lobes of the outﬂow, per-
haps due to shock-induced reactions.
3.8.Debris Disks
Late in their evolution, protostellardisks have dispersed
most of their gas and a debris disk remains, with a mass
only a few percent of the central star. Observations
of such disks (and their immediate precursors, the disks
around T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars) were reviewed
byChris Wright . Debris disks were ﬁrst identiﬁed as ex-
cess far-infrared emission around main sequence stars like
Vega (αLyrae) and βPictoris. Ground-based (and more
recently HST) imaging and spectroscopy revealed dusty
disks around these stars, sometimes with warps and gaps
indicative of planetary perturbers.
A primary motivation for studying these systems is to
determine the timescale for disk dispersal, which is impor-
tant for constraining theories of planet formation. This
is best done by comparing the dust emission from disks
in various stages of evolution (e.g., Holland et al. 1998).
Although inferring dust masses from millimetre or submil-
limetre continuum emission is hardly straightforward, one
cangetahandleonthe grainpropertiesusingmid-infrared
spectroscopy of the 10 µm and 20 µm silicate features.
Studying the disk rotation and gas-phase chemistry re-
quires molecular line observations. However, searches at
millimetre wavelengths for gas in debris disks have gener-Millimetre Science with ATCA 7
ally been unsuccessful (e.g., Liseau & Artymowicz 1998).
Direct observations of H 2with the Infrared Space Obser-
vatory (ISO) indicate that there is indeed molecular gas
present (Thi et al. 2001), so CO must be strongly depleted
(by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude) compared to typical re-
gions of molecular clouds. The reason for this depletion
could be a combination of photodissociation and freeze-
out onto grains. In addition, at temperatures above 20 K,
theJ= 2 and higher levels of CO are preferentially pop-
ulated compared to J= 1, and the CO(1–0) line is thus
relatively weak (Liseau & Artymowicz 1998). Indeed, the
disk around the nearby T Tauri star TW Hya has been de-
tected more strongly in the higher Jtransitions (Kastner
et al. 1997), with no CO(1–0) detected at Mopra (upper
limit∼0.3 K in a 30′′beam). These results suggest that
heating of the disk is rather eﬃcient, probably due to ﬂar-
ing of the outer parts of the disk (cf. HST observations by
Burrows et al. 1996).
4.interstellar and circumstellar masers
4.1.Methanol masers
Methanol (CH 3OH) masers are generally found in ac-
tive star-forming regions, and have traditionally been di-
vided into two empirical classes. Class I masers are
well-separated from compact continuum sources and OH
masers. Class II sources are generally associated with ul-
tracompact H II(UCHII) regions, although this associ-
ation has become less convincing with higher resolution
data. Nonetheless, since certain maser lines are only seen
in Class I sources and the rest only in Class II sources,
the distinction between the two classes appears to have a
physical basis. Methanol maser lines have been detected
at numerous frequencies from 6.7 to 157 GHz, with the
brightest lines being the Class II transitions at 6.7 and
12.2 GHz. The maser “spots” themselves have sizes of or-
der 1 milliarcsecond, although they are typically found in
clusters of up to an arcsecond in size.
V. Minier reviewedobservationsofthespatialdistribu-
tion of masers, many of them conducted at milliarcsecond
resolutionwith VLBI. Interestingly, it appearsthat the 6.7
and 12.2 GHz masers are often oﬀset from their nearest
UCHII regions by several arcseconds (Walsh et al. 1998;
Minier et al. 2001). In these cases, they appear to coincide
instead with hot molecular cores (HMCs) seen in NH 3and
CH3CN. A possible evolutionary scenario was presented,
in which methanol masers form in the protostellar (HMC)
phase, the young star begins to ionise its surroundingsand
destroy the masers, and ﬁnally an UCHII region emerges
without maser activity. Testing this scenario requires re-
solving individual protostars using high-resolution instru-
ments, inferring their masses from continuum ﬂuxes, and
inferring their ages by comparing observed spectral line
ratios with chemical models (e.g., Rodgers & Charnley
2001). Much of this work should be possible with the
ATCA.
A. Sobolev discussed how physical conditions can be
inferred from observations of molecular masers and ther-
mal lines. Besides CH 3OH, a number of other maser tran-
sitions can be studied, including H 2O, OH, SiO, and NH 3.
Among the transitions of particular interest for the ATCA
upgrade is the 95.2 GHz Class I methanol maser. A south-
ern survey of these masers was recently conducted withthe Mopra telescope by Val’tts et al. (2000). The spectra
of methanol masers often show multiple, independently
varying components that are generally attributed to mo-
tions within the molecular cloud, and can thus be used
to probe the turbulent velocity spectrum. For example,
the positions and spectra of masers near 25 GHz detected
in the Orion Molecular Cloud (Johnston et al. 1992) can
be modeled in terms of Kolmogorov-like turbulence, al-
though the spectrum appears to fall more steeply with
wavenumber than the standard Kolmogorov law (Sobolev
et al. 1998). Meanwhile, thermal lines, such as CS(2–1) at
96.4 GHz, SiO(2–1) at 86.8 GHz, and CH 3OH (2 K–1K)
at 96.7 GHz, provide useful information about tempera-
ture, density, and shock chemistry, while high-resolution
(interferometric) mapping can be used to study jets and
shocks.
A more detailed look at the excitation of Class II
methanol masers was provided by D. Cragg . Although
the formation of inverted populations (“pumping”) that
can lead to masing remains an area of ongoing investiga-
tion, Class II transitions are thought to be pumped radia-
tivelybyinfraredphotonsfromthewarmdustsurrounding
young massive stars. While the IR photons produce the
population inversion, bright masers are the result of high
methanol abundance, together with beaming and/or am-
pliﬁcation of the UCHII background continuum. Sobolev
& Deguchi (1994) and Sobolev et al. (1997b) have mod-
eled these processes in detail to reproduce the high ob-
served brightness temperatures of the 6.7 and 12.2 GHz
masers. Strong masing is found to occur for dust temper-
aturesTd>150 K, gas densities 106< nH[cm−3]<108,
and methanol abundances relative to H 2of>10−7. The
models also predict Class II masers at 81.0, 85.6, 86.6,
86.9, 94.5, 108.9, and 111.2 GHz (Sobolev et al. 1997a), in
addition to the relatively strong line at 107.0 GHz, which
has already been detected in over 25 sources (Val’tts et al.
1999; Caswell et al. 2000). Observational progress in de-
tecting new maser transitions has been rapid, with recent
detections of the 86.6 and 86.9 GHz masers in the proto-
typical Class II source W3(OH) reported by Sutton et al.
(2001) using BIMA, and of the 85.6, 86.6, and 86.9 GHz
masers in the rich southern source G345.01+1.79reported
by Cragg et al. (2001) using SEST and Mopra.
4.2.Late-type variable stars
Molecular masers are also observed around late-type
variable stars such as Miras, which are characterised by
pulsation periods in the range of ∼100 to∼500 days,
strong molecular bands in their optical spectra (TiO and
VOfortypeM,ZrOfortypeS,CNandC 2fortypeC),and
bright Balmer emission lines. The Balmer lines are pro-
duced by strong atmospheric shocks driven by the stellar
pulsations; the outgoing, spherical pressure wave steep-
ens to form a shock as it propagates into a decreasing
density gradient. Mass loss at a rate of up to 10−5M⊙
yr−1creates a circumstellar envelope which hosts masers
such as OH, H 2O, SiO, and HCN. The SiO and HCN
masersarebelievedtoariseclosetothestellarphotosphere
(R∼1014cm), whereas the H 2O masers are associated
with the expanding shell at distances R∼1014–1016cm,
and OH masers with the outer parts of the shell at dis-
tancesR/greaterorsimilar1016cm.8
The light curves of late-type variables vary with wave-
length, as discussed by G. Rudnitskij . For example, the
near-infrared maxima lag behind the optical maxima by
about 0.1 P, where Pis the period (Lockwood & Wing
1971). The H 2O maser ﬂux also appears to lag behind the
optical ﬂux, by about 0.05–0.35 Pin RS Virginis (Lekht
et al. 2001). Such a large phase lag appears to rule out ra-
diative pumping; instead, it is proposed that the arrival of
a periodic shock into the masing region leads to enhanced
collisional pumping of the maser (Rudnitskij & Chuprikov
1990). Consistent with this hypothesis is the presence of
a peak in the cross-correlation function at a lag of 3–5 P
(whereP≈1 yr), roughly the time for a shock to travel
from the stellar surface to the region where masers can
form (R≈1014cm). Shock pumping is also suggested
for the H 2O maser ﬂare in R Leo that was observed ∼18
months after an H αﬂare (Esipov et al. 1999). Although
the H2O and SiO maser spots are expected to be unre-
solved by the ATCA, it was noted that if they are suﬃ-
ciently bright and appear at distinct velocities, then their
relativepositionscanbedeterminedtoafractionofabeam
(Plambeck et al. 1990; see §3.6).
Rudnitskij closed his presentation with the provocative
suggestion that H αﬂares may be due to a Jovian-sized
planet in an eccentric orbit at a few AU, which has sur-
vived the red giant phase and excites strong atmospheric
shocks during each periastron passage. If the stellar mass
loss is asymmetric, a highly eccentric planetary orbit can
be maintained against the circularising action of viscous
torques.
5.interstellar medium in galaxies
S. Curran noted that the ATCA is well suited
to mapping the spatial distribution of molecular gas
within Seyfert galaxies. Notably, the two nearest star-
burst/Seyfert hybrids, NGC 4945 and Circinus, are only
observable with southern telescopes. An important obser-
vation would be to demonstrate the ability of a dusty cir-
cumnucleartorustocollimateamolecularoutﬂow: Curran
et al. (1999) argued for the existence of such an outﬂow
in Circinus based on SEST mapping, but higher resolu-
tionobservationsareneededtoconﬁrmitsassociationwith
the observed ionisation cone (Veilleux & Bland-Hawthorn
1997, and references therein).
Another unresolved issue centres on the question of how
well the dense gas tracer HCN correlates with star for-
mation. NGC 4945 shows a higher HCN/CO ratio, and
a higher HCN/FIR (far-infrared) ratio, than Circinus de-
spite lower gas densities ( ∼104vs. 105cm−3) (Curran
et al. 2001). In light of BIMA maps of the Seyfert galaxy
NGC 1068 which show that most of the HCN is concen-
trated towards the centre, whereas CO and star formation
are located in a ring ∼1 kpc in radius (Helfer & Blitz
1995), this suggests that much of the HCN emission in
NGC 4945 comes from more diﬀuse gas associated with
the dusty torus in the inner ∼10 pc, whereas in Circinus it
is associatedwithstar-formingcoresinthe ∼500-pc-radius
molecular ring. However, better angular resolution will be
needed to test this hypothesis.
M. Dopita discussed the implications of recent theo-
retical work on the predicted spectrum of dust emission
at millimetre wavelengths. First of all, while the dustabsorption coeﬃcient κis usually assumed to scale as
κ∝ν0.7at low frequencies, implying a steeply declining
emission spectrum with wavelength, laboratory measure-
ments by Mennella et al. (1998)indicate that κ(and hence
the emissivity) is strongly temperature-dependent, so that
hot dust would show excess emission at long (millimetre)
wavelengths. This could be an important consideration
forinterpretingmm/sub-mmcontinuum ﬂuxesfromgalac-
tic nuclei. Secondly, electric dipole radiation from small
(∼100 atoms) aspherical, rotating grains is predicted to
peak at a rest frequency near 30GHz (Draine & Lazar-
ian 1998). This prediction follows from a consideration of
several eﬀects including “plasma drag” (the interaction of
the grain’s dipole moment with passing ions) and “electro-
staticfocussing”(the changeinthecollisionalcrosssection
due to electrostatic attraction or repulsion), and may ex-
plain the excess background emission near this frequency
observed by Leitch et al. (1997) and others. Finally, mag-
netic dipole radiation can be emitted by dust containing
ferromagnetic materials (Draine & Lazarian 1999), with
emission peaking in the tens of GHz (depending on the
characteristic gyrofrequency).
6.high-redshift molecular gas
T. Wiklind reviewed the observability of molecular gas
at high redshift. Studies of emission and absorption are
complementary, with emission lines providing global prop-
erties (gas content and rotational velocity) whereas ab-
sorption lines probe the gas on much smaller scales and
with much greater sensitivity. Although the number of
detections to date is small, the fact that the CO line has
already been observed out to z∼5 has allayed concerns
that low metallicities would render it undetectable. On
the other hand, there is little doubt that metallicity does
aﬀect the LCO/MH2ratio (e.g., Maloney & Black 1988),
so the objects detected (especially in emission) are likely
to be unusually luminous and dusty. Moreover, optimistic
early assessments of the detectability of CO at z >5 (Silk
& Spaans 1997) have been questioned by more recent sim-
ulations (Combes et al. 1999).
As of 2001 November, thirteen CO emission sources had
been detected at z >1 (all with interferometers, which
provide the necessary gain stability for long integrations);
more than half of the detected sources appear to be gravi-
tationally lensed. The highest redshift source is at z=4.69
(Omont et al. 1996). Note that because of the increased
cosmicmicrowavebackground(CMB) temperatureathigh
redshift, higher Jtransitions of CO can be as bright or
even brighter than the J=1→0 transition. Thus, high-
redshift sources can still be detected in the 3mm band, as
highJtransitions are redshifted into this band. Figure 4
showstheredshiftcoverageoftheATCAsystem, assuming
its frequency range can be extended to 115 GHz.
Absorption lines can be detected out to any redshift as
long as a suitably bright continuum source is available.
For instance, one can achieve comparable signal-to-noise
on thez >0.89 quasar PKS 1830-211(Wiklind & Combes
1996) as on a nearby galaxy like Cen A. The integrated
opacity can be approximated as/integraldisplay

whereNtotis the total column density of the molecule,Millimetre Science with ATCA 9
Txis the excitation temperature given by the level pop-
ulations, and µ0is the permanent dipole moment. This
expression shows that absorption is particularly sensitive
to cold gas, and that a molecule with a high dipole mo-
ment like HCO+can be as strong as CO in absorption,
despite lower abundance. Including the HCO+series of
lines allows for even more complete redshift coverage in
the 3mm band (Figure 4).
With its excellent sensitivity, the ATCA should be a
superb tool for detecting molecules in high-redshift galax-
ies. Potential emission targets are best identiﬁed at sub-
millimetre wavelengths (e.g., Frayer et al. 1998), where
the strongly increasing dust emission with frequency oﬀ-
sets the dimming due to increased cosmological distance
(Hughes 1996). The SCUBA and SIMBA instruments on
the James Clerk Maxwell Telecope (JCMT) and the SEST
respectively are being utilised for such searches. Red-
shifts can be determined by several techniques, listed here
in order of decreasing accuracy: (1) optical spectroscopy
(e.g., Ivison et al. 1998), (2) multi-colour optical pho-
tometry (e.g., Mobasher et al. 1996), or (3) the radio-to-
submillimetre spectral index (Carilli & Yun 1999). While
optical redshifts (methods 1 and 2) are more accurate,
Smail et al. (2000) have concluded that most of the
SCUBA-detected sources are at z/greaterorsimilar2 and do not have
optical identiﬁcations. The third method, based on the
assumption that the observed correlation between radio
and far-infraredemissionin star-forminggalaxies(Condon
1992) is valid at high redshift, requires only ﬂux measure-
ments at 1.4 and 350 GHz.
Potential absorption targets can be selected from cata-
loguesofradio-loud(especially millimetre-loud)QSO’s. In
principle, optical and/or near-infrared colors can be usedto select quasars which are reddened by dust (Webster
et al. 1995), as would be expected if there wereintervening
molecular gas. On the other hand, as noted by R. Web-
sterandM. Drinkwater at the meeting, synchrotron
emission may account for the reddened spectra in a large
fractionofcases(Francisetal.2001),highlightingtheneed
for more reﬁned selection criteria. Yet another problem is
choosing the observing frequency in the absence of a reli-
able optical redshift (for either the background source or
the absorber). Lacking redshift information, it should still
be possible to scan across the 3mm band in a reasonable
amount of time (e.g., Wiklind & Combes 1996), particu-
larly once the ATCA’s bandwidth has been upgraded.
An increased sample of molecular gas detections at
high redshift would beneﬁt a variety of studies. By pro-
viding accurate redshifts for submillimetre sources, they
would signiﬁcantly improve our knowledge of the evolu-
tion of massive galaxies and of the star formation rate.
In addition, by observing multiple transitions of the same
molecule and deriving the excitation temperature, one can
place upper limits on the CMB temperature as a function
of redshift.
As discussed by M. Murphy andM. Drinkwater in
the ﬁnal talk of the workshop, high signal-to-noise CO
and HIspectra of absorption-line systems can be used
to provide constraints on variations in the ﬁne-structure
constant ( α=e2//planckover2pi1c) with redshift. Speciﬁcally, the ratio
of the H Ihyperﬁne to the CO rotational line frequency is
proportional to y=α2gp, wheregpis the proton g-factor
(Murphy et al. 2001a). A recent analysis by Murphy et al.
(2001a)leads to an upper limit of ∆ α/α <3×10−6at red-
shifts of 0.25 and 0.68, assuming a constant gp. However,
higher redshift systems are needed to test claims, based
Fig. 4.— Observability of the CO and HCO+lines at high redshift with a frequency coverage from 85–115 GHz. For each transition there
is a redshift range (given by a horizontal bar) where the line falls within the observable band. Adapted from a ﬁgure by T. W iklind.10
on optical QSO spectra, that ∆ α/αdeviates signiﬁcantly
from 0 at z >1 (Webb et al. 1999; Murphy et al. 2001b).
