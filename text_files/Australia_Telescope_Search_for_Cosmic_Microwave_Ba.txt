ABSTRACT
In an attempt to detect cosmic microwave background (CMB) aniso tropy on arcmin
scales, we have made an 8.7-GHz image of a sky region with a resolution of two arcmin
and high surface brightness sensitivity using the Australia Telescop e Compact Array
(ATCA) in an ultra-compact conﬁguration. The foreground discre te-source confusion
was estimated from observations with higher resolution at the same frequency and
in a scaled array at a lower frequency. Following the subtraction of t he foreground
confusion, the ﬁeld shows no features in excess of the instrument noise. This limits
the CMB anisotropy ﬂat-band power to Qflat<23.6µK with 95 per cent conﬁdence;
the ATCA ﬁlter function∗Flin multipole l-space peaks at leff= 4700 and has half
maximum values at l= 3350 and 6050.
Key words: cosmic microwave background – cosmology: observations – techniq ues:

whereQflatdenotes the quadrupole normalization of a ﬂat
CMB anisotropy spectrum. The observing scheme and data
analysis procedures determine the window function Flfor
any experiment. The implications of any observed CMB
temperature variance (∆ T)2may be quoted in fairly model
independent terms by the inferred Qflat. ThisQflatmay be
viewed as being a measure of the CMB anisotropy power
spectral density within the l-space window deﬁned by Fl.
Recent observations of the anisotropy in the CMB on
large and intermediate angular scales ( l<∼500) have begun
to provide interesting constraints on theories of structur e
formation and the parameters of cosmological models (see,
for example, Lineweaver and Barbosa (1997) for an updated
∗The ATCA ﬁlter function is available at the website
www.atnf.csiro.au/research/cmbr/cmbr atca.htmlcompilation of data points and a discussion of their impli-
cations).
Primary CMB anisotropies at small angular scales ( l>∼
500) are expected to be relatively damped in most struc-
ture formation models owing to the the thickness of the last
scattering surface and the diﬀusion damping of sub-horizon
scale baryon ﬂuctuations in the pre-recombination epoch.
However, ﬂat-bandpowers comparable to the Qflatdetected
byCOBE DMR (Bennett et al. 1996) may be predicted at
multipoles l>∼500 in certain cosmological-constant (Λ) and
open-universe manifestations of baryon isocurvature mod-
els (Hu & Sugiyama 1994; Hu, Bunn & Sugiyama 1995).
The anisotropy power at large lmay be critically dependent
on the reionization history: small-scale anisotropies may be
suppressed by early reionization.
Secondary anisotropies may be generated at the later
last-scattering-surface in a reionized universe predomin antly
owing to second-order mode coupling between density per-
turbations and bulk velocities (the ‘Vishniac eﬀect’); thi s
could signiﬁcantly contribute to arcmin-scale ( l>∼103)
anisotropies particularly if the ionization fraction is hi gh at
late times (Hu, Scott & Silk 1994). Persi et al. (1995) esti-
mate that this second-order Doppler eﬀect may contribute a
bandpower Qflat≈0.2µKatl≈103inCDM and CDM+Λ
universes and that the anisotropy power may be an order of
magnitude higher in certain baryon isocurvature models.
Jones et al. (1997) report the detection of a ∼100µK
negative feature in a 2-arcmin resolution image of a sky
patch that has no obvious cluster of galaxies along the line
of sight in either optical or ROSAT X-ray images. A sen-
sitive low-resolution image of a ‘blank’ ﬁeld with the VLA

(Richardset al. 1997) is also reportedtoshow anegative fea -
ture approximately 25′′×65′′in size and with a peak central
decrementof −250µK. It has beensuggested thatthese may
be CMB decrements owing to the inverse-Compton scatter-
ing of CMB photons, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (S-Z) eﬀect, in
distant concentrations of hot gas. It may be noted that Hat-
tori et al. (1997) recently reported the discovery, in its X- ray
emission, ofahotgasconcentrationataredshift z≈1whose
properties are similar to the gaseous halos in rich clusters
of galaxies; however, the ‘cluster’ appears to have only one
visible galaxy.
Anisotropies arising from the S-Z eﬀect, in a cosmo-
logical population of groups and clusters of galaxies con-
taining hot intra-cluster gas may be an important cause of
anisotropy power at l>∼103(Persi et al. 1995; Bond & My-
ers 1996). The S-Zanisotropies are generically non-Gaussi an
and are expected to have phase-correlations between dif-
ferentlmodes; their statistical description requires higher-
order correlations apart from the Clpower spectra. Hot gas
in groups and clusters in scale-invariant CDM universes nor -
malized to give σ8= 1 (the magnitude of dynamical cluster-
ing at the present time is quantiﬁed by σ8which is the rms
mass ﬂuctuations in 8 h−1-Mpc spheres) is expected to con-
tribute band powers Qflat≈2µK atl≈1–5×103(Bond &
Myers 1996). In COBE-normalized tilted CDM, MDM and
models in which the shape factor Γ = Ω ◦his approximately
0.2, the predicted σ8agrees better with galaxy clustering
andinthese models thebandpowers at large lare 1–2 orders
of magnitude smaller. The dominant contribution at high l
may come from quasar-ionized hot gas bubbles (Aghanim et
al. 1996), whose existence is based on plausible theoretica l
inferences.
Computations of the expected secondary anisotropies
involve non-linear gravitational dynamics and hydrody-
namic simulations and are critically dependent on the ther-
mal history of the gas that may in turn depend on the astro-
physical evolution in populations that cause the ionizatio n.
It follows that observations of the arcmin-scale anisotrop y,
corresponding to measurements of the CMB anisotropy at
l>∼103, could constrain the structure formation theories.
2 OBSERVATIONS WITH THE AUSTRALIA
TELESCOPE
The advantages ofFourier-Synthesisimaging telescopes, a nd
in particular the design features of the Australia Telescop e
Compact Array (ATCA; see The Australia Telescope 1992)
that make it speciﬁcally advantageous for high-brightness -
sensitivity imaging, were detailed in Subrahmanyan et al.
(1993) and we restrict ourselves to giving a synopsis of the
methodology here. Our observing strategy has been to make
full Earth-rotation synthesis observations of ‘empty’ ﬁel ds
in a special ultra-compact 122-m array conﬁguration – with
ﬁve22-m diameter antennae located 30.6 m apart in an E-W
line – in order to maximize the brightness sensitivity of the
imaging. The three baselines between antennae spaced 61 m
apart are used to construct a model of the foreground con-
fusion; this is then subtracted from all of the visibility da ta
and the four baselines between antennae 30.6 m apart are
used to synthesize an image with high brightness sensitiv-
ity. Because the confusing sources are measured simultane-
ously and using baselines between the very same antennae,errors in the estimation of confusion owing to variability i n
the foreground sources and calibration errors are eliminat ed.
Deconvolutionerrorsare avoidedbecausetheconfusion ise s-
timated as a model ﬁt to visibility data. These observations
were made at the highest available frequency of 8.7 GHz to
minimize discrete source confusion.
The ﬁeldwas separately observedin anearlyscaled 244-
m array at 4.7 GHz, with ﬁve ATCA antennae spaced 61-m
apart along the E-W line, to examine the spectral indices of
any features identiﬁed in the region as foreground sources
and ensure that the sources subtracted indeed have spectra
consistent with optically-thin thermal or synchrotron emi s-
sion. If the 4.7-GHz images are made with the same sensi-
tivity to point-source ﬂux density as the 8.7-GHz images,
the lower-frequency images that are made with the same
angular resolution would be less sensitive to CMB temper-
ature ﬂuctuations by a factor (4 .7/8.7)α, where α= 2 is
the spectral index of the CMB anisotropy at these frequen-
cies. However, the 4.7-GHz images would have a relatively
greater sensitivity to extended synchrotron emission by a
factor (4 .7/8.7)α, whereα<∼−0.7 is now the steep spectral
index of extended synchrotron sources. To summarize, the
4.7-GHz image could potentially reveal extended foregroun d
sources that may be resolved, and therefore absent, in the
61-m baseline data obtained at 8.7 GHz.
Sky regions – selected using radio source catalogues to
be relatively devoid of bright sources – were ﬁrst imaged at
20-cm wavelength with the ATCA. An examination of these
images led to the selection of a ﬁeld centre which had no
sources with ﬂux densities exceeding 1 mJy (at 20-cm wave-
length) within 7 arcmin radius (the ATCA antennae have
the ﬁrst null of the 8.7-GHz primary beam at 7 arcmin).
The J2000.0-epoch coordinates of the ﬁeld centre are RA:
03h16m26.s00, DEC: −49◦47′57.′′00. The ﬁeld has been
chosen to be located close to declination −50◦so that the
projected antenna spacing is as close as possible without
shadowing to the 22-m antenna diameter at large hour an-
gles: this maximizes the brightness sensitivity of the arra y.
The ﬁeld was originally observed in 1991 July-August
and December in the 122-m array and using a pair of 128-
MHz bands centred at 8640 and 8768 MHz; results of the ob-
servations made during these periods were reported in Sub-
rahmanyan et al. (1993). Subsequently, the 8.7-GHz front-
end ampliﬁers were changed to HEMT devices and the sys-
tem temperature at this frequency improved from about 75
to 43 K. The ﬁeld was reobserved in 1994 July in the 122-
m array using the same pair of bands. The total eﬀective
observing time obtained in this array now corresponds to
about 50 h integration with a system temperature of 43 K
and two 128-MHz bands. The rms sensitivity of the imaging
has improved by a factor 1.6 as a result of the additional
observations made with the improved receivers. All obser-
vations were made in dual polarizations. The array phase
centres during the observations were oﬀset about 1◦from
the antenna pointing centres so that imaging artefacts that
often appear at the phase centre may be well removed from
the sky region of interest. Oﬀ-line, the visibility data wer e
phase-corrected to align the array phase centres with the
ﬁeld centre positions, calibrated in amplitude, phase and f or
the band-pass response, averaged in frequency over a useful
band of 112 MHz. The ﬂux-density scale was set by adopt-
ing values of 2.84 and 2.79 Jy respectively for the primary
c/circlecopyrt1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000ATCA observations for CMB anisotropy 3
calibrator source PKS 1934 −638 at the frequencies 8640 and
8768 MHz (Reynolds 1994).
In 1995 March, the ﬁeld was observed in a 244-m ar-
ray at 4800 MHz. The observing and calibration procedure
adopted was the same as for the 122-m array observations;
the ﬂux-density scale was set by adopting a value of 6.22 Jy
for the primary calibrator PKS 1934 −638 at this frequency.
All images shown below were made using visibilities
with ‘natural’ weighting so as to obtain a high signal-to-
noise ratio, the gridding, Fourier transformations and de-
convolution, if attempted, were done using the aipsroutine
imagr. All displayed images are centred at the coordinates
of the ﬁeld centre and, unless explicitely stated, have not
been deconvolved. All images shown are in Stokes I and have
not been corrected for the attenuation owing to the primary
beam. The locus of the ﬁrst null in the primary beam pat-
tern at 8704 MHz, located at a radius of 7 arcmin, is shown
in all the images as a dot-dashed circle.
3 ANALYSIS OF THE OBSERVED FIELD
An image of the ﬁeld made at 4.8 GHz using the 61 and
122-m baselines of the 244-m array observations is shown in
Fig. 1. The image has been deconvolved and has a resolu-
tion of 1.4 arcmin. Within a radius of 3 arcmin, correspond-
ing to the half-power radius of the ATCA primary beam at
8.7 GHz, three prominent sources are apparent and all these
are detected with peak ﬂux density exceeding 10 times the
image thermal noise.
In Fig. 2 we show an image of this ﬁeld at 8.7 GHz that
has been constructed using just the four 30.6-m baselines.
This image has not been deconvolved, but clearly shows
three peaks at the positions of the three sources apparent
in the 4.8-GHz image. It may be noted that the synthesized
beam sidelobes are very large for this image because of the
pooru,vcoverage (only a single spacing – 30.6 m – has been
used in the imaging).
The low-resolution 8.7-GHz image of the ﬁeld (Fig. 2)
has a high surface brightness sensitivity, but is confusion
limited owing to discrete sources in the ﬁeld. We estimate
the foreground confusion owing to discrete sources in this
ﬁeld using the data obtained in the longer ( >30.6 m) base-
lines. However, we have restricted ourselves to using just
the 61-m baseline (omitting the 92 and 122 m baselines) for
deriving the confusion model so that the synthesized beam
is only a factor of two smaller as compared to that for the
high-surface-brightness image (Fig. 2) from which the co-
fusion is to be subtracted. This may ensure that confusion
structures on scales up to about an arcmin, if present, may
be included in the confusion model.
We next show a deconvolved image of the ﬁeld made
at 8.7 GHz using the 61-m baselines (Fig. 3). Three sources
appear once again, we estimate their positions and ﬂux den-
sities at 8.7 GHz from this deconvolved image and use these
parameters as an input model while ﬁtting a 3-component
model to the 61-m visibility data. The ﬁt estimated the ﬂux
densities of the components to be 274, 182 and 110 µJy. The
primary beam at 8.7 GHz is expected tohave attenuated the
source intensities by factors 0.57, 0.39 and 0.51 respectiv ely.
Correcting for this attenuation, the components ought to
have ﬂux densities 481, 467 and 216 µJy respectively. We
have ﬁt the 4.8-GHz visibilities measured using the 122-mFigure 1. Deconvolved image of the ﬁeld at 4800 MHz made

Correcting for theattenuation owingtothe primarybeam at
4.8 GHz, we estimate the true ﬂux densities of these compo-
nents to be 934, 439 and 319 µJy respectively. The derived
spectral indices of the components are −1.1, 0.1 and −0.7
(we deﬁne the spectral index αasSν∼να); the componentsdo not have spectral indices α= 2 that would be expected
of CMB anisotropies at these frequencies.
The three-component model for the foreground confu-
sion, derived from the ﬁt to the 60-m visibilities obtained a t
8.7 GHz, was subtracted from all of the 8.7-GHz visibility
data. Following subtraction of the confusion, we construct ed
an image of the ﬁeld at 8.7 GHz using just the 30.6-m base-
lines (Fig. 4). No residual features are apparent in this im-
age. We weighted the image pixel intensities by the primary
beam pattern and determined the weighted rms in the pri-
mary beam region of the ﬁeld to be 21 .2µJy beam−1. The
image pixel variance appears consistent with that expected
from the telescope thermal noise (see section 4.1), and in
sections 5 and 6 below we use this residual image to derive
limits on random-phase CMB anisotropy on the 2-arcmin
scale corresponding to the resolution in this image.
4 CONTRIBUTORS TO THE IMAGE
VARIANCE
The processes which lead to the synthesized image are
shown schematically in Fig. 5. The telescope thermal noise,
foreground discrete sources and possibly CMB anisotropy
contribute to the variance in the synthesized image. CMB
anisotropy and foreground radio sources on the sky are
attenuated by the primary-beam pattern of the antennae
and convolved by the synthesized beam; their contribution
may equivalently be viewed as a visibility-domain spatial-
frequency ﬁltering of the sky signals as viewed through the
primary beam. The telescope thermal noise may be consid-
ered to be additive Gaussian random ﬂuctuations, that are
characterized by an appropriate angular coherence functio n,
but whose distribution on the sky image has no dependence
on the primary beam.
The primary beam plays an important role in the signal
path from sky sources to visibility data (or equivalently th e
synthesized image) and the l-space ﬁlter function that deter-
minesthecouplingofCMB power toimage variancedepends
on the antenna aperture illumination function. Therefore,
instead of modelling the primary beam in the sky plane,
we have approximated the aperture illumination by a func-
tion whose parameters characterize the central blockage an d
edge taper (James 1987) and have used parameter values
that give an antenna power pattern that ﬁts the measured
pattern out to the second null.
The number of independent pixels in the sky image
made with just the 30.6-m baseline data, or equivalently the
number of degrees of freedom in the variance estimate, may
be approximately the number of independent visibility mea-
surementsalongthe170mlongvisibilitytrack.The ﬁrstnul l
of the ATCA primary beam power pattern is at 7 arcmin ra-
dius at 8.7 GHz, this implies that the aperture illumination
has an autocorrelation function with an eﬀective diameter o f
about 17 m and hence the number of independent visibility
measurements is about 10.
4.1 Telescope system noise
The image variance resulting from the telescope thermal
noise has been measured by two methods. First, by com-
puting the rms over large sky regions well outside the pri-
mary beam area where the only contribution to the image

variance is expected to be the telescope thermal noise. Sec-
ond, by separately imaging the visibilities obtained as the
XX and YY correlations between the two orthogonal linear
antenna signals X and Y and computing the rms over the
(XX−YY)/2 image: the Stokes I component of sources in
the ﬁeld cancel in this combined image and if we assume
that the Stokes Q, U and V ﬂux densities are negligible
compared to the thermal noise, the system thermal noise
will be the only signiﬁcant contributor to the variance in
this combined image. The two methods have yielded consis-
tent values and the rms thermal noise in the sky image is
estimated to be 22.8 µJy beam−1in the image of the ﬁeld
made using the 30.6-m baseline data. Adopting an antenna
eﬃciency of 0.64 at 8.7 GHz (James 1985) the rms noise in
the image is consistent with the system temperatures be-
ing eﬀectively 72 and 43.5 K respectively during the 1991
and 1994 epoch observations; the later value is in agreement
with 1994 epoch measurements of the system temperature
made with microwave absorbers placed over the feed horns
(Gough 1994).
Alongthevisibilitytracksinthe u,v-domain,thesignal-
to-noise ratio of the visibility data may vary because, for
example, the total system temperature may systematically
varywith antennaelevation and hencewith position angle in
theu,v-plane, or because data points may have diﬀerent av-
eraging times. Visibility data are almost never weighted pr o-
portional to the rms thermal noise; they are often weighted
inversely with the thermal noise variance. Therefore, the i m-
age thermal noise is described by a coherence function that
is usually not derivable from the synthesized beam. To com-
pute the angular coherence function of the thermal noise, or
equivalently the distribution of thermal noise power in the
u,v-domain, we use images made well outside the primary
beam area: we compute the 2D autocorrelation function ofthese sky images and perform a 2D Fourier transform to the
u,v-domain. This provides us with a u,v-domain ﬁlter ap-
propriate for the telescope thermal noise. Our simulations
of the thermal noise component in the sky images have
assumed the noise to be Gaussian random, with a power
spectrum identical to this 2D u,v-plane ﬁlter function and
normalized to give an image rms noise same as the above-
mentioned measured values.
The variance in the sky images have been determined
by weighting the pixel intensities with the primary beam
attenuation. We have simulated images with solely the ex-
pected thermal noise contribution, computed the weighted
image variances and obtained their distribution function.
It may be noted that because the variance estimate is the
weighted sum of squares of random variables, the variance
is not expected to follow a χ2distribution.
4.2 Foreground radio source confusion
The radio sources in the sky are assumed to be Poisson dis-
tributed and the diﬀerential source count N(S) is expected
to be
N(S) = 20.9S−2.18arcmin−2µJy−1(2)
at 8.7 GHz, where Sis the source ﬂux density in µJy
(Partridge et al. 1997 and references therein). The ATCA
Fourier-synthesis images have been constructed without an y
zero-spacing visibility components and at every image pixe l
position the expectation for the ﬂux density is zero despite
the presence of discrete sources in the sky. The expectation

whereyminandymaxare the lower and upper limits to the
ﬂux densities of sources present in the sky region and b(θ,φ)
represents a beam pattern that is the product of the pri-
mary beam centred at the antenna pointing centre and the
synthesized beam centred at ( θ◦,φ◦).
We reckon, based on our 1.4-GHz survey of the region,
that the ﬁeld has no sources exceeding about 0.5 mJy at
8.7 GHz. The variance in the image made using the 30.6-m
baseline data (Fig. 2) is a factor of two higher than that ex-
pected owing to these sources assuming the Partridge et al.
source counts. However, there is a reasonable (11 per cent)
statistical probability that the ‘excess’ variance in the ﬁ eld
is foreground confusion. The number of sources (3) detected
with ﬂux density exceeding 100 µJy – that constitute the
model for confusion in the ﬁeld – and their combined ﬂux
density, are also a factor of two larger than expected. A pos-
sible explanation for these is that our 3-component model
for confusion includes weaker sources that blend and give
responses above the detection limit.
Following the subtraction of the confusion model, the
residual image shown in Fig. 4 does not show evidence for
any signiﬁcant ‘excess’ variance that may be owing to resid-
ual weak foreground sources that have not been included
in the model. For the assumed source counts, the expected
variance contribution from sources weaker than 100 µJy is
(50µJy beam−1)2. The residual image shown in Fig. 4 has
a variance of (21.2 µJy beam−1)2and the probability of ob-
serving a sample image with a variance as low as this is
2×10−4if sources below 100 µJy have remained unsub-
tracted! If we conjecture that the model derived from the
61-m baseline visibility data has incorporated all sources
above 25 µJy, corresponding to the rms thermal noise in the
image made with these data, we may then expect that the
residual sources in the ﬁeld that are weaker than this limit
may contribute a variance of about (33 µJy beam−1)2in im-
ages made from the residual 30.6-m baseline data. Even in
this optimistic scenario, the probability of observing a sa m-
ple with a residual variance as low as that in the observed
ﬁeld is as small as 0.3 per cent!
To summarize, the image variance appears to be in ex-
cess of the expectation prior to any subtraction of sources,
but after the confusion model is subtracted the image vari-
ance is below expectations that are derived assuming a
minimal residual and unsubtracted confusion. We are led
to believe that either the derived confusion model includes
sources weakerthan25 µJy,orperhapsthatthefaint sources
are clustered. We are expanding our observations to several
sky regions and expect to have a better understanding of
the contribution from confusion following an examination o f
the residual ﬂuctuations in a larger sky area. While derivin g
limits on CMB anisotropy in sections 5 and 6 based on our
observations of the ﬁeld, we assume that the residual im-
age has contributions from the telescope thermal noise and
CMB anisotropy alone.
We have examined the possibility of using the skew co-
eﬃcient a3as a possible indicator of residual foregroundconfusion. a3is deﬁned as

and where the summations are over pixel intensities that
are weighted by the primary-beam attenuations at the pixel
locations. We ﬁnd that the image in Fig. 2 has a3= 0.13
and the residual image in Fig. 4 has a3=−0.03. Our simu-
lations of foreground confusion show that the derived skew
coeﬃcient may be expected to have a standard deviation of
as much as 0.57 about the mean skew, and that the expecta-
tion for the skew coeﬃcient is just 0.11 and 0.05 respectivel y
if foreground sources below 100 and 25 µJy remain unsub-
tracted. Because of the limited number of independent sky

4.3 CMB anisotropy
We model the CMB anisotropy as a Gaussian random ﬂuc-
tuation in the sky temperature that is completely described
by its power spectrum coeﬃcients Cl. The expectation for
the image variance will then depend on the telescope ﬁlter
function (TFF) Fland the nature of the anisotropy power
spectrum over the range in l-space that corresponds to the
pass-band of the ﬁlter.
We assume that the anisotropy power spectrum is ‘ﬂat’
inl(l+1)-space and that the Clcoeﬃcients are given by
Cl= (Qflat)2/parenleftbigg

whereQflatdenotes the quadrupole normalization of the
power spectrum. The temperature variance in the sky image
is then expected to be
(∆T)2=/summationdisplay
l(2l+1)Cl
4πFl (6)
and this leads to the expression in equation (1).
We compute the image variance as a weighted mean of
the squares of the pixel intensities (image pixel intensiti es
are in units of Jy beam−1) using weights for the intensi-
ties that are the primary-beam attenuations at the pixel
positions. As discussed in Appendix A, we have computed
the ATCA TFFs at the diﬀerent image pixel locations us-
ing equation (A4) and averaged them, using weights that
are again the primary-beam attenuations, to obtain the ﬁl-
ter function Fl, in units of (Jy beam−1K−1)2, appropriate
to the computed image variance. We have computed the
Fl’s using the ATCA synthesized beams corresponding sep-
arately to the images made with the 30.6 and 61-m base-
line data, they are shown in Fig. 6. In the large- lregime
of the ATCA Fl, the expected image variance (in units of
(Jy beam−1)2) is approximately given by

The TFF corresponding to the 30.6-m baseline data,

corresponding to the residual image shown in Fig. 4. It has

If we adopt a ‘ﬂat’ CMB anisotropy spectrum with nor-
malization Qflat= 18µK corresponding to the detected
power at multipoles l<∼20 (4-yr COBE DMR results in
Bennett et al. 1996), the expected variance contribution in
the 30.6-m baseline image is expected to be 182×0.765 =
(15.7µJy beam−1)2.
A Fourier synthesis telescope with ﬁnite-aperture ele-
ments measures visibilities that may be considered to be the
convolution of the all-sky visibility with the autocorrela tion
oftheantennaaperture illumination. The visibilitymeasu re-
ments may be viewed as samples along 1D ( u,v)-tracks of
this 2D ( u,v)-plane visibility function. Because the ATCA
antenna aperture extends 11 m in radius, its autocorrelatio n
function will extend to a radius of 22 m. It may be noted
that this autocorrelation function has a diameter of 44 m
which exceeds the spacing between the 1D ( u,v)-tracks cor-
responding to the 30.6 and 61 m baselines. Therefore, the
visibility data along the 30.6 and 61-m baseline visibility
tracks are individually averages over regions of the all-sk y
visibility function and these regions mutually overlap. Th is
results in a partial overlap between the TFFs correspond-
ing to the 30.6 and 61-m visibility data. At any instant,
there are three 61-m baselines as compared to four 30.6-m
baselines; therefore, the 61-m baseline image is less sensi tive
to unresolved foreground sources as compared to the 30.6-
m baseline data, but by only a factor 0.87. The peak of the
TFF corresponding to the 61-m baseline data is 0.087, a fac-tor 0.18 of the peak of the 30.6-m baseline TFF. Summing
over the 61-m baseline TFF,/summationtext

anisotropy with a ﬂat spectrum will be expected to con-
tribute a variance in the 61-m baseline image that is a factor
0.11 of the variance in the 30.6-m baseline image. Adopting
a normalization Qflat= 18µK, the 61-m baseline image is
expected to have a variance contribution (5 .2µJy beam−1)2
from CMB anisotropy. Because (a) the two TFFs have only
a small overlap and are largely sampling CMB power at dif-
ferent multipole ranges and (b) the 61-m baseline TFF has
a greatly reduced sensitivity to CMB anisotropy, the con-
fusion model that is derived from the 61-m baseline data is
unlikely to signiﬁcantly reduce the CMB anisotropy power
expected in the residual 30.6-m baseline image.
We have simulated sky images by generating ‘ﬂat’ spec-
trum CMB power in the ( u,v)-plane: pixels of size δu, δv
that are at distance√

plane are given Gaussian random complex conjugate visibil-
ities with variance

The (u,v)-plane CMB anisotropy model is then ﬁltered by
the TFF corresponding to the 30.6-m baseline data and
inverted to form simulated sky images. We have thereby
obtained distributions of the sample variance from simu-
lated images that have variance contribution from CMB
anisotropy alone. It may be noted here that the radial dis-
tribution of power in the ( u,v)-plane in the case of our ‘ﬂat’
model CMB anisotropy diﬀers from that for thermal noise
and, therefore, the two contributions diﬀer in the number of
degrees of freedom in their contributions to image variance .

hypothesis IH 2thatQflat= 22.4µK. The dotted line corresponds to the distribution function assuming that ‘ﬂat’ spectrum CMB
anisotropy with Qflat= 22.4µK is the only contributor to the image variance.
5 LIMITS ON CMB FLAT-BAND POWER
We use the likelihood-ratio test to derive limits on pos-
sible CMB ﬂat-band power in the data. We assume that
the residual image has contributions only from the telescop e
thermal noise and possibly CMB anisotropy. The observed
variance in the residual image shown in Fig. 4 is
σ2
obs= (21.2µJy beam−1)2. (10)
We adopt the null hypothesis IH 1that the variance con-
tribution from CMB anisotropy is zero.
IH1:σ2
CMB= 0. (11)
Simulations of sky images that have only thermal noise with
an expected variance (22 .8µJy beam−1)2then yields the
probability distribution for the sample variance. We show
this distribution as the dashed line in Fig. 7 and represents
the likelihood function IP( σ2
obs|0) which is the probability of
obtaining any observed variance conditional on IH 1.
We next hypothesize that the sky has ﬂat-band CMB
anisotropy quantiﬁed by the normalization Qflat,i.e.,
IH2:σ2
CMBcorresponding to Qflat. (12)
We simulate sky images with purely CMB anisotropy to ob-
tain the distribution function for its variance contributi on;
we show this distribution in Fig. 7 as a dotted line for the
speciﬁc choice Qflat= 22.4µK. The distribution function
for the observed image variance, with contributions fromthermal noise and CMB anisotropy, will be a convolution of
the two individual probability distributions. This distri bu-
tion, shown as a continuous curve in Fig. 7, represents the
likelihood function IP( σ2
obs|Qflat) which is the probability of
obtaining any observed variance conditional on IH 2.
The size αof the test is the probability of rejecting
IH2when it is true (a type ierror). For the choice Qflat=
22.4µK,α= 0.05 and, therefore, Qflat= 22.4µK is a 95
per cent conﬁdence upper limit.
The power βof the test is deﬁned as: β= 1−proba-
bility of accepting IH 2when IH 1is true (a type iierror). For
our choice of Qflat= 22.4µK, the power β= 0.47. In order
to increase the power of the test to a value β= 0.5, we may
increase the decision variance to σ2
obs= (21.8µJy beam−1)2
and change the hypothesis IH 2to correspond to a choice
Qflat= 23.6µK. For this choice of parameters, the test will
reject IH 2with size α= 0.05 (95 per cent conﬁdence) and
the test will simultaneously have a power β= 0.5.
To summarize, the ATCA observations of the ﬁeld place
an upper limit of Qflat<23.6µK with 95 per cent conﬁ-
dence in an l-space ﬁlter that peaks at l= 4700. The ﬁlter
has half-maximum values at l= 3350 and 6050.

Assuming that the sky temperature variance C◦is an
invariant, the expected image variance (∆ S)2is a maximum
for an anisotropy model with ξc= 1 arcmin. We have sim-
ulated sky images with the CMB anisotropy modelled to
have a GACF and derived the distribution function for the
image variance contribution. Limits to the model parameter
C◦may be derived for speciﬁc choices of the coherence scale
ξcusing the likelihood ratio test described in the previous
section.
Adopting a value ξc= 1 arcmin, we ﬁnd that the ob-
served image variance of σ2

a 95 per cent conﬁdence upper limit of 42 µK onC1
2◦. This
result corresponds to a test with size α= 0.05 and power
β= 0.44. Requiring that the test have a power βof at least
0.5 relaxes the 95 per cent conﬁdence upper limit to a value
C1
2◦= 45µK. We have tabulated these limits along with
those for models with coherence scales of 0.5 and 2 arcmin
in Table 1.7 A COMPARISON WITH OTHER
MEASUREMENTS OF CMB ANISOTROPY
The best upper bounds reported to date in observations
with the Owens Valley radio observatory (OVRO) is that
the fractional ﬂuctuations in the CMB sky is limited to
∆T/T <1.7×10−5at a resolution of 2 arcmin; C1
2◦/T◦<
1.9×10−5in the case of ﬂuctuations with a GACF and
a coherence scale of 2 .′6 (OVRO NCP experiment: Read-
head et al. 1989). Sensitive imaging observations with the
Very Large Array (VLA) at 8.4 GHz have been used to
place a limit of 2 .0×10−5on the fractional temperature
ﬂuctuations (∆ T/T) in the CMB at a resolution of 1 ar-
cmin (VLA experiment: Partridge et al. 1997). Assuming
that the CMB anisotropy has a GACF form, an upper limit
of ∆T/T<=2.1×10−5has been set for a coherence scale
of 1.′1 based on observations at 142 GHz using a 6-element
bolometer array (SuZIE experiment: Church et al. 1997).
The SuZIE observations have also been used to derive a 2- σ
upperlimit of Qflat<26µK atan eﬀective l∼2340 (Ganga
et al. 1997). Among these three observations, the ﬁrst two
have sensitivities per resolution element that are compara -
ble toour ATCA observations. The SuZIEobservations have
covered a larger sky region. The ATCA observations pre-

APPENDIX A: TELESCOPE FILTER
FUNCTIONS (TFF)
In the case of CMB anisotropy experiments that are done
using single-dish telescopes with a speciﬁed beam switch-
ing scheme, the telescope beam is usually described by a
2D function on the sky that is normalized to unit volume.
The antenna temperature measured at any sky position is
then the mean sky brightness temperature weighted by the
beam pattern. The antenna temperatures obtained at a set
of sky positions (that are deﬁned by the beam switching
scheme) are combined linearly to form an estimate of the
CMB anisotropy. The ‘eﬀective’ beam on the sky is the same
linear combination of the 2D telescope beam patterns. The
TFF corresponding to the estimate of the CMB anisotropy
that is made with the ‘eﬀective’ beam is the spherical har-
monic decomposition of the ‘eﬀective’ beam pattern.
In observations for CMB anisotropy made with Fourier
synthesis telescopes, the sky temperature anisotropy is
viewed by the array through the element primary beam pat-
tern. The temperature anisotropy, attenuated by the pri-
mary beam pattern of the individual array element, is con-
volved by the synthesized beam pattern. The synthesized
beam is normalized to peak unity and has zero volume. Un-
like the case of the ‘eﬀective’ beam in beam-switched, singl e-
dish observations, the synthesized beam is not usually de-
composable into a linear combination of identical (positio n
shifted) beams that have ﬁnite volume. Therefore, the mea-
surements (image pixel intensities) in Fourier synthesis i m-
ages are integrals of the sky brightness temperature over
the synthesized beam and cannot be converted to mean (or
weighted mean)temperaturesbynormalising with anybeam
volume. The measurements will be in units of ﬂux density
(Jy) per beam rather than temperature.
For large multipole orders and small angles, the spheri-
cal harmonic decomposition may be approximated by a con-
tinuous Fourier transform and the Cl’s may be related to thesky autocorrelation function C(θ) by
Cl= 2π∞/integraldisplay
0θdθC(θ)J◦(lθ). (A1)
Multipole order l/(2π) and angular distance θ(in radians)
are Fourier transform conjugates. If the ‘eﬀective’ beam is a
purely radial function b(θ), the TFF will be similarly given
by
Fl=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2π∞/integraldisplay
0θdθb(θ)J◦(lθ)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2
. (A2)
If the ‘eﬀective’ beam is not simply a radial function, one
computes the 2D Fourier transform IF( l,ξ) of the 2D beam
b(θ,φ) and circumferentially averages |IF(l,ξ)|2to get the
ﬁlter function Fl.
The TFF in Fourier synthesis images will vary across
the image. At any image pixel location ( θ◦,φ◦), we ﬁrst de-
termine the ‘eﬀective’ beam b(θ,φ) as the product of the
primary beam centred at the antenna pointing centre and
the synthesized beam centred at ( θ◦,φ◦). The two beams
are separately normalized to have peak unity. The beam is
Fourier transformed to give
IF(l,ξ) =/integraldisplay /integraldisplay
b(θ,φ)ei(θlcosξ+φlsinξ)dθdφ. (A3)
The TFF is then derived as
Fl=1
2π2π/integraldisplay
0|IF(l,ξ)|2dξ/parenleftBig2k
λ2/parenrightBig2
. (A4)
Fl, as deﬁned in this form for Fourier-synthesis imaging, has
units (Jy beam−1K−1)2.
If the image variance is computed as a linear combina-
tion of the squares of the pixel intensities (a weighted sum
of squares), the TFF for the variance estimator may corre-
spondingly be computed as the same linear combination of
theFl’s evaluated at the individual pixel locations.
