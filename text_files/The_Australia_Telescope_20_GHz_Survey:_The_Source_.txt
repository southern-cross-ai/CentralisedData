ABSTRACT
We present the full source catalogue from the Australia Tele scope 20 GHz (AT20G) Survey.
The AT20Gis a blind radiosurveycarried out at 20 GHz with the Australia Telescope Com-
pact Array (ATCA) from 2004 to 2008, and covers the whole sky s outh of declination 0◦.
The AT20G source catalogue presented here is an order of magn itude larger than any previ-
ous catalogue of high-frequency radio sources, and include s 5890 sources above a 20 GHz
ﬂux-density limit of 40mJy. All AT20G sources have total int ensity and polarisation mea-
sured at 20 GHz, and most sources south of declination −15◦also have near-simultaneous
ﬂux-densitymeasurementsat5and8GHz.Atotalof1559sourc esweredetectedinpolarised
totalintensityat oneormoreofthe threefrequencies.
The completenessof the AT20G source catalogueis 91 per cent above100 mJybeam−1
and 79 per cent above50 mJybeam−1in regionssouth of declination −15◦. North of −15◦,
some observations of sources between 14−20hr in right ascension were lost due to bad
weather and could not be repeated, so the catalogue complete ness is lower in this region.
Eachdetectedsourcewas visuallyinspectedaspartof ourqu alitycontrolprocess,andso the
reliabilityofthe ﬁnalcatalogueisessentially100percen t.
We detect a small but signiﬁcant population of non-thermal s ources that are either un-
detected or have only weak detections in low-frequency cata logues. We introduce the term
Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) to describe these radio sour ces, which have a spectral index
α(5,20)>+0.7andwhichconstituteroughly1.2percentoftheAT20Gsample .
The 20 GHz ﬂux densities measured for the strongest AT20G sou rces are in excellent
agreementwith the WMAP 5-yearsource catalogue of Wrightet al. (2009), and we ﬁnd that
theWMAP sourcecatalogueis closetocompleteforsourcesst rongerthan1.5Jyat 23GHz.

Large-area high-frequency radio surveys are time-consumi ng, and
as a result relatively few large scale surveys have been carr ied out.c/circlecopyrt2008 RAS2Murphyetal.
Those that have been completed are either deep but covering s mall
areas,or shallow all-skysurveys. Asa result,ourknowledg e ofthe
highfrequency ( >10GHz) radiosource population is poor.
In addition to the scientiﬁc beneﬁts of studying the radio
source population at high frequencies, large scale surveys are use-
ful for foreground subtraction for Cosmic Microwave Backgr ound
(CMB) experiments. Measurement of CMB anisotropies is lim-
itedby contamination from astronomical foregrounds, both Galac-
tic and extragalactic. To improve the efﬁciency of the compo nent
separation techniques, observations such as those of ESA’s Planck
mission are performed on a broad spectral region ranging fro m a
few tenths to hundreds of GHz. At frequencies up to ∼100GHz,
extragalactic radio sources are the major contaminants on a ngular
scalessmallerthan30arcminutes (de Zottiet al.2005),soi dentiﬁ-
cationof radiosources at highfrequencies is critical.
The ﬁrst blind radio survey above 8 GHz was carried out by
Taylor etal. (2001) with the Ryle telescope at 15.2 GHz. The s ur-
vey covered a 63 deg2region and detected 66 sources toa limiting
ﬂux density of 20 mJy. Waldramet al. (2003) extended the surv ey
to520deg2,detecting465sources toaﬂuxdensitylimitof25mJy
(the 9C survey). Both surveys found that the existence and ﬂu x
densityofsources at15GHzcannot be accuratelypredictedb yex-
trapolation from lower frequency radio surveys such as the N RAO
VLASkySurvey(NVSS)at 1.4GHz(Condon etal.1998),further
demonstrating the need for large scale high frequency surve ys for
populationcharacterisationandsourcesubtractioninCMB studies.
The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sur-
vey, which covers the whole sky at 23, 33, 41, 61 and 94 GHz
(Bennett et al. 2003), is the ﬁrst all-sky radio survey above 5 GHz.
The WMAP Point Source Catalogue constructed from the 5 yr
maps contains 390 sources (Wrightetal. 2009), compared to 3 23
and 208 sources found in the previous 3 yr and 1 yr maps re-
spectively (Bennett et al. 2003; Hinshaw etal. 2007). Recen tly,
Massardi etal.(2009)havedetected516sourcesinthe5yrWM AP
maps byexploitingacombination ofblindandnon-blind dete ction
approaches.Section7presentsadetailedcomparisonofour AT20G
results withthe 5yr WMAPpoint-source catalogue.
Table 1 summarises some earlier large-area high-frequency
radio surveys, showing the context in which the AT20G survey
was designed. A pilot survey for the AT20G at 18.5 GHz was
carried out in 2002 and 2003 with the Australia Telescope Com -
pact Array (ATCA) (Ricci etal. 2004; Sadler etal. 2006) and d e-
tected 173 sources stronger than 100mJy in the declination r ange
−60◦to−70◦. Ricci etal. (2004) conﬁrmed that ATCA (withcus-
tom hardware) had the capability to rapidly survey the sky at high
frequencies.Thedifferentialsourcecountsforextragala cticsources
from the pilot survey were found to be ingood agreement witht he
Waldram etal. (2003)15 GHz survey.
In this paper we present the full catalogue from the Australi a
Telescope 20 GHz Survey (AT20G). The survey covers 20,086
square degrees (the complete Southern sky to declination 0◦) to
a limiting ﬂux density of 40 mJybeam−1. We followed up candi-
date sources detected in the survey at 20 GHz and also have nea r-
simultaneous follow-up observations at 5 and 8 GHz for AT20G
sources south of declination −15◦. Anaccompanying paper (Mas-
sardi et al., in preparation) will provide more detailed sta tisti-
cal analysis of the AT20G sample. A subset of the 320 brightes t

tions, and in Section 3 we describe the data reduction proces s. In
Section 4 we calculate the accuracy of our measured position s and
ﬂux densities. Section 5 presents the source catalogue and d eﬁnes

pleteness, Section 7 compares our catalogue with the 5 yr WMA P
results. Finally, Section 8 discusses some statistical pro perties of

2 OBSERVATIONS
The key feature of the AT20G is a two-phase observing strateg y.
Theﬁrstphaseofourobservationsexploitedthefastscanni ngcapa-
bilityof ATCA,using a wideband analogue correlator, tocar ry out
a blind survey. Candidate sources from the scanning survey w ere
then observed in the regular snapshot mode of the ATCA. The re -
sultsfrom the scanning survey, whichis complete toadeeper level
but has lower reliability, will be presented in a companion p aper
(Hancock etal.,inpreparation).
2.1 Surveymode
The ﬁrst phase of our observations consisted of a raster of bl ind
scans of the entire southern sky at 20 GHz, using the ATCA in
fast scanning mode (in which it can achieve a speed of 15 degre es
min−1in declination at the meridian). The ATCA has low noise
very wideband receiver1(Moorey et al. 2008) which was used to-
getherwithacustomanaloguecorrelator.Thecorrelatorha s8GHz
bandwidth (Roberts, in preparation) and was originally dev eloped
as part of the collaboration for the Taiwanese CMB experimen t
AMiBA (Loet al. 2001). We used it to take dual orthogonal po-
larizationdata from three of the six22 m dishes of the ATCA.T he
lag-correlator measured 16 visibilities as a function of di fferential
delayfor each of the three antenna pairs used.
Our custom correlator hadno mechanism for allowingfor ge-
ometricaldelayasafunctionofthepositioninthesky,soth escans
hadtobeperformedalongthemeridiancorrespondingtozero delay
fortheEast-WestconﬁgurationATCA.Allthesurveyobserva tions
used antennas 2, 3, and 4, situated on stations W102, W104, an d
W106, giving two30.6 m ( 2−3and3−4) baselines and a single
61.2m (2−4)baseline.The shortestbaseline of30.6mmeans the
survey has reduced sensitivity to extended sources (a 50 per cent
reduction in amplitude for source size >45′′). Larger sources will
only be included in the survey if they have ﬂux density in smal ler
angular size cores or hot spots above the survey limit.
The scanning strategy consisted of sweeping sky regions 10◦
or 15◦wide in declination and using Earth rotation to cover the
full 24 hour right ascension range in a zig-zag pattern. To ac hieve
Nyquistskycoverageweusedmultiplezig-zagscanningpath sover
multiple days – each day the scanning path was shifted by half a
beam width. Along the scan a sample was collected every 54 ms
(3 samples per beam), which resulted in an rms noise of 12 mJy.
Poor quality scans (due to weather or equipment error) were r e-
peated,sothattheskycoverage isasuniform aspossible. Th eana-
logue correlator outputs for each set of 24 hour observation s (in-
terleaves) were combined together and calibrated to produc e maps

schedule for eachdeclination band inthe scanning survey.
The initial calibration of the interleaves was achieved by a
daily transit observation of a nearby known calibrator. A se cond
round of calibration was based on those sources from the ATCA
calibrator catalogue2that fell within each of the interleave obser-
vations. Typically there were about 10 such sources within e ach
24hourobservation.Athirdandﬁnalroundofcalibrationwa sdone
using newlydetected strongsources withinthe map itself.
The delay steps in the analogue correlator were not precisel y
equal (as they are in a digital correlator) so the spectrum is not
quitethe sameas theFouriertransform ofthelags.Hence sta ndard
synthesis techniques using discrete Fourier transforms co uld not
be used for reliable source detection. Furthermore the poor (u,v)
coverage of the survey (30 and 60 m EW spacings only) required
a custom source detection program that worked in a CLEAN-lik e
fashion,detectingthestrongestsource,ﬁttingatemplate dirtybeam
and recording its location and ﬂux estimate before moving to the
next source. Sources brighter than 5σ(∼50mJybeam−1) were
scheduled for follow-up observations, as described in the n ext sec-
tion.
2.2 Follow-upmode
Each of the candidate sources identiﬁed in the ﬁrst phase of o bser-
vations was observed in the regular snapshot mode of the ATCA
to conﬁrm the detection and to measure an accurate position, ﬂux
density and polarisation. The ﬂux densities from the initia l scan

survey are accurate to ∼20per cent (see Hancock et al., in prepa-
ration) and so we expected a fraction of the sources to fall be low

The follow-up observations were scheduled to be as close as
practical (typically withina few weeks) to the initial surv ey obser-
vations for a particular declination band, to reduce the eff ects of
source variability on survey completeness. Table 3 lists th e details
of each follow-up run, including the shortest antenna spaci ng and
resolutionat eachfrequency.
The 20 GHz follow-up observations were performed using a
hybrid array conﬁguration (i.e., one in which there were Nor th-
SouthaswellasEast-Westbaselines)withthestandardATCA dig-
italcorrelator.Weusedtwo128MHzbandscentredat 18752MHz
and21056MHzandtwopolarisations.Duringdata processingthe
two bands were combined to form a single 256 MHz wide band
centered at 19904MHz which is the reference frequency for our
20GHz observations.
Candidate sources wereprioritisedfor follow-upobservat ions

targets, with a nearby secondary calibrator observed for ∼5min-
utes at the beginning and end of each block. The sources withi n

or more 40 second cuts for each source, at different hour angl es,
so as to obtain reasonable ( u,v) plane coverage. Fig. 1 shows a
schematic of the observing schedule. Using this method up to 500
candidate sources were observed eachday.
Fordeclinations <−15◦each20GHzobservingrunwasfol-
lowedbylowerfrequencyobservations ofthesamesetsofsou rces.
In these runs we used an East-West extended array conﬁgurati on,
with two 128 MHz bands centred at 4800MHz and 8640MHz.
For the rest of this paper, these frequencies will be referre d to as
‘5’and‘8’GHz.Thelowerfrequencyobservationswerecondu cted

tain near simultaneous spectral data for our sample. Source s in the
mostnortherndeclinationband( δ >−15◦)werenotobservedat5
and 8 GHz because of the poor ( u,v) coverage of EW arrays near
the equator.
We completed several extra observing runs, at both 20 and
5/8 GHz for the purposes of replacing bad quality data from pr e-
vious runs. Table 3 lists the details of our observing runs, w ith the
ﬁrstcolumnshowingthematchinghighfrequency-lowerfreq uency
epochs. The primary beam FWHM of the ATCA is 2.4,5.5, and
9.9arcminat 20, 8,and 5GHz,respectively.
2.3 AdditionalObservations
Inadditiontothemainsurveydescribedinthispaper,wehav ecom-
pleted several complementary sets of observations which wi ll be
presentedinaccompanying papers.InOctober2006weobserv eda
sub-sample of the bright sources to obtain high sensitivity polari-
sation measurements (Burke-Spolaor et al. in preparation) . These
observations used the most compact conﬁguration of the ATCA
(H75), which provides the best coverage of a range of short sp ac-
ings, and longer integration times than for the main survey, so that
higher qualityimages could be made.
Nine highly extended sources were selected from low fre-
quency catalogues – PMN at 4.85 GHz (Grifﬁth&Wright 1993)
and SUMSS at 843 MHz (Mauch et al. 2003) – and observed in
mosaic mode to improve the ﬂux density estimation at 20 GHz
(Burke-Spolaor etal. 2009). Data for seven of these sources have
been incorporated into our catalogue in order to avoid ﬂux de nsity
underestimation due to resolution effects. However, since we do
not have equivalent 5 and 8 GHz observations of these objects we
cannot use these data for analyses of radiospectra.
During the AT20G follow-up survey, the 6 km antenna of the
ATCA was operational for most of the observing time, however
the data from the ﬁve much longer baselines could not be easil y
included in our standard processing pipeline. As a separate pro-
gram, we estimated the 6 km visibility by taking the ratio of t he
scalar amplitude at the 6 km baseline to the scalar amplitude at
shorter baselines. This removes the effect of atmospheric d ecorre-
lation and avoids the need to phase calibrate the long baseli nes.
Approximately 90 per cent of the AT20G sources have 6 km data
available. These 6 km visibilities allows us to identify sou rces that
appearpoint-likeinthecompact conﬁguration,butextende donthe
0.3arcsecscale corresponding tothe6km baselines.Theful lanal-
ysis and results from this high resolution follow-up will be pre-
sented in Chhetri et al. (in preparation). An immediate appl ication
ofthisdatawastheidentiﬁcationofextendedﬂatspectrums ources

by gravitational lensing. Gravitational lens candidates a re being
observed with ATCA 6 km conﬁgurations at 7 mm. The thermal
sources identiﬁed by this procedure are Galactic objects, m ainlyplanetary nebulae. They are ﬂagged as Galactic in the main ca ta-
logue –see Section5.4.
2.4 Galactic PlaneFollow-up
Neither the scanning survey nor the follow-up observations were
well suited to imaging diffuse Galactic sources. We decided to ex-
clude sources within |b|<1.5◦from our main follow-up survey
and instead follow up selected subsamples of these sources w ith
targeted observing runs. The ﬁrst of these was the follow-up of a
sample of ultra- and hyper-compact HII regions, selected on the
basis of their rising spectral index between 843 MHz (from th e
2nd Epoch Molonglo Galactic Plane Survey (Murphy etal. 2007 ))
and 20 GHz ( α(0.843,20)>0.1). Further information is given in
Murphy etal. (2009).
2.5 VariabilitySample
Many large-area radio continuum surveys have been conducte d at
frequencies of 1.4 GHz or below, where the long-term variabi lity
of most radio sources is low. As a result, the source catalogu es
from these surveys can continue to be used with a high level of
conﬁdence for many years after the survey was made. This is no t
necessarilytrue for surveys at frequencies above 5GHz, whe re the
source populationisincreasinglydominatedbyﬂat-spectr umradio
sourceswhichareexpectedtobevariable(e.g.Condon etal. 1989).
Tostudythevariabilityofthe20GHzradio-sourcepopulati on
ontimescales of years, we re-observed a sample of 170source s (at
declination −60◦to−70◦and with 20 GHz ﬂux densities above
100 mJy) at several epochs over the course of the AT20G survey .
All the sources in this variability sample were originally d etected
intheAT20GPilotSurveyin2002–2003(Ricci etal.2004),gi ving
uptoﬁve epochs of observation for some of these sources.
Theearly(2002–2004) 20GHzdataforthevariabilitysample
arediscussedbySadleret al.(2006),whoconcludethattheg eneral
levelofvariabilityinsourcesselectedat20GHzisrelativ elylowon
timescalesof 1−2years,withamedianvariabilityindexof6.9per
cent at 20 GHz over a one-year time interval. We therefore exp ect
the AT20Gcatalogue presented here tobe reasonably stable, inthe
sense that if we were to reobserve the survey area on timescal es of
afewyears,wouldexpectthenewsourcecataloguetocontain most
of the same sources as the oldone.
The AT20G catalogue presented in this paper only lists a sin-
gle epoch for sources in the variability sample (typically t he 2004
observation, except in cases of poor-quality data). A separ ate pa-
per (Sadler et al., in preparation) will present a full catal ogue and
detailedanalysis of the AT20G variabilitysample.

3.2 Calibration
Primary ﬂux calibration and bandpass calibration were done in
the standard way using PKSB1934 −638, withthe assumed ﬂuxes
shown in Table 4. More information about the ATCA ﬂux scale at
20GHz is giveninSault(2003).

observations we typically observed around ∼50secondary cali-
brators. To calculate an accurate ﬂux density for each secon dary
calibrator we calculated the mean of the individual snapsho t ﬂuxTable 4.Assumed ﬂuxes for the primary calibrator PKSB1934 −638.

3.3.2 Extended source ﬂuxes
Sources that are partially resolved, or have multiple compo nents,
are not well-characterised by the triple product ﬂux measur ement.
Weidentiﬁedextended sources inour sample usingseveral cr iteria
based on the ratio of the triple product ﬂuxdensity to the ﬂux den-
sity measured on the shortest baseline. We visually inspect ed the
20 GHz visibilities and images for each of these sources, to c on-

For the extended sources, we calculated the integrated ﬂux

assumed to be extended at 5 and 8GHz. Inmost cases the shortes t

Nine of the extremely extended sources were observed
separately and we have used the ﬂux densities determined in
Burke-Spolaor etal. (2009) forseven of them. These are disc ussed
inSection5.1.
3.4 Imaging
We imaged all sources using the standard Miriad process, and de-
convolved them with a small number of CLEAN iterations (typi -
cally50).Thiswasdoneprimarilyforthepurposeofvisuali nspec-
tion, since all ﬂux densities were determined using the trip le prod-
uct as discussed in the previous section. Fig. 4 shows exampl es of
a typical point source, AT20G J004441 −353034, and a typical ex-
tended source, AT20G J110622 −210858, at all three frequencies
plus the total polarizedintensity.

lation, which would affect both polarized and total ﬂux dens ity in
the same way.
The polarised ﬂux was measured at the position of the peak
in the Stokes I image. This will be equivalent to the integrat ed po-
larization for the unresolved sources but will be neither th e peak
nor the integrated polarization for the extended sources. F or the

(usually due to there being a poor quality observation in the ear-
lier epoch) we selected the best source based on the data qual ity,
the presence of near-simultaneous 5/8 GHz data and the offse t of
the source from the imaging pointing centre. For sources tha t were

theﬁrstepochofobservationexceptincaseswherethatobse rvation
was of poor quality.
Due to the poor ( u,v) coverage of the scanning survey, a
small percentage of the sources scheduled for follow-up obs erva-
tions were in fact sidelobes of the main source. Fig. 5 shows a
typical AT20G source as detected in the images created from t he
scanning survey. The scanning survey has only two different base-
lines (EW30 mand 60m) sothe images have veryhighsidelobes.
In some cases bright sidelobes were inadvertently followed -up.
We excluded sidelobes automatically by grouping all ‘dupli cate’
sourceswithinaradiusof100arcsec(theeffectivebeamsiz eofthe
scanning survey) and ﬁltering to keep only the strongest sou rce in
the group. Cross-matching withlow frequency surveys alsoh elped
toconﬁrm these selections.
All sources were then inspected by several members of the
AT20G team, using an online annotation tool. We used this as a
ﬁnalquality control procedure, andtoidentify anyremaini ng side-
lobes. We also used this process to identify extended source s that
were not classiﬁedbyour automatic selectioncriteria.

sion and declination for the full sample, giving σα= 0.9arcsec
andσδ= 1.0arcsec. Note that this method of calculating posi-
tional errors mayunderestimate the error for extended sour ces.
4.2 Fluxdensityuncertainties
We calculated the errors in the ﬂux density measurements by
adding in quadrature the error associated with calibration (gain er-ror,σgain) andthe error associated withthe noise level ( σn):
σ2=σ2
gainS2+σ2
n (5)
The gain error is a multiplicative term (i.e., it is proporti onal
to the source ﬂux density) and is a measure of the gain stabili ty
over time. We estimated σgainfor each observational epoch and
frequency from the scatter in the visibility amplitudes of t he cali-
brators in each observing run. The mean values for the gain er rors
werefoundtobeoforderafewpercent.Thenoisetermisanadd i-
tive term related to the interferometer noise, which is prop ortional
to the system temperature. Since no source has signiﬁcant ﬂu x in
StokesV, the rms noise levels in the Vimages have no gain error
and were used as an estimate of σn. The error in the ﬂux density
for each source is given in the main catalogue (Table 4). Typi cally
the error is 4−5per cent of the totalﬂuxdensity.
For extended sources the error was multiplied by the square
root of the number of baselines nbase(normally 10 for our 5-
antenna follow-up arrays) to correct for the fact that the ﬂu x den-
sities for these sources are estimated using only one (the sh ortest)
baseline instead of nbase.
Many of the sources inthe Australia Telescope calibrator ca t-
alogue were observed as target sources as part of the AT20G pr o-
gram.Weusedthesesourcestochecktheintegrityofourobse rving

5.1 Brightextendedsources
As discussed in Massardi et al. (2008), a small number of high ly
extended sources were expected to have a 20 GHz ﬂux density
above our bright source sample cutoff of 0.5 Jy, but were unde -
tectedorhaddiminishedlevelsofobservedemissionintheA T20G
follow-up observations due to the sources’ extent beyond ou r ob-
serving resolution and ﬁeld of view ( ∼2.4arcminutes). These
sources were identiﬁed using extrapolated ﬂux densities fr om the
5GHzPMN(Grifﬁth& Wright1993)andthe0.843MHzSUMSS
(Mauch etal. 2003) data. Integrated ﬂux density and polaris ation
measurements forthese sources (showninTable 5)were measu red
from mosaic observations done during the 2006 October polar isa-
tion follow-up run. Their ﬂux densities have been included i n our
maincatalogueandareﬂaggedwitha b.Theobservations anddata
analysisarediscussedfullyinBurke-Spolaor etal.(2009) .Theob-
jects with mosaiced measurements are limited to sources sou th of
δ=−30◦.
We note that as discussed in Section 2.1 our survey will be
incomplete for sources larger than 45′′and based on simple source
count arguments many hundred sources larger than a few arc mi n-
utes will be missing. Since non-thermal extended sources ha ve
steep radio spectra we suggest that low frequency catalogue s such
as NVSS or SUMSS rather than AT20G be used if complete sam-
ples of the extended sources are important.

5.2 Comparison withbrightsource sample
Some bright sources ( S20>0.5Jy) in this catalogue have slightly
different parameters than were given in the Bright Source Sa m-
ple(BSS)paper(Massardi et al.2008).Thereare23sourcesw hich
have a ﬂux density that differs by more than 10 per cent from th e
BSS results. In most cases this is due to a different observat ional
epoch being selected for the source in the BSS than for in the c ur-
rent catalogue. The largest group of sources in this categor y are
sources fromthe variabilitysample discussedinSection2. 5.Inthe
selection of sources for this catalogue we gave preference w here
possibletotheepochwithsimultaneous 5and8GHzobservati ons.
However, in the BSSthe best quality epoch at 20 GHz was chosen
regardless of the availabilityof follow-up at other freque ncies.
5.3 Magellanic Clouds
The AT20G survey area includes the Large and Small Magellani c
Clouds, and we would expect to ﬁnd some radio sources in these
galaxies, which are effectively foreground sources for cos molog-
ical studies. In earlier work using the AT20G pilot survey da ta,
Ricciet al.(2004)andSadler et al.(2006)simplyremoved 5◦×5◦
regions of sky around the LMC and SMC to avoid the problem
of foreground contamination. However, since the compact, h igh-
frequency LMC/SMC radio sources are likely to be interestin g in
their own right, we have now attempted to identify them indiv idu-
allyintheﬁnal AT20G catalogue.
We searched two areas of sky deﬁned by the following
(J2000) coordinates:
SMC 00:30 < α <01:30−71◦< δ <−75◦
LMC 04:45 < α <06:00−66◦< δ <−72◦
There are six AT20G sources in the SMC region and 21 in the
LMCregion.AswithGalacticsources,some LMCandSMCradio
sources may have complex, extended emission which is not wel l
imagedbytheAT20Gsnapshotobservations.Insuchcases,th eﬂux
densities andpositions listedintheAT20G catalogue shoul d be re-
garded as no more than indicative. Hence one of the main reaso ns
for identifying LMC/SMC sources is to have the option of excl ud-
ingthem from later analysis of the extragalactic AT20G samp le.
To determine whether each 20 GHz source was likely to be
associated with the LMC or SMC we searched the NASA Ex-
tragalactic Database (NED)5for known LMC/SMC objects at or
near the AT20G position, and cross-matched the AT20G posi-
tions with lower-frequency radio catalogues from Filipovi ´ cet al.

6 COMPLETENESSAND RELIABILITY
The overall completeness of the AT20G catalogue is a functio n of
boththecompletenessoftheoriginalscanningsurvey,andt hecom-
pletenessofthefollow-upsurvey.Themethodsforestimati ngcom-
pletenessforbothsurveysarediscussedinthissection.In Section7
we compare our catalogue with the Wright etal. (2009) WMAP
catalogue toassess completeness and reliability.
6.1 Scanningsurveycompleteness
In order to estimate the completeness of the survey catalogu e (the
catalogue of candidate sources that was used as a basis for th e
follow-up observations) false point sources with known bri ght-
ness andpositions were insertedintothe timeordered uncal ibrated
scans. The false sources were injected by taking the primary cal-
ibrator observation, scaling it to the correct ﬂux and decli nation,
applyinganinversecalibrationappropriatetothetimeoft heobser-
vation,andaddingthistotherawdata.Thedatawasthenproc essed
using the same machinery that created the initial sky maps an d a
list of candidate sources including the injected sources we re then
detected. Finally, the extracted sources were compared to t he list
of input sources to measure the fraction of sources recovere d as a
functionofﬂuxdensity.Furtherdetailsofthisprocessare discussed
inHancock et al.(inpreparation).
This process allowed us to assess the completeness for point
sources. The AT20G survey is not sensitive to sources with an gu-
lar sizes much larger than 45′′and so our catalogue will be in-
complete for extremely extended sources. This brightness s ensi-
tivity limit means the AT20G survey can not detect the emissi on
from most nearby spiral galaxies, even those with integrate d ﬂux
densities above 100mJy at 20GHz. The nearby spiral NGC253
is detected as an extended AT20G source (J004733 −251717) with
a 20GHz ﬂux density of 608mJy, and in this case the observed
emission appears to arise from a central starburst rather th an
an AGN (see Tingay 2004; Brunthaler etal. 2009). At z=0.0008
(d=3.3Mpc),NGC253isthelowest-redshiftgalaxydetected inthe
AT20Gsurvey. Althoughseveral other spiralgalaxies are de tected,
including NGC1068 (J024240 −000046; z=0.0038), NGC4594
(J123959−113721; z=0.0036) and NGC4945 (J130527 −492804;
z=0.0019), the detectedradioemissioninthese galaxies ap pears to
be associated mainly with an active nucleus rather than proc esses
relatedtostarformation.
6.2 Follow-upsurvey completeness
Thecompletenessofthefollow-upsurveyisafunctionofthe com-
pleteness of the scanning survey catalogue, and of the numbe r of
objects that were scheduled and observed in follow-up mode. The
number of sources that we were able to observe was limited by
the ﬁnite length of the project and the weather conditions du ring
eachobserving run.The brightestsources ineachregionoft he sky
were observed ﬁrst so as to maximize the number of sources con -
ﬁrmedand thus conserve the completeness of the follow-up ob ser-
vations. Badweather andoccasional hardware malfunctions meant
that even though a source was scheduled for observation no go od
data was obtained. Much of this missing data was able to be re-
couped at a laterstage via cleanupobservations, but not all .Fig. 8 shows the source distribution for the AT20G follow-
up survey source catalogue. We calculated the follow-up sur vey

densities determined from the original scanning survey wer e accu-
rate to∼20per cent. Hence towards the ﬂux density cutoff there
is a reduction in completeness due to some sources being omit ted
from the original candidate lists.
For regions south of δ=−15◦we estimate the survey com-
pleteness to be 91 per cent above 100 mJy and 79 per cent above
50 mJy. The region −15◦< δ <0◦is notably less complete than
the restof the survey. This regionwas observed last,and was ham-

7 COMPARISONWITHTHE WMAP5-YEAR SOURCE
CATALOGUE
Foregroundpoint-source removal isanimportantstepinthe analy-
sis of CMB anisotropy data, since the strongest sources need to be
identiﬁed and masked out of the CMB images. The WMAP team
have therefore produced a catalogue of bright point sources in the
WMAPskymapsat23,33,41,61and94GHz(Wright etal.2009)
sothat these canbe masked out for CMBanalysis.
SincetheAT20Gsurveyoverlapsinfrequencywiththelowest
WMAP band (20–25 GHz), and the AT20G has signiﬁcantly bet-
ter sensitivity and resolution than the WMAP images, the AT2 0G
catalogue provides an independent check of the completenes s and
reliabilityof the WMAPpoint-source catalogues.
Massardi etal.(2009)haverecentlypublishedadetailedan al-
ysis which uses data from the AT20G Bright Source Sample
(Massardi et al. 2008) to evaluate several different strate gies for
foreground source detection in the WMAP 5-year maps. The re-
leaseofthefullAT20Gcataloguewillallowsimilarstudies topush
below the 0.5 Jy BSS limit and provide deeper complete sample s
for Planckandother CMB experiments.
A detailed comparison of the AT20G and WMAP source cat-
alogues is beyond the scope of this paper, so we focus here on
two questions: (i) what is the completeness and reliability of the
WMAP source catalogue? and (ii) how consistent are the AT20G
andWMAPﬂuxdensity scales at 20–25 GHz?
7.1 MatchingtheAT20G andWMAPsource catalogues
The WMAP 5-year source catalogue (Wrightet al. 2009) con-
tains 390 sources, of which 186 are in the southern hemispher e.
Wrightet al. (2009) note that the WMAP catalogue is expected to

be complete for sources stronger than 2 Jy in regions of the sk y
away from the Galactic plane, but also contains some sources with
ﬂuxdensities as low as 0.5Jyat 23GHz (WMAPK-band)6.
In matching the ﬁnal AT20G catalogue with the WMAP 5-
year source catalogue, we adopted the same 21.35arcmin cuto ff
radius usedbyMassardi etal.(2008) fortheAT20G BrightSou rce
Sample. 180 of the 186 southern sources in the WMAP cata-
logue were matched with at least one AT20G source within this
21.35arcminradius.Basedonourdeterminationofthesurfa ceden-
sity of bright AT20G sources, we expect all these matches to b e
genuine associations.
In 16 cases (i.e. 9 per cent of the WMAP source catalogue),
two or more AT20G sources make a signiﬁcant ( >10per cent)
contribution to the total ﬂux density in the 0.93◦WMAP beam at
23GHz. Some of these correspond toAT20G detections of sever al
components (e.g. core and hotspot, or twohotspots) of a sing le ex-
tended radio galaxy, while others appear to be unrelated pai rs of
sources.
6Wrightet al. (2009) note that sources with ﬂux densities bel ow 1 Jy are
unlikely to bedetected by WMAPunless they have ‘beneﬁted’ f rom apos-
itive noise or CMB ﬂuctuation. This in turn leads to a bias in t he WMAP
catalogue at low ﬂux densities (see, e.g. Eddington 1913;Ja uncey 1968).Fig. 9 shows the offsets between the AT20G and WMAP po-
sitions for sources incommon. Ingeneral these are consiste nt with
thequotedpositionerrors(typically ∼4arcminforWMAPandless
than 1arcsec for AT20G). As expected, the offsets are genera lly
smallerfor stronger WMAPsources.
7.2 Completenessand reliabilityof theWMAP5-year source
catalogue
A simple comparison of surface densities shows that the WMAP
and AT20G catalogues have similar levels of completeness fo r
strong (>1.0Jy) sources at 20–25 GHz. The surface density of
sources stronger than 1.0Jy is 28.5 ±2.2sr−1for AT20G and
26.8±1.7sr−1for the WMAP K-band, where the quoted errors
are set by the sample size in each case7. Since the WMAP sur-

face density at 23GHz is 94 per cent of the AT20G value, and
the AT20G catalogue is essentially complete for point sourc es
strong than 1Jy, we estimate that the WMAP catalogue is rough ly
94 per cent complete above 1Jy at 23GHz. Excluding the area
masked in the WMAP source catalogue, we ﬁnd only one strong
(>1.5Jy) AT20G source which is not listed in the WMAP cata-
logue, AT20G J142432 −491349.
Appendix A lists the eight sources in the WMAP catalogue
which have no AT20G match stronger than 250mJy within 21.35
arcmin of the WMAP position. Three of these (the radio galaxy
Fornax A, a Galactic HII region and the Galactic planetary ne b-
ulaNGC7293) arehighly-extendedsourceswhichareresolve dout
by the 2arcmin ATCA beam, and so represent an incompleteness
in the AT20G sample. Two sources are found in both surveys but
with a very large position offset, and three sources catalog ued by

general,however,thereisverygoodagreementbetweentheA T20G
and WMAP source catalogues. Since the AT20G catalogue is es-
sentially 100% reliable, and ∼98% of 23GHz WMAP sources are
matchedinAT20G,weconcludethatthe23GHzWMAPcatalogue
is∼98% reliable.

The rms scatter of the individual ﬂuxes is 0.31. The main cont ri-
bution to the standard deviation in the ﬂux ratios probably c omes
from variability, since the AT20G and WMAP measurements are
generally not simultaneous. The typical uncertainty in the individ-
ualWMAPandAT20Gﬂuxdensitymeasurementsis 4−5percent.
Since the formal standard error on the mean ﬂuxratio is 0.028 , we
conclude that the AT20G and WMAP ﬂux density scales are con-
sistenttowithin2–3 per cent at20–25 GHz.
8 ANALYSIS
8.1 Polarisation
To test the robustness of our polarization measurements we u sed
the variability sample (see Section 2.5), selecting a set of 142 ob-
jects which had good quality observations in our 2004 Octobe r,
2005 October and 2006 April observing epochs. Fig. 11 shows t he

Fig. 12 shows the 20 GHz polarised intensity versus the total
ﬂux density for variability sample sources observed in 2005 Octo-
ber. The dashed horizontal line shows a 6 mJy limit in polaris ed
ﬂux, a level 3–4 times the typical error in polarised ﬂux. Mos t of
the limits (triangles) fall below this line, and so it was cho sen as a
reasonable level at which the polarised ﬂux density can be re liably

further investigation, as it raises the possibility that so me AT20G
sources may be genuinely variable inpolarizedﬂux.
We found a good correlation between the fractional polarisa -
tion measured at 5 GHz and 8 GHz, and also a reasonable corre-
lation between the fractional polarisation measured at 5 GH z and
20 GHz, although the large scatter in the latter case suggest s there
may be some change in the polarisation properties of the sour ces
across the wider frequency range. There was also reasonable con-
sistency in polarised position angles measured at each of th e three
frequencies. This will be analysed in more detail inMassard i et al.
(inpreparation).

that we have relatively homogeneous coverage of the souther n sky
down to 100 mJy. At a 50 mJy cutoff we have regions of incom-
pleteness (notably 0◦to−15◦and−30◦to−50◦) as discussed in
Section 6. This is primarily due to bad weather in the follow- up
runs.
Fig. 14 shows a plot of the AT20G differential source counts
(log(N)−log(S)). These are well ﬁt by a power law ( f(x) =
31x−2.15) down to ∼100mJy where the ﬂattening of the curve is
a sign that the catalogue is becoming incomplete at this leve l. This
agrees with our analysis in Section 6. Note that the source co unts
presented here are not corrected for completeness — this wil l be
explored further inMassardi et al.,(inpreparation).
8.3 Spectralindexdistribution

spectral index:

which the effects of spectral curvature can be ignored, whic h is
clearly not the case for the AT20G sample. Hence for our analy -
sisitismore appropriate touse aradiocolour-colour diagr am (e.g.
Kesteven etal. 1977; Sadler etal. 2006). Fig. 15 shows a colo ur-
colour plot for the 3763 AT20G sources with near-simultaneo us
data at 5, 8 and 20GHz. The plot compares the lower frequency
spectral index α(5,8)with the higher frequency spectral index
α(8,20).
AsnotedpreviouslybySadler etal.(2006)andMassardi et al .
(2008) this plot shows a wide range of spectral types at 20 GHz .
Four maintypes can be identiﬁed:
(i) Sources with steep (falling) spectra, which are shown in the
lower left quadrant. These represent ∼57per cent of the sample
and include a higher fractionof power law spectra.
(ii) Sources withpeaked (GPS)spectra, which rise atlower f re-
quencies and fall at higher frequencies. These are shown in t he
lower right quadrant andrepresent ∼21per cent of the sample.
(iii) Sources with inverted (rising) spectra, which are sho wn in
the upper right quadrant. These make up ∼14per cent of sources.
(iv) Sources with an upturn in their spectra, shown in the upp er
leftquadrant. These represent ∼8per cent of the sample.

We have also identiﬁed a new class of sources with ultra-
inverted spectra ( α(5,20)>+0.7). These are shown as open cir-

The 40mJy cutoff of the AT20G catalogue is an order of magni-
tude brighter than the NVSS and SUMSS/MGPS-2 completeness
limits (which are typically 2.5–10mJy, depending on declin ation),
sowe expect thevast majorityofAT20G sources tohave anNVSS
or SUMSS match within 10–15arcsec on the sky. AT20G sources
without a counterpart in the NVSS and SUMSS catalogues must
have either a sharply–rising radio spectrum (with α >+0.5) or
highlyvariable radioemission.

Allthesources inTable 7have (non-simultaneous) 1–20GHz

these extreme spectral indices are the result of source vari ability
between the NVSS/SUMSS and AT20G observing epochs. This
does not generally appear to be the case. The sources in Table 7
are also among the most extreme AT20G objects in terms of thei r
(simultaneous) 5–20 GHz spectral index, with a median value of
α(5,20) = +0 .68(the median α(5,20)for the AT20G sample
as a whole is −0.22). In all but two cases (J032945 −485420 and

radio spectrum between 1 and 20 GHz and little or no variabili ty
ontimescales of up toa decade.
By analogy with the Ultra–Steep spectrum (USS) radio
sources with α <−1.3(Blumenthal &Miley 1979; Tielens et al.
1979) we introduce the term “Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) radio
source” to describe the class of radio sources witha spectra l index
α(5,20)>+0.7.
The AT20G catalogue contains 45 sources with α(5,20)>
+0.7(roughly1.2%oftheAT20Gsourceswith5and8GHzdata),
and these are listedin Table 8. A few of these sources are dete cted
in linear polarization, conﬁrming that the emission mechan ism is
non-thermal, so we assume for now that all the AT20G UIS ob-
jectsareextragalacticnon-thermal sources.Furtherinve stigationis
needed to conﬁrm this, but we note that the UIS sources have th e
same distribution in Galactic latitude as the main AT20G sam ple
and show noconcentration towards the Galactic plane.
Fig.16compares the AT20Gsources inTable7withthesam-
ple of High Frequency Peakers (HFPs) studied by Dallacasa et al.
(2000), who measured simultaneous ﬂux densities at several fre-
quencies between 1.4 and 22.5 GHz for a sample of 55 sources
selectedtohaveinvertedspectrawith α(1,5)>+0.5.OurAT20G
UIS sources with α(5,20)>+0.7have radio spectra which
rise more rapidly with frequency than any of the HFP sample. I f
the AT20G UIS sources peak at frequencies near or above above
20 GHz, the O’Dea (1998) relation between spectral peak and
source size implies that these are expected to be very young, com-
pact radiosources less thana few tens of parsecs insize.

Optical counterparts of the full AT20G sample were found by
cross-matchingthe radiopositions withopticalpositions intheSu-
perCOSMOSdatabase(Hamblyet al.2001).AT20Gobjectswith in
10◦of the Galactic plane were excluded from this analysis due to
thepresence offoreground stars andGalacticdust extincti on,leav-
ing a total of 4932 objects used in this analysis. Optical ide ntiﬁ-
cations were chosen to be the closest optical source to the ra dio
positionwithina2.5arcsec radiusandbrighter thanaBmagn itude
of 22, which is the SuperCOSMOS completeness limit. Previou s

studies have found that 97 per cent of sources selected in thi s way
are likelytobe genuine associations (Sadler etal.2006).
Using this selection method there are 2958 AT20G sources
(60 per cent) with optical identiﬁcations, the majority of w hich
are QSOs. This is much higher than seen in low frequency ra-
dio surveys which typically have an optical identiﬁcation r ate of
25−30 per cent. This again highlights the signiﬁcant differenc e of
the AT20G source population from other radioselected AGNsa m-
ples. Full analysis of the optical properties of these objec ts will be
published separately (Mahony et al.inpreparation)
9 CONCLUSIONSANDFUTUREWORK
We present a catalogue of 5890 sources from the Australia Tel e-
scope 20 GHz survey, the deepest large-area survey at high ra dio
frequency. For 3766 of these sources we have near-simultane ous
5 and 8 GHz measurements, and 1559 sources have a detection in
polarized totalintensityat one or more of the three frequen cies.
The 20 GHz ﬂux densities measured for the strongest AT20G
sources are in excellent agreement with the WMAP 5-year sour ce
catalogue recently published by Wrightet al. (2009), and we ﬁnd
that the WMAP source catalogue is close to complete (and high ly
reliable) forsources stronger than1.5Jyat 23GHz.
We identify a population of Ultra-Inverted Spectrum radio
sources with a spectral index of α(5,20)>+0.7. These are rare
sources,comprisingroughly1.2percentoftheAT20Gpopula tion.

AT20G CATALOGUE
Table A1 lists the eight WMAP sources that do not have a cata-
logued bright ( >250mJy) AT20G source within 21.35arcmin of
the WMAP position. These ‘missing’ sources fall into severa l cat-
egories whichare discussed inthe following sections.
A1 Brightnearbyradiogalaxies withlarge angular size
As noted by Massardi etal. (2008), the radio galaxy Fornax A
(WMAP J0322 −3711) is not detected in the AT20G survey be-
cause most of its 20 GHz ﬂux density arises from diffuse emiss ion
associated with the lobes, which are resolved out by the 2arc min
ATCA beam. Fornax A is the only bright extragalactic source
known tobe missingfrom the AT20G catalogue.
Two other WMAP sources (J0133 −3627 and J0636 −2031)
correspond to peaks in the extended emission of the nearby ra dio
galaxies NGC612 and PKS0634 −20 respectively. Both these
galaxies are detected by AT20G, and the large WMAP–AT20G
position offsets arise from the complex structure of the ext ended
radioemission.
A2 ExtendedGalactic sources
Two WMAP objects (J0519 −0539 and J2229 −2050) are as-
sociated with extended Galactic sources. Wrightet al. (200 9)
note that J0519 −0539 is a blend of two Lynds Bright Nebulae,
LBN207.65 −23.11 and LBN207.29 −22.66, while J0636 −2031
is part of the Helix Nebula, NGC7293. Both objects are signif -
icantly larger than the AT20G beam, and appear to be mostly
resolvedout inour survey.
A3 Extragalactic WMAPsources not foundinAT20G
There are three remaining WMAP sources (J0632 −6928,
J1150−7927 and J1637 −7714) for which no obvious counterpart
can be found in the AT20G catalogue. All three of these source s
aredetectedineachofthe ﬁveWMAPsingle-year images (Wrig ht
et al. 2009), and do not appear to vary signiﬁcantly in ﬂux den sity
over this ﬁve-year timespan.
In two cases (WMAP J0632 −6928 and J1150 −7927), there
is no catalogued AT20G source within the 0.9◦WMAP beam at
the listed WMAP position. Unless these WMAP sources are very
diffuse, itseems unlikely that theyare real.
J0632-6928 has a WMAP ﬂux density of 0.4Jy, making it
the weakest K-band (23GHz) detection in the Wright et al. (20 09)
catalogue, but it is detected (as a sub-Jy source) in all 5 WMA P
bands. The closest AT20G source, J063455-694532, is 0.4deg
away and has a ﬂux density of 66mJybeam−1at 20GHz and
154mJybeam−1at 5GHz. Its PMN counterpart is PMN J0634-
6945 with a ﬂux density of 92 ±8mJybeam−1, and the SUMSS
ﬂux density is 123.1 ±3.8mJybeam−1. AT20G J063455-694532
seems too faint to be a plausible identiﬁcation for the WMAP
source.
The third source (WMAP J1637 −7714) is identi-
ﬁed by Wrightet al. (2009) with a nearby 5 GHz source
PMN J1636 −7713, which is also detected as a weak
(40±2mJybeam−1at 20 GHz) AT20G source. Once again,
c/circlecopyrt2008 RAS, MNRAS 000,1–??AT20G SourceCatalogue 19
however, the catalogued AT20G ﬂux density is well be-
low the WMAP detection limit. A stronger AT20G source
(AT20G J164416 −771548, with a 20 GHz ﬂux density of
399±20mJybeam−1) lies 22arcmin from the WMAP position,
and maybe responsible for the WMAPdetection.
