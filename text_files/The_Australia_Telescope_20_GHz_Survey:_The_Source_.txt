ABSTRACT We present the full source catalogue from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) Survey. The AT20G is a blind radio survey carried out at 20 GHz with the Australia Telescope Com- pact Array (ATCA) from 2004 to 2008, and covers the whole sky south of declination 0◦. The AT20G source catalogue presented here is an order of magnitude larger than any previ- ous catalogue of high-frequency radio sources, and includes 5890 sources above a 20 GHz ﬂux-density limit of 40 mJy. All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarisation mea- sured at 20 GHz, and most sources south of declination −15◦ also have near-simultaneous ﬂux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz. A total of 1559 sources were detected in polarised total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies.

The completeness of the AT20G source catalogue is 91 per cent above 100 mJy beam−1 and 79 per cent above 50 mJy beam−1 in regions south of declination −15◦. North of −15◦, some observations of sources between 14 − 20 hr in right ascension were lost due to bad weather and could not be repeated, so the catalogue completeness is lower in this region. Each detected source was visually inspected as part of our quality control process, and so the reliability of the ﬁnal catalogue is essentially 100 per cent.

We detect a small but signiﬁcant population of non-thermal sources that are either un- detected or have only weak detections in low-frequency catalogues. We introduce the term Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) to describe these radio sources, which have a spectral index α(5, 20) > +0.7 and which constitute roughly 1.2 per cent of the AT20G sample.

The 20 GHz ﬂux densities measured for the strongest AT20G sources are in excellent agreement with the WMAP 5-year source catalogue of Wright et al. (2009), and we ﬁnd that the WMAP source catalogue is close to complete for sources stronger than 1.5 Jy at 23 GHz.

Large-area high-frequency radio surveys are time-consuming, and as a result relatively few large scale surveys have been carried out.

2 Murphy et al.

Those that have been completed are either deep but covering small areas, or shallow all-sky surveys. As a result, our knowledge of the high frequency (> 10 GHz) radio source population is poor.

In addition to the scientiﬁc beneﬁts of studying the radio source population at high frequencies, large scale surveys are use- ful for foreground subtraction for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. Measurement of CMB anisotropies is lim- ited by contamination from astronomical foregrounds, both Galac- tic and extragalactic. To improve the efﬁciency of the component separation techniques, observations such as those of ESA’s Planck mission are performed on a broad spectral region ranging from a 100 GHz, few tenths to hundreds of GHz. At frequencies up to extragalactic radio sources are the major contaminants on angular scales smaller than 30 arcminutes (de Zotti et al. 2005), so identiﬁ- cation of radio sources at high frequencies is critical.

The ﬁrst blind radio survey above 8 GHz was carried out by Taylor et al. (2001) with the Ryle telescope at 15.2 GHz. The sur- vey covered a 63 deg2 region and detected 66 sources to a limiting ﬂux density of 20 mJy. Waldram et al. (2003) extended the survey to 520 deg2, detecting 465 sources to a ﬂux density limit of 25 mJy (the 9C survey). Both surveys found that the existence and ﬂux density of sources at 15 GHz cannot be accurately predicted by ex- trapolation from lower frequency radio surveys such as the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) at 1.4 GHz (Condon et al. 1998), further demonstrating the need for large scale high frequency surveys for population characterisation and source subtraction in CMB studies. The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sur- vey, which covers the whole sky at 23, 33, 41, 61 and 94 GHz (Bennett et al. 2003), is the ﬁrst all-sky radio survey above 5 GHz. The WMAP Point Source Catalogue constructed from the 5 yr maps contains 390 sources (Wright et al. 2009), compared to 323 and 208 sources found in the previous 3 yr and 1 yr maps re- spectively (Bennett et al. 2003; Hinshaw et al. 2007). Recently, Massardi et al. (2009) have detected 516 sources in the 5 yr WMAP maps by exploiting a combination of blind and non-blind detection approaches. Section 7 presents a detailed comparison of our AT20G results with the 5 yr WMAP point-source catalogue.

Table 1 summarises some earlier large-area high-frequency radio surveys, showing the context in which the AT20G survey was designed. A pilot survey for the AT20G at 18.5 GHz was carried out in 2002 and 2003 with the Australia Telescope Com- pact Array (ATCA) (Ricci et al. 2004; Sadler et al. 2006) and de- tected 173 sources stronger than 100 mJy in the declination range ◦. Ricci et al. (2004) conﬁrmed that ATCA (with cus- − tom hardware) had the capability to rapidly survey the sky at high frequencies. The differential source counts for extragalactic sources from the pilot survey were found to be in good agreement with the Waldram et al. (2003) 15 GHz survey.

In this paper we present the full catalogue from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz Survey (AT20G). The survey covers 20,086 square degrees (the complete Southern sky to declination 0◦) to a limiting ﬂux density of 40 mJy beam−1. We followed up candi- date sources detected in the survey at 20 GHz and also have near- simultaneous follow-up observations at 5 and 8 GHz for AT20G ◦. An accompanying paper (Mas- sources south of declination sardi et al., in preparation) will provide more detailed statisti- cal analysis of the AT20G sample. A subset of the 320 brightest ◦) AT20G sources were pre- (S20 > 0.5 Jy) extragalactic ( sented and discussed by Massardi et al. (2008). The Galactic plane was included in our scanning survey but no follow-up observations ◦, except for a blind survey of optically were carried out at < 1.5 thick compact HII regions (Murphy et al. 2009).

In Section 2 we describe the survey and follow-up observa- tions, and in Section 3 we describe the data reduction process. In Section 4 we calculate the accuracy of our measured positions and ﬂux densities. Section 5 presents the source catalogue and deﬁnes its format, with the completeness and reliability of the catalogue discussed in Section 6. As an additional investigation into the com- pleteness, Section 7 compares our catalogue with the 5 yr WMAP results. Finally, Section 8 discusses some statistical properties of the sample and Section 9 presents our conclusions.

2 OBSERVATIONS

The key feature of the AT20G is a two-phase observing strategy. The ﬁrst phase of our observations exploited the fast scanning capa- bility of ATCA, using a wideband analogue correlator, to carry out a blind survey. Candidate sources from the scanning survey were then observed in the regular snapshot mode of the ATCA. The re- sults from the scanning survey, which is complete to a deeper level but has lower reliability, will be presented in a companion paper (Hancock et al., in preparation).

2.1 Survey mode

The ﬁrst phase of our observations consisted of a raster of blind scans of the entire southern sky at 20 GHz, using the ATCA in fast scanning mode (in which it can achieve a speed of 15 degrees min−1 in declination at the meridian). The ATCA has low noise very wideband receiver1 (Moorey et al. 2008) which was used to- gether with a custom analogue correlator. The correlator has 8 GHz bandwidth (Roberts, in preparation) and was originally developed as part of the collaboration for the Taiwanese CMB experiment AMiBA (Lo et al. 2001). We used it to take dual orthogonal po- larization data from three of the six 22 m dishes of the ATCA. The lag-correlator measured 16 visibilities as a function of differential delay for each of the three antenna pairs used.

Our custom correlator had no mechanism for allowing for ge- ometrical delay as a function of the position in the sky, so the scans had to be performed along the meridian corresponding to zero delay for the East-West conﬁguration ATCA. All the survey observations used antennas 2, 3, and 4, situated on stations W102, W104, and W106, giving two 30.6 m (2 4) baselines and a single − 4) baseline. The shortest baseline of 30.6 m means the 61.2 m (2 survey has reduced sensitivity to extended sources (a 50 per cent ′′). Larger sources will reduction in amplitude for source size > 45 only be included in the survey if they have ﬂux density in smaller angular size cores or hot spots above the survey limit.

The scanning strategy consisted of sweeping sky regions 10◦ or 15◦ wide in declination and using Earth rotation to cover the full 24 hour right ascension range in a zig-zag pattern. To achieve Nyquist sky coverage we used multiple zig-zag scanning paths over multiple days – each day the scanning path was shifted by half a beam width. Along the scan a sample was collected every 54 ms (3 samples per beam), which resulted in an rms noise of 12 mJy. Poor quality scans (due to weather or equipment error) were re- peated, so that the sky coverage is as uniform as possible. The ana- logue correlator outputs for each set of 24 hour observations (in- terleaves) were combined together and calibrated to produce maps

The initial calibration of the interleaves was achieved by a daily transit observation of a nearby known calibrator. A second round of calibration was based on those sources from the ATCA calibrator catalogue2 that fell within each of the interleave obser- vations. Typically there were about 10 such sources within each 24 hour observation. A third and ﬁnal round of calibration was done using newly detected strong sources within the map itself.

The delay steps in the analogue correlator were not precisely equal (as they are in a digital correlator) so the spectrum is not quite the same as the Fourier transform of the lags. Hence standard synthesis techniques using discrete Fourier transforms could not be used for reliable source detection. Furthermore the poor (u, v) coverage of the survey (30 and 60 m EW spacings only) required a custom source detection program that worked in a CLEAN-like fashion, detecting the strongest source, ﬁtting a template dirty beam and recording its location and ﬂux estimate before moving to the 50 mJy beam−1) were next source.

survey are accurate to 20 per cent (see Hancock et al., in prepa- ration) and so we expected a fraction of the sources to fall below our speciﬁed survey detection threshold when re-observed.

∼

The follow-up observations were scheduled to be as close as practical (typically within a few weeks) to the initial survey obser- vations for a particular declination band, to reduce the effects of source variability on survey completeness. Table 3 lists the details of each follow-up run, including the shortest antenna spacing and resolution at each frequency.

The 20 GHz follow-up observations were performed using a hybrid array conﬁguration (i.e., one in which there were North- South as well as East-West baselines) with the standard ATCA dig- ital correlator. We used two 128 MHz bands centred at 18 752 MHz and 21 056 MHz and two polarisations. During data processing the two bands were combined to form a single 256 MHz wide band centered at 19 904 MHz which is the reference frequency for our 20 GHz observations.

Each of the candidate sources identiﬁed in the ﬁrst phase of obser- vations was observed in the regular snapshot mode of the ATCA to conﬁrm the detection and to measure an accurate position, ﬂux density and polarisation. The ﬂux densities from the initial scan

Candidate sources were prioritised for follow-up observations in order of decreasing ﬂux density to minimise problems with sam- ple completeness. The sources were scheduled in blocks of 20 ∼ targets, with a nearby secondary calibrator observed for 5 min- utes at the beginning and end of each block. The sources within each block were observed in the fast mosaicing mode of the ATCA to reduce the slew time between pointings. We aimed to get two

each 20 GHz observing run was fol- lowed by lower frequency observations of the same sets of sources. In these runs we used an East-West extended array conﬁguration, with two 128 MHz bands centred at 4 800 MHz and 8 640 MHz. For the rest of this paper, these frequencies will be referred to as ‘5’ and ‘8’ GHz. The lower frequency observations were conducted within a couple of weeks of the 20 GHz observations, so as to ob- tain near simultaneous spectral data for our sample. Sources in the 15◦) were not observed at 5 most northern declination band (δ > and 8 GHz because of the poor (u, v) coverage of EW arrays near the equator. We completed several extra observing runs, at both 20 and 5/8 GHz for the purposes of replacing bad quality data from pre- vious runs. Table 3 lists the details of our observing runs, with the ﬁrst column showing the matching high frequency-lower frequency epochs. The primary beam FWHM of the ATCA is 2.4, 5.5, and 9.9 arcmin at 20, 8, and 5 GHz, respectively.

2.3 Additional Observations

In addition to the main survey described in this paper, we have com- pleted several complementary sets of observations which will be presented in accompanying papers. In October 2006 we observed a sub-sample of the bright sources to obtain high sensitivity polari- sation measurements (Burke-Spolaor et al. in preparation). These observations used the most compact conﬁguration of the ATCA (H75), which provides the best coverage of a range of short spac- ings, and longer integration times than for the main survey, so that higher quality images could be made.

Nine highly extended sources were selected from low fre- quency catalogues – PMN at 4.85 GHz (Grifﬁth & Wright 1993) and SUMSS at 843 MHz (Mauch et al. 2003) – and observed in mosaic mode to improve the ﬂux density estimation at 20 GHz (Burke-Spolaor et al. 2009). Data for seven of these sources have been incorporated into our catalogue in order to avoid ﬂux density underestimation due to resolution effects. However, since we do not have equivalent 5 and 8 GHz observations of these objects we cannot use these data for analyses of radio spectra.

During the AT20G follow-up survey, the 6 km antenna of the ATCA was operational for most of the observing time, however the data from the ﬁve much longer baselines could not be easily included in our standard processing pipeline. As a separate pro- gram, we estimated the 6 km visibility by taking the ratio of the scalar amplitude at the 6 km baseline to the scalar amplitude at shorter baselines. This removes the effect of atmospheric decorre- lation and avoids the need to phase calibrate the long baselines. Approximately 90 per cent of the AT20G sources have 6 km data available. These 6 km visibilities allows us to identify sources that appear point-like in the compact conﬁguration, but extended on the 0.3 arcsec scale corresponding to the 6 km baselines. The full anal- ysis and results from this high resolution follow-up will be pre- sented in Chhetri et al. (in preparation). An immediate application of this data was the identiﬁcation of extended ﬂat spectrum sources which are either thermal, or compact non-thermal sources extended by gravitational lensing. Gravitational lens candidates are being observed with ATCA 6 km conﬁgurations at 7 mm. The thermal sources identiﬁed by this procedure are Galactic objects, mainly

planetary nebulae. They are ﬂagged as Galactic in the main cata- logue – see Section 5.4.

2.4 Galactic Plane Follow-up

Neither the scanning survey nor the follow-up observations were well suited to imaging diffuse Galactic sources. We decided to ex- ◦ from our main follow-up survey clude sources within and instead follow up selected subsamples of these sources with targeted observing runs. The ﬁrst of these was the follow-up of a sample of ultra- and hyper-compact HII regions, selected on the basis of their rising spectral index between 843 MHz (from the 2nd Epoch Molonglo Galactic Plane Survey (Murphy et al. 2007)) and 20 GHz (α(0.843, 20) > 0.1). Further information is given in Murphy et al. (2009).

2.5 Variability Sample

Many large-area radio continuum surveys have been conducted at frequencies of 1.4 GHz or below, where the long-term variability of most radio sources is low. As a result, the source catalogues from these surveys can continue to be used with a high level of conﬁdence for many years after the survey was made. This is not necessarily true for surveys at frequencies above 5 GHz, where the source population is increasingly dominated by ﬂat-spectrum radio sources which are expected to be variable (e.g. Condon et al. 1989). To study the variability of the 20 GHz radio-source population on timescales of years, we re-observed a sample of 170 sources (at ◦ and with 20 GHz ﬂux densities above declination 100 mJy) at several epochs over the course of the AT20G survey. All the sources in this variability sample were originally detected in the AT20G Pilot Survey in 2002–2003 (Ricci et al. 2004), giving up to ﬁve epochs of observation for some of these sources.

The early (2002–2004) 20 GHz data for the variability sample are discussed by Sadler et al. (2006), who conclude that the general level of variability in sources selected at 20 GHz is relatively low on timescales of 1 2 years, with a median variability index of 6.9 per cent at 20 GHz over a one-year time interval. We therefore expect the AT20G catalogue presented here to be reasonably stable, in the sense that if we were to reobserve the survey area on timescales of a few years, would expect the new source catalogue to contain most of the same sources as the old one.

−

The AT20G catalogue presented in this paper only lists a sin- gle epoch for sources in the variability sample (typically the 2004 observation, except in cases of poor-quality data). A separate pa- per (Sadler et al., in preparation) will present a full catalogue and detailed analysis of the AT20G variability sample.

3 DATA REDUCTION

We developed a fully automated custom analysis pipeline to edit, calibrate, and image the data from the follow-up observations. This included a suite of quality control routines to ensure consistent data quality in the ﬁnal catalogue. The software was developed using the scripting language Python, and the data reduction was done with the aperture synthesis reduction package Miriad (Sault et al. 1995). The data reduction was followed by a cataloguing stage in which the best quality sources were selected for the ﬁnal cata- logue. This stage also included manual quality control, in which all sources included in the ﬁnal catalogue were inspected by sev- eral AT20G team members (EM, EMS, JAE, RDE, TM). In the rest

3.1 Flagging poor quality data

Weather conditions can seriously affect the quality of the high- frequency data. Attenuation of the signal by atmospheric water vapour can decrease the sensitivity of the observations, and atmo- spheric turbulence can produce phase ﬂuctuations that may produce visibility amplitude decorrelation. Hence data collected in periods of bad weather were removed before further processing. In partic- ular, calibrator data must be of high quality otherwise it introduces errors in the calibration solutions that affect the whole dataset.

densities across the whole run, excluding snapshots which had a ﬂux density greater than two standard deviations away from the mean. Each target source was then calibrated using the secondary calibrator associated with its observing block.

An atmospheric seeing monitoring system operates at the ATCA site. This measures the differential phase variations in a geo- stationary satellite signal caused by tropospheric water vapour ﬂuc- tuations (as described in Middelberg et al. 2006). We used this data, in conjunction with the system temperature measurements from the antenna receivers (to estimate tropospheric opacity) to develop semi-automatic ﬂagging criteria. Speciﬁcally, we discarded data from all the periods in which there was decorrelation greater than 10 per cent. In cases where a calibrator was excluded, the block of target sources associated with that calibrator was also excluded.

In a majority of epochs less than a few per cent of the data was ﬂagged. Very occasionally, bad weather required large blocks of data in the follow-up survey to be edited out. Most of the time we were able to reobserve these blocks in clean-up runs. However, in ◦ there are several regions between the declination band 14 hr and 20 hr in right ascension which are still incomplete.

Our observation strategy meant that we had insufﬁcient data to determine the instrumental polarisation corrections from the sec- ondary calibrators. Hence we calculated the leakage terms using the primary calibrator, PKS B1934 638. The linear polarisation of this calibrator is known to be not variable and less than 0.2 per cent of the total source ﬂux density at each of our observing frequen- cies. To determine the leakage terms it was assumed to be unpo- larised. We adopted these leakage values for all the secondary cal- ibrators, simultaneously calculating the time-dependent complex antenna gains, the residual xy phase differences (x and y are the orthogonal linear polarisations), and the Q and U Stokes parame- ters of the calibrators. The polarisation calibration was then applied to the target sources and I, Q, U and V Stokes parameters were de- termined for all of the target sources.

3.2 Calibration

Primary ﬂux calibration and bandpass calibration were done in the standard way using PKS B1934 638, with the assumed ﬂuxes shown in Table 4. More information about the ATCA ﬂux scale at 20 GHz is given in Sault (2003).

−

For the secondary ﬂux calibration we followed a non-standard procedure which is summarised in Fig. 3. In each epoch of our observations we typically observed around 50 secondary cali- brators. To calculate an accurate ﬂux density for each secondary calibrator we calculated the mean of the individual snapshot ﬂux

and its phase is the closure phase. Compared to measuring the ﬂux densities from images, as is typical, this method of measuring ﬂux densities is robust to the effects of phase decorrelation (Ricci et al., in preparation). This meant that we were able to recover ﬂux

3.3.2 Extended source ﬂuxes

Sources that are partially resolved, or have multiple components, are not well-characterised by the triple product ﬂux measurement. We identiﬁed extended sources in our sample using several criteria based on the ratio of the triple product ﬂux density to the ﬂux den- sity measured on the shortest baseline. We visually inspected the 20 GHz visibilities and images for each of these sources, to con- ﬁrm a sample of 337 extended sources. Fig. 4 shows an example of a typical AT20G extended source.

For the extended sources, we calculated the integrated ﬂux densities at 5, 8 and 20 GHz using the amplitude of the signal mea- sured by the shortest baseline. Any source extended at 20 GHz was assumed to be extended at 5 and 8 GHz. In most cases the shortest physical baseline used in the follow-up observations is either 60 m or 80 m (see Table 3), so our 20 GHz ﬂux densities for sources larger than 20 arcsec will still be underestimated using this method. Although improved algorithms could be used, the snapshot obser- vations are inadequate to make reliable estimates. The extended sources will be discussed in more detail in a future paper. Note that the H75 array observations used for epoch 7 have closest spacing of 30 m so the short spacing ﬂux estimate is good for sources up to about 1 arcmin.

For extended sources with multiple components larger than 40 arcsec, the shortest spacing can correspond to a minimum in the visibility and is not a useful estimate of total ﬂux. For these sources we quote the triple product ﬂux density that would correspond to

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

the ﬂux density of the dominant component and ﬂag the ﬂux as ‘poor’ in the source catalogue.

Nine of the extremely extended sources were observed separately and we have used the ﬂux densities determined in Burke-Spolaor et al. (2009) for seven of them. These are discussed in Section 5.1.

3.4 Imaging

We imaged all sources using the standard Miriad process, and de- convolved them with a small number of CLEAN iterations (typi- cally 50). This was done primarily for the purpose of visual inspec- tion, since all ﬂux densities were determined using the triple prod- uct as discussed in the previous section. Fig. 4 shows examples of 353034, and a typical ex- a typical point source, AT20G J004441 tended source, AT20G J110622 210858, at all three frequencies plus the total polarized intensity.

−

3.5 Polarisation

Polarization maps in the four Stokes parameters were created using the Miriad routine IMPOL. The total polarized intensity (P ) for each source was measured by calculating the fractional polarization (m) in the image at the position of the source, and multiplying it by the ﬂux density calculated using the triple product. The error on the polarized ﬂux was calculated using

Perr = √2

σn χ

where σn is the error associated with the noise, which was calcu- lated from the rms noise measured in the Stokes V image, and χ is ratio of the ﬂux density in the Stokes I image to the ﬂux density as calculated from the triple product. This corrects for phase decorre- lation, which would affect both polarized and total ﬂux density in the same way.

The polarised ﬂux was measured at the position of the peak in the Stokes I image. This will be equivalent to the integrated po- larization for the unresolved sources but will be neither the peak nor the integrated polarization for the extended sources. For the seven extremely extended sources discussed in Section 5.1 we have used the integrated polarization determined by Burke-Spolaor et al. (2009).

We used the sources observed multiple times as part of the variability sample to investigate the reproducibility of our polarisa- tion measurements (see Section 8.1). Based on these experiments we developed the following rules for deﬁning a detection

• •

if P 6 3Perr then P = 3Perr as a limit if m 6 1% then P = 0.01S20 as a limit if P 6 6 mJy then P = 6 mJy as a limit

where P is the total polarized intensity and m is the fractional po- larization. If no polarization detection was made, then the limit on the polarized ﬂux density is the maximum of these three limits.

3.6 Cataloguing

All good quality observations were selected for the ﬁnal source cat- alogue. In cases where a source was observed in multiple epochs (usually due to there being a poor quality observation in the ear- lier epoch) we selected the best source based on the data quality, the presence of near-simultaneous 5/8 GHz data and the offset of the source from the imaging pointing centre. For sources that were

observed multiple times as part of the variability study, we selected the ﬁrst epoch of observation except in cases where that observation was of poor quality.

Due to the poor (u, v) coverage of the scanning survey, a small percentage of the sources scheduled for follow-up observa- tions were in fact sidelobes of the main source. Fig. 5 shows a typical AT20G source as detected in the images created from the scanning survey. The scanning survey has only two different base- lines (EW 30 m and 60 m) so the images have very high sidelobes. In some cases bright sidelobes were inadvertently followed-up. We excluded sidelobes automatically by grouping all ‘duplicate’ sources within a radius of 100 arcsec (the effective beam size of the scanning survey) and ﬁltering to keep only the strongest source in the group. Cross-matching with low frequency surveys also helped to conﬁrm these selections.

All sources were then inspected by several members of the AT20G team, using an online annotation tool. We used this as a ﬁnal quality control procedure, and to identify any remaining side- lobes. We also used this process to identify extended sources that were not classiﬁed by our automatic selection criteria.

where σcal is the error associated with calibration, and σn is the error associated with the noise.

The calibration term was estimated by comparison with the the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) deﬁning calibra- tors (Fey et al. 2004). The VLBI-measured positions in the ICRF catalogue are accurate to a milliarcsecond or below, so any dis- crepancy between the positions of our target sources and ICRF positions can be assumed to be due to calibration positional er- rors in our sample. There are 251 ICRF calibrators in our sample, and the positional offsets for these are shown in Fig. 6. The mean offsets in right ascension and declination are = 0.1 arcsec = 0.0 arcsec, showing we are in good agreement with and

The gain error is a multiplicative term (i.e., it is proportional to the source ﬂux density) and is a measure of the gain stability over time. We estimated σgain for each observational epoch and frequency from the scatter in the visibility amplitudes of the cali- brators in each observing run. The mean values for the gain errors were found to be of order a few per cent. The noise term is an addi- tive term related to the interferometer noise, which is proportional to the system temperature. Since no source has signiﬁcant ﬂux in Stokes V , the rms noise levels in the V images have no gain error and were used as an estimate of σn. The error in the ﬂux density for each source is given in the main catalogue (Table 4). Typically 5 per cent of the total ﬂux density. the error is 4

The calibration term dominates over the noise for our data, are we assumed a common calibration term for all the target sources. From this we calculated the mean positional errors in right ascen- sion and declination for the full sample, giving σα = 0.9 arcsec and σδ = 1.0 arcsec. Note that this method of calculating posi- tional errors may underestimate the error for extended sources.

−

For extended sources the error was multiplied by the square root of the number of baselines nbase (normally 10 for our 5- antenna follow-up arrays) to correct for the fact that the ﬂux den- sities for these sources are estimated using only one (the shortest) baseline instead of nbase.

Many of the sources in the Australia Telescope calibrator cat- alogue were observed as target sources as part of the AT20G pro- gram. We used these sources to check the integrity of our observing and data reduction procedures. There are 362 AT calibrators in the ﬁnal AT20G catalogue. For each of these we extracted the AT cali- brator catalogue ﬂux density measurement that was closest in time to our AT20G observations of that source. Fig. 7 shows the AT cali- brator catalogue to AT20G ﬂux density ratio for these sources. The median AT20G/AT ﬂux density ratio is 1.06 0.03. All of the out- liers were found to be either extended or highly variable sources.

±

A small number of our target sources are included in the VLA Calibrator Manual3. We used these as an additional check on our ﬂux density measurements, particularly for sources near the equa- tor. The VLA calibrator data is only available up to the year 2000. This means there is a signiﬁcance difference in the times that these measurements were made. The scatter we see in our sample is

We have explored the reasons for the possible ﬂux scale differ- ences between AT20G, and ATCA and VLA calibrators. However, without simultaneous measurements on both telescopes it is difﬁ- cult to obtained a conclusive result. We see no evidence that our catalogue ﬂux densities are not on the scale set by the assumed ﬂux of 1934 638. We note that our ﬂuxes are consistent with the WMAP ﬂux scale (see Section 7) and strongly recommend a future program of simultaneous measurements of calibrator sources to tie the ﬂux scales in the north and south hemispheres, and between the major radio observatories.

5 SOURCE CATALOGUE

The primary AT20G source catalogue gives the ﬂux density and polarisation measurements at 20, 8 and 5 GHz, as well as the epoch of observation and quality ﬂags. Table 7 shows the ﬁrst 30 sources in the catalogue, the full catalogue is included in the Supporting Information for this paper, and available online through Vizier4. The columns are:

(1) AT20G source name. (2–3) Right ascension and declination (J2000). The mean errors (σα = 0.9 arcsec, σδ = 1.0 arcsec) are derived in Section 4. (4–5) Flux density at 20 GHz and error in mJy. (6–7) Flux density at 8 GHz and error in mJy. (8–9) Flux density at 5 GHz and error in mJy. (10) Epoch of observation for the three frequencies (20, 8 and 5 GHz).

The epoch codes are listed in column 1 of Table 3.

(11) Quality ﬂag (see description below) (12) Other ﬂags (see description below) (13–14) Polarized intensity at 20 GHz and error in mJy. (15) Fractional polarisation at 20 GHz. (16) Position angle at 20 GHz.

AT20G Source Catalogue

(17–18) Polarized intensity at 8 GHz and error in mJy. (19) Fractional polarisation at 8 GHz. (20) Position angle at 8 GHz. (21–22) Polarized intensity at 5 GHz and error in mJy. (23) Fractional polarisation at 5 GHz. (24) Position angle at 5 GHz.

Column 11 contains a quality ﬂag, either g (good, 5501 sources) or p (poor, 389 sources). A poor quality ﬂag indicates that there was lower quality data in that observation, or that, in the case of an extended source, the triple product ﬂux was used rather than the shortest baseline ﬂux. Hence the ﬂux density measurement for poor quality sources may not be as reliable.

Column 12 contains other ﬂags identifying the following

source types or issues:

e Source is extended and the shortest baseline ﬂux has been used (see Section 3.3). h Source identiﬁed as a Galactic HII region (Section 5.4). p Source identiﬁed as a Galactic Planetary Nebula (Section 5.4). m Source identiﬁed as part of the Magellanic Clouds (Sec- tion 5.3). l Source has no match in the low frequency surveys (NVSS and SUMSS) (Section 8.4). b Source is large and extended (see Table 5). The data in the catalogue comes from the observations presented in Burke-Spolaor et al. (2009) and discussed in Section 5.1.

AT20G catalogue sources should be referred to by their full IAU designation (Lortet et al. 1994). These are of the form AT20G DDMMSS where AT20G is the survey acronym, J JHHMMSS speciﬁes J2000.0 coordinate equinox, HHMMSS are the hours, minutes and truncated seconds of right ascension, is the sign of declination and DDMMSS are the degrees, minutes and truncated seconds of declination.

5.1 Bright extended sources

As discussed in Massardi et al. (2008), a small number of highly extended sources were expected to have a 20 GHz ﬂux density above our bright source sample cutoff of 0.5 Jy, but were unde- tected or had diminished levels of observed emission in the AT20G follow-up observations due to the sources’ extent beyond our ob- serving resolution and ﬁeld of view ( 2.4 arcminutes). These sources were identiﬁed using extrapolated ﬂux densities from the 5 GHz PMN (Grifﬁth & Wright 1993) and the 0.843 MHz SUMSS (Mauch et al. 2003) data. Integrated ﬂux density and polarisation measurements for these sources (shown in Table 5) were measured from mosaic observations done during the 2006 October polarisa- tion follow-up run. Their ﬂux densities have been included in our main catalogue and are ﬂagged with a b. The observations and data analysis are discussed fully in Burke-Spolaor et al. (2009). The ob- jects with mosaiced measurements are limited to sources south of δ =

− We note that as discussed in Section 2.1 our survey will be incomplete for sources larger than 45′′and based on simple source count arguments many hundred sources larger than a few arc min- utes will be missing. Since non-thermal extended sources have steep radio spectra we suggest that low frequency catalogues such as NVSS or SUMSS rather than AT20G be used if complete sam- ples of the extended sources are important.

5.2 Comparison with bright source sample

Some bright sources (S20 > 0.5 Jy) in this catalogue have slightly different parameters than were given in the Bright Source Sam- ple (BSS) paper (Massardi et al. 2008). There are 23 sources which have a ﬂux density that differs by more than 10 per cent from the BSS results. In most cases this is due to a different observational epoch being selected for the source in the BSS than for in the cur- rent catalogue. The largest group of sources in this category are sources from the variability sample discussed in Section 2.5. In the selection of sources for this catalogue we gave preference where possible to the epoch with simultaneous 5 and 8 GHz observations. However, in the BSS the best quality epoch at 20 GHz was chosen regardless of the availability of follow-up at other frequencies.

5.3 Magellanic Clouds

The AT20G survey area includes the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and we would expect to ﬁnd some radio sources in these galaxies, which are effectively foreground sources for cosmolog- ical studies. In earlier work using the AT20G pilot survey data, Ricci et al. (2004) and Sadler et al. (2006) simply removed 5◦ 5◦ regions of sky around the LMC and SMC to avoid the problem of foreground contamination. However, since the compact, high- frequency LMC/SMC radio sources are likely to be interesting in their own right, we have now attempted to identify them individu- ally in the ﬁnal AT20G catalogue.

×

We searched two areas of sky deﬁned by the following

(J2000) coordinates:

There are six AT20G sources in the SMC region and 21 in the LMC region. As with Galactic sources, some LMC and SMC radio sources may have complex, extended emission which is not well imaged by the AT20G snapshot observations. In such cases, the ﬂux densities and positions listed in the AT20G catalogue should be re- garded as no more than indicative. Hence one of the main reasons for identifying LMC/SMC sources is to have the option of exclud- ing them from later analysis of the extragalactic AT20G sample.

To determine whether each 20 GHz source was likely to be associated with the LMC or SMC we searched the NASA Ex- tragalactic Database (NED)5 for known LMC/SMC objects at or near the AT20G position, and cross-matched the AT20G posi- tions with lower-frequency radio catalogues from Filipovi´c et al.

6 COMPLETENESS AND RELIABILITY

The overall completeness of the AT20G catalogue is a function of both the completeness of the original scanning survey, and the com- pleteness of the follow-up survey. The methods for estimating com- pleteness for both surveys are discussed in this section. In Section 7 we compare our catalogue with the Wright et al. (2009) WMAP catalogue to assess completeness and reliability.

6.1 Scanning survey completeness

In order to estimate the completeness of the survey catalogue (the catalogue of candidate sources that was used as a basis for the follow-up observations) false point sources with known bright- ness and positions were inserted into the time ordered uncalibrated scans. The false sources were injected by taking the primary cal- ibrator observation, scaling it to the correct ﬂux and declination, applying an inverse calibration appropriate to the time of the obser- vation, and adding this to the raw data. The data was then processed using the same machinery that created the initial sky maps and a list of candidate sources including the injected sources were then detected. Finally, the extracted sources were compared to the list of input sources to measure the fraction of sources recovered as a function of ﬂux density. Further details of this process are discussed in Hancock et al. (in preparation).

This process allowed us to assess the completeness for point sources. The AT20G survey is not sensitive to sources with angu- ′′ and so our catalogue will be in- lar sizes much larger than 45 complete for extremely extended sources. This brightness sensi- tivity limit means the AT20G survey can not detect the emission from most nearby spiral galaxies, even those with integrated ﬂux densities above 100 mJy at 20 GHz. The nearby spiral NGC 253 is detected as an extended AT20G source (J004733 251717) with a 20 GHz ﬂux density of 608 mJy, and in this case the observed emission appears to arise from a central starburst rather than an AGN (see Tingay 2004; Brunthaler et al. 2009). At z=0.0008 (d=3.3 Mpc), NGC 253 is the lowest-redshift galaxy detected in the AT20G survey. Although several other spiral galaxies are detected, 000046; z=0.0038), NGC 4594 including NGC 1068 (J024240 − 492804; 113721; z=0.0036) and NGC 4945 (J130527 (J123959 z=0.0019), the detected radio emission in these galaxies appears to be associated mainly with an active nucleus rather than processes related to star formation.

6.2 Follow-up survey completeness

The completeness of the follow-up survey is a function of the com- pleteness of the scanning survey catalogue, and of the number of objects that were scheduled and observed in follow-up mode. The number of sources that we were able to observe was limited by the ﬁnite length of the project and the weather conditions during each observing run. The brightest sources in each region of the sky were observed ﬁrst so as to maximize the number of sources con- ﬁrmed and thus conserve the completeness of the follow-up obser- vations. Bad weather and occasional hardware malfunctions meant that even though a source was scheduled for observation no good data was obtained. Much of this missing data was able to be re- couped at a later stage via clean up observations, but not all.

AT20G Source Catalogue

Fig. 8 shows the source distribution for the AT20G follow- up survey source catalogue. We calculated the follow-up survey completeness (Cf ) using

where Cs is the completeness of the scanning survey (estimated us- ing the source injection method described above); nf is the number of sources detected in the follow-up survey; and ns is the number of real sources expected from the scanning survey. Note that the ﬂux densities determined from the original scanning survey were accu- rate to 20 per cent. Hence towards the ﬂux density cutoff there is a reduction in completeness due to some sources being omitted from the original candidate lists.

This region was observed last, and was ham- pered by bad weather. We had several catch-up runs but this was not enough to ﬁll in the missing area within the time limits we had set for near-simultaneous follow-up. The main region this affected was between 14 hr and 20 hr in right ascension. A full analysis of the completeness statistics, including values for each declination band with 2 hr right ascension zones will be presented in Massardi et al. (in preparation).

7 COMPARISON WITH THE WMAP 5-YEAR SOURCE

CATALOGUE

Foreground point-source removal is an important step in the analy- sis of CMB anisotropy data, since the strongest sources need to be identiﬁed and masked out of the CMB images. The WMAP team have therefore produced a catalogue of bright point sources in the WMAP sky maps at 23, 33, 41, 61 and 94 GHz (Wright et al. 2009) so that these can be masked out for CMB analysis.

Since the AT20G survey overlaps in frequency with the lowest WMAP band (20–25 GHz), and the AT20G has signiﬁcantly bet- ter sensitivity and resolution than the WMAP images, the AT20G catalogue provides an independent check of the completeness and reliability of the WMAP point-source catalogues.

Massardi et al. (2009) have recently published a detailed anal- ysis which uses data from the AT20G Bright Source Sample (Massardi et al. 2008) to evaluate several different strategies for foreground source detection in the WMAP 5-year maps. The re- lease of the full AT20G catalogue will allow similar studies to push below the 0.5 Jy BSS limit and provide deeper complete samples for Planck and other CMB experiments.

A detailed comparison of the AT20G and WMAP source cat- alogues is beyond the scope of this paper, so we focus here on two questions: (i) what is the completeness and reliability of the WMAP source catalogue? and (ii) how consistent are the AT20G and WMAP ﬂux density scales at 20–25 GHz?

7.1 Matching the AT20G and WMAP source catalogues

The WMAP 5-year source catalogue (Wright et al. 2009) con- tains 390 sources, of which 186 are in the southern hemisphere. Wright et al. (2009) note that the WMAP catalogue is expected to

be complete for sources stronger than 2 Jy in regions of the sky away from the Galactic plane, but also contains some sources with ﬂux densities as low as 0.5 Jy at 23 GHz (WMAP K-band)6.

In matching the ﬁnal AT20G catalogue with the WMAP 5- year source catalogue, we adopted the same 21.35 arcmin cutoff radius used by Massardi et al. (2008) for the AT20G Bright Source Sample. 180 of the 186 southern sources in the WMAP cata- logue were matched with at least one AT20G source within this 21.35 arcmin radius. Based on our determination of the surface den- sity of bright AT20G sources, we expect all these matches to be genuine associations.

In 16 cases (i.e. 9 per cent of the WMAP source catalogue), two or more AT20G sources make a signiﬁcant (> 10 per cent) contribution to the total ﬂux density in the 0.93◦ WMAP beam at 23 GHz. Some of these correspond to AT20G detections of several components (e.g. core and hotspot, or two hotspots) of a single ex- tended radio galaxy, while others appear to be unrelated pairs of sources.

Fig. 9 shows the offsets between the AT20G and WMAP po- sitions for sources in common. In general these are consistent with the quoted position errors (typically 4 arcmin for WMAP and less than 1 arcsec for AT20G). As expected, the offsets are generally smaller for stronger WMAP sources.

catalogue

A simple comparison of surface densities shows that the WMAP and AT20G catalogues have similar levels of completeness for strong (>1.0 Jy) sources at 20–25 GHz. The surface density of 2.2 sr−1 for AT20G and sources stronger than 1.0 Jy is 28.5 1.7 sr−1 for the WMAP K-band, where the quoted errors 26.8 are set by the sample size in each case7. Since the WMAP sur-

6 Wright et al. (2009) note that sources with ﬂux densities below 1 Jy are unlikely to be detected by WMAP unless they have ‘beneﬁted’ from a pos- itive noise or CMB ﬂuctuation. This in turn leads to a bias in the WMAP catalogue at low ﬂux densities (see, e.g. Eddington 1913; Jauncey 1968).

7 The 5-year WMAP catalogue covers 78 per cent of the sky (the remain- ing 22 per cent, at low Galactic latitude, is masked out) and lists 262 sources with 23 GHz ﬂux densities >1.0 Jy beam−1 and 123 sources with ﬂux den- sity >1.5 Jy beam−1. The AT20G catalogue covers 48 per cent of the sky (declination < 0◦ with the region |b| < 1.5◦ masked out) and lists 174 sources with 20 GHz ﬂux densities >1.0 Jy beam−1 and 85 sources with ﬂux density >1.5 Jy beam−1.

face density at 23 GHz is 94 per cent of the AT20G value, and the AT20G catalogue is essentially complete for point sources strong than 1 Jy, we estimate that the WMAP catalogue is roughly 94 per cent complete above 1 Jy at 23 GHz. Excluding the area masked in the WMAP source catalogue, we ﬁnd only one strong (> 1.5 Jy) AT20G source which is not listed in the WMAP cata- logue, AT20G J142432

Appendix A lists the eight sources in the WMAP catalogue which have no AT20G match stronger than 250 mJy within 21.35 arcmin of the WMAP position. Three of these (the radio galaxy Fornax A, a Galactic HII region and the Galactic planetary neb- ula NGC 7293) are highly-extended sources which are resolved out by the 2 arcmin ATCA beam, and so represent an incompleteness in the AT20G sample. Two sources are found in both surveys but with a very large position offset, and three sources catalogued by WMAP are not conﬁrmed by AT20G and appear to be spurious. In general, however, there is very good agreement between the AT20G and WMAP source catalogues. Since the AT20G catalogue is es- 98% of 23 GHz WMAP sources are sentially 100% reliable, and matched in AT20G, we conclude that the 23 GHz WMAP catalogue is

7.3 Comparison of the AT20G and WMAP ﬂux density scales

Fig. 10 compares the catalogued AT20G (20 GHz) and WMAP (23 GHz) ﬂux densities for the 180 sources in common.

To test for consistency of the AT20G and WMAP ﬂux-density scales, we compared the ﬂux densities of the 119 sources which were stronger than 1.0 Jy in the WMAP catalogue (to minimize measurement errors) and had only a single AT20G counterpart (to exclude extended sources for which the AT20G ﬂux densities may

The rms scatter of the individual ﬂuxes is 0.31. The main contri- bution to the standard deviation in the ﬂux ratios probably comes from variability, since the AT20G and WMAP measurements are generally not simultaneous. The typical uncertainty in the individ- ual WMAP and AT20G ﬂux density measurements is 4 5 per cent. Since the formal standard error on the mean ﬂux ratio is 0.028, we conclude that the AT20G and WMAP ﬂux density scales are con- sistent to within 2–3 per cent at 20–25 GHz.

8 ANALYSIS

8.1 Polarisation

To test the robustness of our polarization measurements we used the variability sample (see Section 2.5), selecting a set of 142 ob- jects which had good quality observations in our 2004 October, 2005 October and 2006 April observing epochs. Fig. 11 shows the fractional polarisation at 20 GHz for the 2005 October versus 2004 October observations. Crosses show measured polarisation values, and triangles show limits in one of the epochs. There is good corre- lation (albeit with signiﬁcant scatter) between each pair of epochs.

Fig. 12 shows the 20 GHz polarised intensity versus the total ﬂux density for variability sample sources observed in 2005 Octo- ber. The dashed horizontal line shows a 6 mJy limit in polarised ﬂux, a level 3–4 times the typical error in polarised ﬂux. Most of the limits (triangles) fall below this line, and so it was chosen as a reasonable level at which the polarised ﬂux density can be reliably determined (see Section 3.5). Although a small number of sources

The triangle in the upper left of Fig. 11 corresponds to source J084225–605350, which appeared highly polarized in 2005 (polar- 1 mJy, fractional polarization 5.4 per cent) and 2006 ized ﬂux 18 (16 3 mJy, fractional polarisation 4.0 per cent) but not in 2004 (< 6 mJy, fractional polarisation < 1.7 per cent).

further investigation, as it raises the possibility that some AT20G sources may be genuinely variable in polarized ﬂux.

We found a good correlation between the fractional polarisa- tion measured at 5 GHz and 8 GHz, and also a reasonable corre- lation between the fractional polarisation measured at 5 GHz and 20 GHz, although the large scatter in the latter case suggests there may be some change in the polarisation properties of the sources across the wider frequency range. There was also reasonable con- sistency in polarised position angles measured at each of the three frequencies. This will be analysed in more detail in Massardi et al. (in preparation).

8.2 Source counts

Fig. 13 shows the 20 GHz source density with in equal area declina- tion bands, for ﬂux density cutoffs of 100 mJy and 50 mJy. It shows that we have relatively homogeneous coverage of the southern sky down to 100 mJy. At a 50 mJy cutoff we have regions of incom- pleteness (notably 0◦to ◦) as discussed in Section 6. This is primarily due to bad weather in the follow-up runs.

These are well ﬁt by a power law (f (x) = (log(N ) 100 mJy where the ﬂattening of the curve is 31x a sign that the catalogue is becoming incomplete at this level. This agrees with our analysis in Section 6. Note that the source counts presented here are not corrected for completeness — this will be explored further in Massardi et al., (in preparation).

which the effects of spectral curvature can be ignored, which is clearly not the case for the AT20G sample. Hence for our analy- sis it is more appropriate to use a radio colour-colour diagram (e.g. Kesteven et al. 1977; Sadler et al. 2006). Fig. 15 shows a colour- colour plot for the 3763 AT20G sources with near-simultaneous data at 5, 8 and 20 GHz. The plot compares the lower frequency spectral index α(5, 8) with the higher frequency spectral index α(8, 20).

As noted previously by Sadler et al. (2006) and Massardi et al. (2008) this plot shows a wide range of spectral types at 20 GHz. Four main types can be identiﬁed:

(i) Sources with steep (falling) spectra, which are shown in the 57 per cent of the sample

lower left quadrant. These represent and include a higher fraction of power law spectra.

∼

(ii) Sources with peaked (GPS) spectra, which rise at lower fre- quencies and fall at higher frequencies. These are shown in the lower right quadrant and represent

21 per cent of the sample.

∼

(iii) Sources with inverted (rising) spectra, which are shown in 14 per cent of sources. (iv) Sources with an upturn in their spectra, shown in the upper

the upper right quadrant. These make up

∼

left quadrant. These represent

∼

8 per cent of the sample.

The diagonal line indicates sources whose spectrum can be represented by a single power law. More sources lie below this line than above it, suggesting that most sources steepen with increasing frequency. For the ﬂat spectrum sources in particular there is no evi- dence for power law spectra. This demonstrates that high frequency ﬂux densities cannot be reliably estimated from low frequency sur- veys by extrapolating from a single power-law spectrum.

We have also identiﬁed a new class of sources with ultra- inverted spectra (α(5, 20) > +0.7). These are shown as open cir- cles in Fig. 15 and discussed in the next section.

8.4 Low–frequency catalogues and Ultra–Inverted Spectrum

(UIS) radio sources

To test whether the AT20G survey has found any new radio–source population not seen at lower frequency, we cross-matched the AT20G catalogue with the 1.4 GHz NVSS (Condon et al. 1998) and 843 MHz SUMSS (Mauch et al. 2003) and MGPS-2 (Murphy et al.

2007) surveys, which together cover the whole AT20G survey area. The 40 mJy cutoff of the AT20G catalogue is an order of magni- tude brighter than the NVSS and SUMSS/MGPS-2 completeness limits (which are typically 2.5–10 mJy, depending on declination), so we expect the vast majority of AT20G sources to have an NVSS or SUMSS match within 10–15 arcsec on the sky. AT20G sources without a counterpart in the NVSS and SUMSS catalogues must have either a sharply–rising radio spectrum (with α > +0.5) or highly variable radio emission. Our cross-matching identiﬁed 27 AT20G sources (0.4 per cent of the AT20G catalogue) with no counterpart in the NVSS and SUMSS/MGPS-2 catalogues, and these are listed in Table 7. For eleven of them, examination of the original NVSS and SUMSS sur- vey images shows a weak source at the AT20G position — these ob- jects are detected at the 3σ level but fall below the NVSS/SUMSS catalogue limit. For the remaining sixteen objects, Table 7 lists a 3σ upper limit to the low-frequency NVSS/SUMSS ﬂux density.

Recent results from the 15 GHz 9C survey also conﬁrm a population of high-frequency sources that fall below the lim- its of low-frequency catalogues. At ﬂux densities of 10–15 mJy, Waldram et al. (2009) ﬁnd that 4.3 per cent of their 15 GHz sources are not listed in NVSS.

All the sources in Table 7 have (non-simultaneous) 1–20 GHz spectral indices α(1, 20) > +0.7. An obvious question is whether these extreme spectral indices are the result of source variability between the NVSS/SUMSS and AT20G observing epochs. This does not generally appear to be the case. The sources in Table 7 are also among the most extreme AT20G objects in terms of their (simultaneous) 5–20 GHz spectral index, with a median value of α(5, 20) = +0.68 (the median α(5, 20) for the AT20G sample as a whole is 485420 and 0.22). In all but two cases (J032945 J123229 840247), the data in Table 7 are consistent with the ex- istence of a population of objects with a rapidly-rising power–law

By analogy with the Ultra–Steep spectrum (USS) radio sources with α < 1.3 (Blumenthal & Miley 1979; Tielens et al. 1979) we introduce the term “Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) radio source” to describe the class of radio sources with a spectral index α(5, 20) > +0.7.

−

The AT20G catalogue contains 45 sources with α(5, 20) > +0.7 (roughly 1.2% of the AT20G sources with 5 and 8 GHz data), and these are listed in Table 8. A few of these sources are detected in linear polarization, conﬁrming that the emission mechanism is non-thermal, so we assume for now that all the AT20G UIS ob- jects are extragalactic non-thermal sources. Further investigation is needed to conﬁrm this, but we note that the UIS sources have the same distribution in Galactic latitude as the main AT20G sample and show no concentration towards the Galactic plane.

Fig. 16 compares the AT20G sources in Table 7 with the sam- ple of High Frequency Peakers (HFPs) studied by Dallacasa et al. (2000), who measured simultaneous ﬂux densities at several fre- quencies between 1.4 and 22.5 GHz for a sample of 55 sources selected to have inverted spectra with α(1, 5) > +0.5. Our AT20G UIS sources with α(5, 20) > +0.7 have radio spectra which rise more rapidly with frequency than any of the HFP sample. If the AT20G UIS sources peak at frequencies near or above above 20 GHz, the O’Dea (1998) relation between spectral peak and source size implies that these are expected to be very young, com- pact radio sources less than a few tens of parsecs in size.

Figure 16. Comparison of 1 − 5 and 5 − 20 GHz spectral indices for the sources in Table 7 (ﬁlled circles) and the ‘High-Frequency Peaker’ sample of Dallacasa et al. (2000) (crosses). Open circles show AT20G UIS sources (Table 8) which have both α(5, 20) > +0.7 and α(1, 20) > +0.7.

sources have previously been identiﬁed. They include the z = 0.089 galaxy III Zw 2 (Falcke et al. 1999; Brunthaler et al. 2003) and the z = 0.644 quasar RXJ 1415+3337 (Orienti & Dallacasa 2008). Falcke et al. (1999) measured a spectral index of α = 0.1 between 5 and 10 GHz for III Zw 2, with a spectral peak +1.9 near 40 GHz, while RXJ 1415+3337 has α = +0.9 between 1 and 22 GHz. Both sources show an evolution of the radio spectrum over timescales of several years, with the spectral peak slowly moving to lower frequencies, and III Zw 2 can be modelled in terms of a single, adiabatically–expanding homogeneous radio component (Orienti & Dallacasa 2008).

8.5 Optical Identiﬁcations

Optical counterparts of the full AT20G sample were found by cross-matching the radio positions with optical positions in the Su- perCOSMOS database (Hambly et al. 2001). AT20G objects within 10◦ of the Galactic plane were excluded from this analysis due to the presence of foreground stars and Galactic dust extinction, leav- ing a total of 4932 objects used in this analysis. Optical identiﬁ- cations were chosen to be the closest optical source to the radio position within a 2.5 arcsec radius and brighter than a B magnitude of 22, which is the SuperCOSMOS completeness limit.

studies have found that 97 per cent of sources selected in this way are likely to be genuine associations (Sadler et al. 2006).

Using this selection method there are 2958 AT20G sources (60 per cent) with optical identiﬁcations, the majority of which are QSOs. This is much higher than seen in low frequency ra- dio surveys which typically have an optical identiﬁcation rate of 25 30 per cent. This again highlights the signiﬁcant difference of the AT20G source population from other radio selected AGN sam- ples. Full analysis of the optical properties of these objects will be published separately (Mahony et al. in preparation)

9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

We present a catalogue of 5890 sources from the Australia Tele- scope 20 GHz survey, the deepest large-area survey at high radio frequency. For 3766 of these sources we have near-simultaneous 5 and 8 GHz measurements, and 1559 sources have a detection in polarized total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies.

The 20 GHz ﬂux densities measured for the strongest AT20G sources are in excellent agreement with the WMAP 5-year source catalogue recently published by Wright et al. (2009), and we ﬁnd that the WMAP source catalogue is close to complete (and highly reliable) for sources stronger than 1.5 Jy at 23 GHz.

We identify a population of Ultra-Inverted Spectrum radio sources with a spectral index of α(5, 20) > +0.7. These are rare sources, comprising roughly 1.2 per cent of the AT20G population. There are several ongoing projects as part of the AT20G. Mas- sardi et al. (in preparation) will present a statistical analysis of the AT20G sources, and Hancock et al. (in preparation) will present results from the original scanning survey. Mahony et al. (in prepa- ration) is carrying out an analysis of the optical identiﬁcations of AT20G sources. Sadler et al. (2008) are following up subsamples of the AT20G sources at 95 GHz. Murphy et al. (2009) is target- ing a subset of Galactic sources that were excluded from the main follow-up survey. Chhetri et al. (in preparation) has carried out a search for gravitational lens candidates and planetary nebulae using data from the 6 km baseline. In a related project, Sadler et al. (in preparation) is conducting a deeper survey at 20 GHz to explore the high frequency radio population at much lower ﬂux densities.

APPENDIX A: WMAP SOURCES MISSING FROM THE AT20G CATALOGUE

Table A1 lists the eight WMAP sources that do not have a cata- logued bright (> 250 mJy) AT20G source within 21.35 arcmin of the WMAP position. These ‘missing’ sources fall into several cat- egories which are discussed in the following sections.

A1 Bright nearby radio galaxies with large angular size

As noted by Massardi et al. (2008), the radio galaxy Fornax A 3711) is not detected in the AT20G survey be- (WMAP J0322 cause most of its 20 GHz ﬂux density arises from diffuse emission associated with the lobes, which are resolved out by the 2 arcmin ATCA beam. Fornax A is the only bright extragalactic source known to be missing from the AT20G catalogue.

A3 Extragalactic WMAP sources not found in AT20G

There are three remaining WMAP sources 6928, 7714) for which no obvious counterpart J1150 can be found in the AT20G catalogue. All three of these sources are detected in each of the ﬁve WMAP single-year images (Wright et al. 2009), and do not appear to vary signiﬁcantly in ﬂux density over this ﬁve-year timespan.

J0632-6928 has a WMAP ﬂux density of 0.4 Jy, making it the weakest K-band (23 GHz) detection in the Wright et al. (2009) catalogue, but it is detected (as a sub-Jy source) in all 5 WMAP bands. The closest AT20G source, J063455-694532, is 0.4 deg away and has a ﬂux density of 66 mJy beam−1 at 20 GHz and 154 mJy beam−1 at 5 GHz. Its PMN counterpart is PMN J0634- 8 mJy beam−1, and the SUMSS 6945 with a ﬂux density of 92 3.8 mJy beam−1. AT20G J063455-694532 ﬂux density is 123.1 seems too faint to be a plausible identiﬁcation for the WMAP source.
