        "Place_Reviews": "QT Canberra: Our stay at QT Hotel in Canberra was outstanding! The true test of a hotel's quality is how they handle things when they go wrong, and QT Hotel passed with flying colors. We experienced a minor issue during our stay, but the staff's prompt and efficient response turned it into a positive experience. This is one of the hardest reviews I have had to do. I would have given it his zero stars if not for the staff. The staff there are amazing. Really good. Nothing is too much trouble. The service is great. That‚Äôs where it ends sadly. Having stayed in multiple QT hotels, I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the rooms compared to the other locations. Rooms are usually extremely lavish and quirky yet the QT Canberra felt more like an IBIS. The lobby sadly is the only real modern aspect to the hotel. There is also extensive and noisy construction going on outside which can be heard even with the balcony door closed. $365 a night no breakfast. Right next door to major build works. There is no where close to get brunch or the like as this hotel does not open for food until 12pm. The room is adequate but not stunning which is why I feel like this is a $160-$200 Max place as it is quite ordinary. Prices on the menu are not correct, there is an additional charge. Good location. Parking at $30 per day which feels a lot on top of the accommodation.",

Reception staff pleasant. Bar down stairs was quiet with a TV and lounges. The alcohol was reasonably priced.  The heating system wasn't quite that good and there wasn't any blankets but everything else was good Great place for an overnight stop and a meal. I can't fault this hotel. It is excellent value. Very pleasant staff. Good sized, clean, modern room on the 3rd floor with all inclusions. On site restaurant with well-priced meals and a very good buffet breakfast. The on-site parking is behind a secure gate. Will definitely stop here again on our way through Canberra. We have stayed here a number of times and always had a lovely room, however this time we must gave lucked out as we had the worst room, the carpet was old and dirty and the furniture all chipped and the shower impossible to regulate, it had two settings, Scalding hot or cold. Took a science degree and steady hand to find the right sweet spot. So if they book you in to 205 ask for another room! Be careful to not to be burnt when shower because water temperature is unstable. It can be freezing or very hot. Room is freezing. Air con temperature in the room can‚Äôt be controlled. Set 30 degrees but still freezing. One of the lamps was not work. Beautiful clean friendly rooms were warm beds comfortable absolute delight topping it off the breakfast was frigging amazing my wife is gluten & dairy free and they were great in  accommodating her needs.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Garden City Hotel, BW Signature Collection: The accommodation was truly excellent. The room was dated but decently clean.  The shower pressure was good, but the temperature fluctuated.  The very squeaky door to the room was fixed after I mentioned it.  The light flickered in the bathroom in a creepy way, but I forgot to mention that until my last day.  The buffet breakfast for $25 was terrible.  Selection was poor, and quality was low. I‚Äôll start with the positives first. The staff were friendly and helpful. The water pressure is strong, the aircon works fine and the bedroom and bathroom was clean (but outdated). I tried the dinner room service and the food was tasty. My granddaughters and I had a fabulous week in the ACT using GCH as our base. We didn't use the bar or restaurant, but the fare looked quite acceptable. We also didn't use the pool as it was the middle of winter, though it looked beautiful. I don‚Äôt know where to start from. Room was an absolute shocker for me and my husband. The pictures they have posted online don‚Äôt match when you see them live. There was a very unpleasant smell in the entrance, throughout the hall way to the rooms. Room was very small, was not cleaned properly. There were tissues in the bedroom bin and the toilet bin already. The cups, glasses and the spoons were dirty. When I told the guy in reception about the cup, he was not interested in swapping. He was like oh ok bring the cup downstairs and I will swap it for you, seriously? Why did I pay $154 for? Never going back there again. The receptionist was rude.",

The location is notably convenient, nestled close to the shopping center of Canberra, making it an ideal spot for those looking to explore the city's retail offerings. The premises were consistently clean and quiet, providing a peaceful retreat after a day's work. I cannot recommend this hotel enough! The customer service was amazing from check in to check out, the rooms were big and spacious, very clean amenities and very close to the city centre. Parking was extra $ but that's expected in the city - it's private and secure so was worth the money. Definitely book if you want a nice room, good sleep and a stones throw to the Westfield, coffee shops and restaurants. 2 bed apartment needs upgrade.  Beds were as hard ad rocks! Microwave from 80s and some mould on bathroom.  Two LIFTS not working very inconvenient.  Cost high just the same. Air con in lounge very old with old remote. Great location, staff were friendly. The apartments are a generous size but they are in desperate need of an upgrade. The building was built in the early 90s and the kitchen and bathrooms are definitely from that era. Room pretty run down, hot water system needs an update if you want to bath and shower.",

There's only 2 things I would fault here, or it would be a 5 for me. One, there was only the option of tap water or sparkling. I prefer still mineral water. Two, the finger carrot was raw and not tasty. Otherwise, every other dish was perfectly matched and delicious! The staff were attentive and friendly.

Was nice and just right for a cold night to warm up. The noodles were not very long in length. I think the cook might have cut them while cooking.  Probably a bit too much onion and there was not much separation in the ingredients- by which I mean it all melded together a bit and was a bit greasy. Others had the Singapore box and that was much better - so maybe I just got a average serve. I would recommend this if you are in a hurry. I ordered the chicken noodle and veg box but the box came was an enormous amount of noodles and no vegetables or protein. The only piece of chicken in the meal did not  taste fresh at all. A pretty l decent amount of food in each dish. I got two. Probably way too much rice compared to the protein‚Ä¶that would be my only issue. Apart from that, it tasted good and filled me up.

Staff are attentive and provide efficient service in a warm and approachable manner. Water was provided straight away. Drinks were served quite quickly after placing the order and my knife replaced with a steak knife before the food arrived. No matter how many times I go, the food presentation is impressive. Servings are generous and taste delicious. Hotcakes where light and fluffy, and cooked all the way through, a success for a hotcake so thick. The banana bread was satisfying, not overly sweet, not too dense, and still full of great banana flavour. I loved seeing morning steak on the menu - it makes me nostalgic. This item even blew away my great memories. If you've never had Steak n Eggs for breakfast this is the place to do it. Steak was cooked well, though a little under seasoned for my taste. The bacon was crispy, the eggs just runny and without an acidic after taste, an the holindaise was delicate and creamy. It's a great place to come again, and bring friends. A couple of beers the night prior saw the need for a bacon sandwich and boy did this place deliver! There is a good chance it was the best bacon sandwich I‚Äôve ever paid for. There was so much bacon it was spilling out the sides. Nothing like a morning coffee with some gorgeous breakfast. With a Latte in one hand and muffin in the other, my brunch at Rocksalt Hawker was gladly a great start. My coffee was a lovely flavour and well mixed, however i did find the drink hot for a least 30 minutes. A little hiden gem and glade i live close enough to be able to go back. Next visit big breakfast. Totally recommend. First time here to try it out. The food was ok, nothing out of the ordinary. The steak was too chewy. I found the servings too small for a big price tag. No warm welcome or a smile. If I'm going to spend that much, I expect someone to show appreciation for going there. Food is quite pricey. We've had breakfast quite a few times, and the Turkish bread is cut into sticks, which is a little weird, especially with the big breakfast. The butter in the little plastic containers is messy and annoying. Great coffee.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Subway Canberra Airport: I was truly disappointed with the serving size of my salad bowl on my first visit to this Subway branch. Despite regularly ordering the same item at other branches, the meager serving here was disheartening. It's my hope that the store manager takes note and ensures staff are trained to meet standard portion sizes. Additionally, I hope the server understands that being stingy isn't conducive to her career advancement and might drive customers away. I would probably give this branch another shot next time, and I'm open to adjusting my review if I see improvements during my next visit. Surprisingly good. It's standard Subway food but the service was great. The guy working was friendly and stayed open a little past closing to serve me. Doesn‚Äôt put enough quantity compared to other subways. Really bad. Ordered latte, expressly said 'ordinary milk not skim, no sugar'. Tastes like rubbish. Very sweet. Took back to counter and was told they cannot make a latte except with skim milk powder! It's revolting el cheapo skim milk powder and is undrinkable. Said I couldn't drink it. No refund offered. Just told 'Sorry.  That is the new model.' Very polite but it's not what I ordered and I've thrown away $2.70 on dishwater. Good amount of ingredients. Not stingy",

Oddly I find the price of my meal changes during the week??? Not sure what that is.  Certainly was more than accept for food court sustenance! Disgusting service. I asked for a subway melt and after the meat was placed on the bread was told they don't do them anymore cool. Before I could say that's fine the chicken meat that had been on the ham was thrown back into the rest if the chicken and the ham thrown back. The bread was put back in the cabinet. Such casual contamination of food, let alone those people who have religious requirements not to eat or touch pork! Went for a subway on Friday 16/09/22. Ruined my day!!! My experience at Subway today was terrible! I would have rated this no stars if it were possible! I wanted my birthday deal, but after ordering I was unable to receive it, as it was unavailable at this particular store. Which resulted in having to pay for something I would have not ordered if I knew. Would never go here again. Still fairly new in trying Subway, the customer service was very smooth and the food taste pretty good. I didn‚Äôt get too stressed from ordering which is nice, the staff who catered me wasn‚Äôt rude but patient. I would comeback againüòä",

When I went for pickup my order then there was a lady on the counter who was serving another client and she asked me if I have an order. I told her my name, she took the food and thrown it in front of me as you don‚Äôt even serve animals that way (store wasn‚Äôt busy) No Thank you, no welcome, just ignored!! Why is that??? Very disappointed Whenever I try to order food in person from them they always overcharge my order. I get a salami sub which on the app is around $10 for footlong on the app but whenever I do it in person they charge me $14 to $18 (it has been $14 and $16 and other amounts as well) It‚Äôs gotten to the point where if I order from them it‚Äôs NEVER in person and always through the app as I‚Äôm really tired of having to pay extra. Lena from Subway Weston was very helpful and lovely after we called having some issues on the app! Thank you Lena :) Terrible customer service; are staff here trained fir customer service?, they look annoyed, bored, unpleasant, and arrogant talking to customers I placed an online order for two wraps, one fresh and one grilled. When I arrived to pick up the order, the staff were very unfriendly, abrupt, and blunt. The grilled wrap had grill marks but was cold inside, and the cheese was not melted. The salad was minimal on both,  not what I would expect on a large wrap.  I have received more salad when I have bought the same wrap at other Subway outlets.  The cookies were hard, not like the soft ones I've had at other stores. I'm not sure whether they were overcooked or just old. I also note that this Subway charges a flat $1 surcharge on all orders. That is, if you place the same order at the Phillip franchise, it will cost $1 less. My advice, take a 3-minute trip to Phillip and place your order there.",

The people serving not very inviting and not smiling. I mean you chose you job not one is forcing you to be there. (My opinion for underlying rudeness) The bread is terrible, very chewy and tastes old. Pretty much as per the other reviews, they don't put much in the sub. For $15.50, you're better off getting a burrito from Zambrero or a wrap from Oporto. These people have never seen a sandwich in their lives couldn't make a sandwich to save said lives. The whole point of a sandwich is to get a little bit of everything in each bite yum. The sandwich I got the ingredients were in different area codes Their motto is how little can I put on this sandwich. I asked for capsicum and she showed me 1 out of 2 peices she had put on. Been here multiple times and it's worse every time. I wasn't the only customer questioning how little they were putting on!

Absolutely disgusting customer service and terrible subway by the way, half of the filling what you usually get at any other subway. I ordered this morning and one of subway staff is so rude. I told her like that you talk to your customers she replied my voice is bit loud. Her attitude does not match with her voice. She ruined my day. If you working in any store You have to keep smiling and gentle with your customers its not your house. I will never visit to this store again. After i ordered a pizza melt 6 inch, my 9yr old daughter decided to order the same. The staff were good and joined both to make a foot long in price, rather than pay for each separately. The fillings were given generously. Only complaint was the lettuce had what looked like rotten bits through it. The staff member got a fresh container of lettuce but this also had the same through it. She picked it out for me, thank you. Worst subway when i opened my order there was no salad in the roll was all wrapped around roll.all i could taste is sauce after asking for a very small amount. Will never go back Really rude staff. I asked for quesadilla and somehow she heard sub. I clarified, I wanted quesadilla and she didn‚Äôt look happy.

However because the walls are carpeted, it feels like you're in a cauldron. It's fine for winter but on a 30 degree day, it is quite uncomfortable and there is no air-conditioning. As far as the service is concerned, there is only one lady servicing and waiting all the tables. She definitely does her best but she is overworked. Her name starts with 'D'. The owner just sat around and didn't bother to help. When we walked in, we were made to sit at a table that was not cleared. It was messy and the owner did nothing. We had to wait for a good 15 mins before the one lone server was able to get to our table. Not a good start to our experience but thankfully it picked up from there. Very pricey but we knew that before we arrived. Their menu and pricing is available online. The food in our group was prepared beautifully,  and were delicious, consistent with it's price. Too many tables for the space allowed in the restaurant, which subtracted from the atmosphere somewhat. However, it was clear that this was a popular restaurant. For a Monday night, most tables were occupied! Food is good but not worth the price tag. Service is quite slow.

We were sat by the fire, which elevated the dining experience and we could have sat there all evening. The service was outstanding! We will definitely be back to try the lunch menu and enjoy the views during the daylight! Always a bit of a favourite spot of ours for a wine tasting or weekend lunch, Poacher's Pantry was the most perfect venue for when our wedding came along. My partner and I showed up at Poacher‚Äôs Pantry close to 2pm towards the tail end of the lunch service. Our server Jack welcomed us warmly and was so attentive throughout our time there. We selected the $85 set menu and there were definitely no regrets with that choice. Lovely balanced flavors, the portions were very reasonable and filling for the price. Perhaps because we came during a quieter time of the day, Jack really took his time to explain the dishes and made us feel like we were going on a journey from course to course. We enjoyed learning about the chef‚Äôs intentions and the background behind the family business which made the dishes even more meaningful. The duck was definitely the highlight of the dishes. To top it all off, when Jack learned that we were there to celebrate our anniversary and a birthday he shouted us a couple of our drinks which was much appreciated. We‚Äôre not locals but hope to visit again one day- perhaps try another seasonal menu! Highly recommended! We had the opportunity to attend the Poachers Pantry Smokehouse Restaurant for the Poachers truffle dinner event. On a cold, blustery, and rather feral evening, we were cozy in the restaurant, oblivious to the elements. The food and wine pairing was delicious, the staff delightful, attentive, and engaging. Poachers is a must visit if you're in the Canberra wine region. Poachers out in Spring Range is one of those places we just keep going back to year after year. This trip took us out to try their new autumn menu as we heard their new chef (Adam Wilson ex. OTIS) was doing great things. It didn‚Äôt disappoint. We shared the king prawns entree, duck breast mains and 2 of the most amazing deserts I‚Äôve had in a long time. A small Friday lunch turned into quite the affair!. It‚Äôs easy to gush about a place like this and worth the 20 min drive from north Canberra. Autumn and spring would have to be two of the best times to go out, garden is in full flight and wines were spot on (both poachers Riesling and the Lark Hill sticky we tried). Jack at front of house looked after us and ensured that service was spot on. Managed to get out without any add on purchases which is never easy but the wife wasn‚Äôt with me this time üòâ",

I am not a fan of seafood due to its odour, but the dishes had no  fishy scent, and portion size was ampleand scrumptious. I eager to explore  other menu items on my next visit. My friend Anj recommended Jimmy's, so last Friday, I decided to take my family there. They have a great selection of takeaway family meals, though, so we decided to just takeaway. Pack A ($43.89, good for four) came with Mongolian Beef (truly delicious!), boneless Chicken with Lemon Sauce (moist and flavourful), fried rice (my kids took it all), and three spring rolls that were great but probably would have been even better if we had them freshly fried (we took 15 minutes to get home). We also ordered a hot and sour soup that my wife enjoyed. The counter lady was very friendly and we didn't wait long for our food. Overall, a great experience, we would definitely return and dine in so that we can really enjoy all that food fresh from their kitchen. Dishonest restaurant. The waitress told me that a certain type of chicken is out of stock and asked if i am happy to change to another type of chicken for the same dish without mentioning any additional cost. Not until checkout are we informed that we have to pay $7 extra for the change. They argued with us and insisted us to pay.",

        "Place_Reviews": "La Cantina Italian Restaurant: Upon entering we were greeted with warm lighting and beautifully exposed brick. The place was adorned with a gallery of imitation renaissance artwork. Visited La Cantina on Sunday for a friend's birthday dinner. We had a great dining experience at La Cantina. The decor is reminiscent of a wine cellar and there were famous Italian paintings on the walls. The service was excellent and the food delicious. We enjoyed the service, food and atmosphere here. The best pizza I‚Äôve had in Australia - and I‚Äôve been to a good number of pizza joints. Since we were due for a lunch or dinner date at a restaurant starting with the letter ‚ÄòL‚Äô our ‚ÄòABC‚Äô lunch/dinner group chose La Cantina. One of our party had dined here with work colleagues on several occasions and the pizza came highly recommended.",

        "Place_Reviews": "The Tea Lounge: Had dinner there during new year‚Äôs Eve. We have ordered Oyster and each of us ordered starters and main course. I guess because it was NYE, waiters were quite occupied. Starters arrived before Oysters. The starters were only warm but not hot. General dinner taste good , just that on the service side can be a bit more attentive. This is why I am giving it a 4 stars. The high tea for a special occasion/celebration was a great experience. The atmosphere with the relaxed old world hotel charm was a highlight. The staff were professional, friendly and attentive. As for the main event (the food), the three tiers were very good with savory options on the bottom plate, a ‚Äúhot option‚Äù which was brought on a separate plate, scones and jam on the second tier and sweet delicacies on the top. The flavors were excellent with great barista coffee and teas. We were so looking forward to this experience as part of our stay. It turned out to be the most disappointing part of our visit to Canberra. Went for high tea. Food was a little disappointing - prob would not go back. This experience was wonderful. The location was beautiful and such a lovely area to walk and have a look at the Bejing Gardens.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Hellenic Club of Canberra: The Hellenic club is a Canberra institution and has a great food offering with Ginseng (Asian), Filos (Greek), and of course the Bistro. All the restaurants are good quality and worth a try. There is also a kids play area in the bistro area which is a great distraction for the kids. Hellenic Club of Phillip would have to be one of the nicest places I've walked into lately! It was a beautiful night of dancing. Good varied food. Tasty. Three restaurants: one of them with Chinese food, the second with Greek food. Various drinks. We came here to the disco 90. after which we started dancing with the DJ.  We danced until 1 am.  We'll definitely come back The Ginseng Restaurant catered to my requests perfectly for my mother's 80th Birthday celebrations. We had a room to ourselves and were able to bring some decorations and a cake. They even provided candles when I forgot them. The only place in south Canberra I know of that sells Galaktoboureko! Cheap cocktails, good food- would recommend the creamy garlic prawns! and it hosts good events, such as Steve-O and Issac Butterfield.",

        "Place_Reviews": "La Rustica: Like the coffee club‚Ä¶ but for dinner the Food is incredibly average. Very good service. There  is outdoor sitting, so they are dog friendly. I ordered caprese and spaghetti primavera - very good vegetarian option. Also, tiramisu  was amazing  ! Not too sweet, exactly as I love. A warm, inviting atmosphere, lots of young, friendly staff providing table service, and lots of loyal clientele. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Booking a table for peak times is advised. The menu has a decent range of classic Italian choices. My friend and I selected garlic bread and a slow cooked beef brisket main course,  complemented with sangiovese and chianti red wines. What\"s better than toast and beef in winter? La Rustica Restaurant in Kingston offers an unparalleled culinary experience that is worth savoring. From the moment I entered, the warm and inviting ambiance set the stage for an exceptional dining journey. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, providing impeccable service throughout. I highly recommend this restaurant‚Äù",

After our initial meeting with James, we knew the Boathouse was the venue for us and locked it in straight away without bothering with any other places. OMG.  Christmas lunch!  Thanks so much!  What a lunch!  On the lake beside the poor soggy black swan.  Staff were fantastic.  Could not fault them from the lovely greeting at the outset to escorting everyone to their cars under umbrellas at the end!  Thanks for that -- it sets you apart from others. The Boat House team did an incredible job hosting our wedding. Celebrated a special lunch birthday with family and this was such a treat. While the layout was very open and the view superb, it was a bitingly cold day. However, not only was it lovely and warm, the atmosphere was friendly. Our waiter was Matt and so charming, professional and just the right amount of sass. I enjoyed my lamb main and was cheeky enough to ask for Chefs Choice in dessert (presented with a flourish and ‚ÄúSurprise!‚Äù), for me the standout was the Jerusalem Artichoke ravioli. Sublime! The meal was really nice, though my main .. the beef fillet was over-cooked. The staff were nice, though the atmosphere seemed a little flat. This may have been because the temperature was a little cold in the restaurant, was cold outside, and with such an open space the sound from other tables carried.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Lemon Grass Thai Restaurant: The aroma drew me in. Lovely service, prompt and efficient. Food was fresh and vibrant both visually and on the palate. Great selection of wines/beverages. A bit disappointed in the food. Was very sweet for a authentic Thai restaurant. Nothing was spicy at all including the Tom Yam. Zero chilies. Staff was wonderful and helpful. Very fast service, atmosphere was a bit dated. Needs some work. Canberra's best kept secret! Just a block away from the hustle and bustle, this gem has incredible beautiful food, great service and is one of the cheapest meals you'll eat! I cannot recommend this place enough! We will definitely be back! The food is decent. The portion sizes could be slightly better but it's okay overall for the price.  Ordered the pork dish for lunch. The lunch menu on weekdays is good if you are looking to grab something that's reasonably priced. We had dinner on a Friday night and it was quiet quick friendly and delicious. Seems most of the customers order delivery nowadays which meant we had the whole place to ourselves.",

Prompt delivery, food nice and hot. The dishes are a bit hit and miss - some dishes significantly better than others so I'd definitely give this restaurant another chance if your experience wasn't that great in the first try. I recommend crispy chicken and guilin noodles. Mixed reviews so hoped for the best but wish I hadn‚Äôt. Chefs special hot and Spicey chicken was just a container of bones. Their special fried rice has peas and carrots in it. Won‚Äôt bother again- extremely disappointed. Tasty food, but had to wait two hours to get it. Ordered at 6.30pm, estimated delivery time was 7.45pm. Phoned at 8.05pm to see where my order was and was told it had been delivered... huh? After explaining it hadn‚Äôt, was then told it was being cooked now and would be another 20 minutes. Offered a 10% discount on a future order after complaining, turned that down as doubt I‚Äôll be ordering from here again. Final delivery time was 8.25pm. From start to finish Diamond Chinese restaurant in belconnen had me smiling all the way!!! :-) :-) :-)",

We ordered the Beef carpaccio and the Octopus to share,  both well worth it. Our mains were a ragu pasta, pork and fennel sausage pasta, ricotta tortellini with a sage and butter sauce..which was amazing!! I had the Cowra lamb with Jus. Came here for lunch. Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Love the warm and crisp focaccia with ricotta and honey. My Tortellini was amazing as well! They do decent amount of vegetarian options which is really nice. Will definitely come back again! Great food.  We had the bread, pasta and filet.  Filet was cooked to perfection.  The wine and Prosecco were great.  The location was great. I visited mezzalira to celebrate a birthday, and it turned out to be a very disappointing experience. We brought a birthday cake to enjoy after our meal, but the staff informed us that we were not allowed to eat it there. This was quite upsetting, as we had called ahead to confirm it was okay.",

We held an important life ceremony here, and Adrian was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Irene was amazing as well, capturing numerous professional-quality photos for us. We are deeply grateful for their dedication and professionalism. Our ‚ÄòABC‚Äô dinner group chose this restaurant for  one of our alphabet inspired dinner dates. We all thoroughly enjoyed experience with delectable food and excellent service. We had a very charming and attentive gentleman serve out table and he was very helpful in ensuring the one member of our group who is vegetarian and allergic to crustaceans was provided with excellent alternative dishes when required. We eat here fairly regularly and have never been able to fault the food, service or atmosphere.  Food is always great and the wine list is very good, too. It's actually more than very reasonably priced for the quality of food and service. Lovely restaurant and staff. This place provided an amazing I recently dined at Lanterne, and my experience was far from satisfactory. The atmosphere lacked any sense of warmth or comfort. Adding to the disappointment was the poor customer service; the staff seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the evening.",

Worst Mc ever, worst chips ever seen, dry and cold, floppy, soft. Bad service and low accurate food. I ordered four big macs to take away. And then waited for more than 20 minutes at the counter. The kitchen staff refused to fulfill the order. After I got my food and went home, I found all the big Macs only had a single beef patty each. Watched our order get packed and told to wait for more fries. Waited 10 minutes for fries to be made then watched them sit in the bag on the pass for another 10 so they were limp and cold. Burgers had gone cold. Asked multiple times what the hold up was, as at least 12 other people had come, ordered and gone while we waited. Got no answer. No apologies or any acknowledgement really at all. Absolutely awful fries, bitter and overcooked. Almost as if the oil hasn't been changed in a few days.",

Writing this before I even get home because I loved it so much. Great spot for a romantic dinner out. Delicious food (perfectly cooked meats, veg etc), great service, lovely atmosphere. This is a lovely little restaurant with supposedly great ambiance, however, we were seated near the entrance and it was not as nice as the sections in the back. The food was decent but did not quite live up to expectations. The oysters were fresh and tasty, the bread was delicious but the starter and the main were a bit underwhelming. The kingfish sashimi was ok but a bit overdressed. The blue eye cod with seared scallops was tasty but the sauce was a bit thin and watery. I would rather not say anything about the house-made ice cream. Tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood with plenty of parking, Rubicon delivered not only excellent food but also impeccable service. I was there dining alone and the staff were so accommodating. The service was amazing.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Sage Dining Rooms: This was our first visit to Sage and we were very impressed. We went for dinner and had the 5 course chef pick along with the paired cocktails for me and matched local wines for my boyfriend. The food was sensational and lived up to the reputation of trip advisors number 1 fine dining restaurant in Australia for 2020. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt often comment too much on food but for him to say the food was really good as well is huge! The staff were very friendly, professional and attentive. Special mention to Maddy who was exceptional and took very good care of us. The only point I could make was to remove the butchers paper from the tables as it detracted from the fine dining experience. Other than that it was a wonderful experience and I can highly recommend especially for a date night. The mint garden outside is a beautiful setting for a cheeky drink or two. Definitely add sage to your to visit list, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Sage provide a brilliant dining experience that can't be faulted. The location and interior are beautiful and a lot of work has been put in to make it a unique experience. The experience at Sage was nothing short of being absolutely splendid and truly special. It was my wife's birthday and the waitstaff did their very best to make it a truly beautiful and unforgettable experience. Ella, Owen, Bethany and Ainslie were so engaging, ensuring to explain every dish that came our way and went out of their way to provide for our every need. The food was undoubtedly lip-smacking, albeit the portion size being rather small. The  crocodile burger as a bar snack the trout were stand out dishes for us. Food at Sage is great! Fresh, delicious and creative. They have excellent vegetarian alternatives too. The cocktails - especially the passionfruit mojito - were super tasty. We were outside on a cold rainy day and they had a pile of fluffy blankets for us. My friends & I had a really lovely evening at Sage last night. We had the degustation & every dish was just exquisite. Customer service here is always on point - the team‚Äôs attention to detail is second to none. The wine list is also excellent, which again, the staff are across & are very knowledgeable on pairing with different dishes. Highly recommend - one of Canberra‚Äôs best!",

        "Place_Reviews": "Italian and Sons: We had high expectations for the restaurant, however the overall experience is pretty disappointing. The steak is not evenly cooked and is definitely not what we asked for‚Äî‚Äîmedium, it‚Äôs over done and tastes like rubber. We didn‚Äôt even have the appetite for dessert. The only delightful course is the focaccia, to be exact, the cream included within the focaccia is tasteful and rich. I expected a little bit more from this restaurant. I was seated at a table near the wall and the place felt a little crammed as there was a person directly behind me, some may call this cosy but the layout could do with some work. I have been at Italian&Sons once. I live in Sydney and rarely travel to Canberra. But what a delightful surprise was Italian&Sons. Being Italian myself and moved to Sydney in 2008 I had experience many 1,2 and 3 Michelin Star around Europe. If we talk just about food and service Italian&Sons is by far the best Italian Restaurant in Australia. Bravo üëè What a great find! My wife booked this place based on reviews and boy it did not disappoint! The service was absolutely incredible, matched by the amazing food. Honestly we can‚Äôt rave about this place enough. Been here a few times now and can highly recommend this restaurant for the experience it provides.",
