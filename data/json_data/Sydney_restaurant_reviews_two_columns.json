        "Place_Reviews": "QT Sydney: Loved this hotel! Quirky and stylish. Great service. Arrived early and the team were helpful, storing our bags all day and having them ready in the room on arrival. The room was larger than any other ‚Äòstandard‚Äô room I‚Äôve had which was nice. Amenities great and bed super comfortable. Love that the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom but the gap in the door meant you could hear and smell‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ everything. Heard plumbing sounds constantly, too so suggest ear plugs. Would definitely stay here again despite these few things. QT Sydney - you have my heart! Trick, tick, tick. Loved our stay at QT. Stunning hotel. Our room was beautiful. Bed was very comfortable. Dyson hairdryer a bonus. Only negatives (small ones), nowhere to hang a hand towel or anything else in the bathroom, and the sound of toilet filling or other plumbing sounds most of the night. Perfect location, quirky art deco style of decor but unfortunately my two week stay was let down by the basics. What an absolutely terrific hotel. To start off the hotel is very hidden but it‚Äôs like a platform 9 and 3 quarters sort of vibe and the whole feel from the reception to the rooms illustrates a hogwarts/out of the ordinary vibe. Loved everything about this hotel.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Sir Stamford at Circular Quay: We booked one of the two rooms o. The 9th floor with a large balcony looking directly into the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. A pleasant stay in a well licated hotel for access to the Ooera House, Circular Quay and selected sights. Great service, lovely historic looking hotel. Room was good though bed was a little uncomfortable. The breakfast was nothing fancy and your typical buffet. Location was great. This is indeed an iconic venue, only minutes from train, bus, and ferry services plus its superb proximity to Sydney's Botanical Gardens and Opera house. The staff are terrific. The breakfast selections equally so. I can not speak highly enough of my joyfull stay, and much of my enjoyment is attributed to the hotel, its location, and what it's got to offer here. Not worth the price paid. Definitely needs an update. Furniture are old & extremely used. Paint peeling off walls & doors. Poor service. Room wasn‚Äôt serviced during the stay & staff made up excuses as to why it wasn‚Äôt done. And even after the service, they left rubbish on the bedside table & floor. Hugely disappointing. Safe to say, won‚Äôt be staying there again.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Stamford Plaza Sydney Airport Hotel & Conference Centre: The hotel is like walking back into the 90s, so it's got that novelty feeling to it. A nice stay very close to the airport. The hotel was generally good, quite clean and well maintained. The beds definitely need to be replaced as they were super bouncy and not the greatest, and the breakfast was mediocre, however for a quick stay to/from the airport, it was good. The regular airport shuttle service was a bonus as it meant we didn't have to worry about making our own arrangements. Last min booking after my flight was cancelled, great price and the room was excellent. Had a very tasty steak in the restaurant and a good value buffet breakfast. Cheap shuttle back to the Airport top of a great stay. 100% recommended. This is a place I won‚Äôt be in a hurry to go back to, invited by a friend to visit the Stamford at Mascot for a few beverages and lite entertainment Saturday night. Enter in a quite pleasant comfortable  English decor bar ordered two beverages reasonably prices paid in cash, consumed them and proceeded to order another round, to my amazement the price had increased question the bar staff on pricing and was advised that due to the unavailability of the house spirit we were given premium. I question and advised the staff member  who served us  a so called supervisor in a jacket that perhaps in the future he should advise guests of the situation rather than take upon himself to mark up and serve a premium product without guest consent. After our encounter I went to pay with cash to my amazement advised that no cash transaction were able due to lack  off change in the float and asked with sheer arrogance to tap not bothering to ask for other forms of payment but forced to tap. Taped away consumed our beverages and  Uber to another venue which I might add made our night. I was very happy with the lighting in the room. They use warm white globes which gives the rooms a warm, cosy feel.",

I didn't pay for the room so can't comment on the price but if I can afford to stay here again I surely will. Room was a standard size (nothing special). Great comfortable bed and bathroom. Standard city views. I love the total blackout blinds and curtains. Gym was too small to be of any use. Pool looked nice but I don't like swimming. Just book it! Our group of 3 searched for a last minute stay in the area (on Vivid weekend) and we were quickly assisted by Jasmine over the phone and at the front desk on arrival. Our stay was top notch from booking to check out. The rooms are spacious, CLEAN. Robes, slippers provided. Daily housekeeping. Breakfast buffet was solid with several options. The entire staff is professional, friendly with good work ethic. The location of the hotel is ideal with close proximity to The Rocks and several train + ferry stops. We enjoyed our stay so much, we decided to stay at the Amora in Brisbane later during our trip. Nice hotel in a good location at a good price point. Not as nice as others I‚Äôve stayed at in Sydney CBD but the price point reflects this well I guess, hence the 4 stars. We stayed for two nights as a getaway for two. The room was clean and spacious with a lovely view over the city. It was easy to change and maintain the temperature and the double doors to the bathroom made me smile every time I had to swan through them! The hotel is a short walk from Wynyard Station and we had no issues walking to food and entertainment venues. Staff we interacted with were lovely and the pool, hot tub and saunas were an amazing end to days of walking. My partner used the gym and said the machines were usable but have not been maintained. All staff were very polite. Great pool/spa area!",

The high class refurbishment  in this hotel has to be seen to be  believed.  Elegant,  contemporary  decor  with a not to art deco era here and there. Gorgeous üòç My weekend stay at Swissotel Sydney was truly exceptional! From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive. The highlight of our stay was the amazing buffet breakfast each morning. The variety and quality of the food were outstanding, catering to all tastes with a delightful selection of fresh fruits, pastries, hot dishes, and more. The hotel's central location is amazing, making it easy to explore the city. Our room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable, providing a perfect retreat after a day of sightseeing. I highly recommend Swissotel Sydney for anyone looking for a luxurious and enjoyable stay in the heart of the city. We'll definitely be back! My husband and I stayed here in November 2023. This place is absolutely amazing to stay. The customer service is outstanding. Everyone was accommodating and was upgraded for our stay. Me and my partner just checked out this morning and had a mixed experience. My family and I stayed here in June 2024. Location is great. Close to good shopping and the park etc. The arrival space is underwhelming at best. The front door is a hole in the wall. When you go up to reception it's nice but I wouldn't say it's anything special. Small. Very small. The service the whole weekend was HORRENDOUS! From the bar staff making the wrong drinks to 2 out of 3 lifts being broken to the waiter taking an hour to ask for our order at dinner then the food came out all mixed up. We stupidly decided to charge our drinks to our room and when we went to check out there were a dozen drinks on our account my husband didn't order! I was checking out while my husband was with the kids so I could only guess how many drinks he had. Now a WEEK LATER they've sent us an email with a bill to pay another $140 for drinks which were not added to our account at the time! They're just a mess. Its too hard. Will not bother staying here again. It's a good location but there are so many other places to choose from for sure. Save your pennies!",

The food is fantastic, although the portions are pretty small. Service was extremely quick and efficient. We finished our 3 course meal in half an hour and was out of there. It's definitely worth the value for French dining. Food is decent for what you pay.

I have always wanted to dine in at this restaurant, but I don‚Äôt why for some reason I never had the chance. Finally, had the chance to visit the place for our anniversary.

Would love to celebrate more special occasions at The Little Snail Haven't been back to Australia since February 2023, I took my mother, misus and daughter for a walk to Darking Harbour. Stumbled pass this place and I just wanted to have a look at the menu, saw Kangaroo which I really want to try while in Australia, but the ladies wanted to go for a walk, after crossing the bridge and the restaurants there did not seem that interesting to us at that time, I just that Kangaroo dish on my mind, so we decided to walk back. Just WOW!!! We went as my son really wanted to try escargot. When we saw the $45 lunch we thought great not to expensive‚Ä¶. The food is AMAZING!!! I‚Äôve paid more at fancier restaurants for less food and lower quality. The service is great too. Happy to eat here again.",

It is easy to be a great place to stay when everything goes well but the real test is when it doesn‚Äôt. On our recent stay 3 out of 4 of our Adults became  very ill. The staff were amazing, any hour of the night we could call Reception for help and whatever we needed they provided. The care and service we got from the staff was exceptional. Thank you Adina Stayed a Monday night in a 2 bed apartment. They‚Äôre tidy and the beds are fantastic. They are very dark, the hotel is very dark and the detail cleaning isn‚Äôt there. The basic cleaning is done and it looks good, but move the foot stool or look at the skirting boards and there‚Äôs dirt and dust. The pool the unit i stay in is clean and spacious, its a 2 bedroom apartment with 2 bathroom which is a plus and full functional kitchen and laundry machine. the interior is a little outdated but it is fine for me. Adina Surry Hills was perfect for my family - location was ideal as we were able to walk to the SCG for the footy, walk to the Art gallery and to lots of cool coffee shops, gelato store, deli etc, as well as being an easy walk for my 4and 6 year olds to the light rail, bus and train into the city and Circular Quay. The pool was a hit with the kids and the staff were great - especially the reception desk lady (wish I caught her name!) working each morning we were there who chatted with the kids, helped with directions, always had a smile and allowed us to leave luggage and use the pool both before check in and after check out. Rooms were very spacious with TVs in each bedroom, great view and really comfy and clean beds. We appreciated having the beds made for us each day and fresh towels delivered! Only downsides were a few kitchen items that would have been good such as peeler and chopping boards, as well as the outdated bathrooms - these need attention as ours had a broken shower head, a toilet that ran, some cracked tiles etc. For the price and the location though, we will definitely be back! I have been staying here for work regularly for about 15 years. The location is unbeatable, and the actual design of the place is very good.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Castlereagh Boutique Hotel: A comfortable and affordable hotel in the CBD. My room was small but well laid out. Housekeeping was very friendly, and the room well-supplied with towels, extra pillows, blankets, etc. The windows are old and a bit drafty, which made the room chilly during my stay (winter‚ÄîJuly); there is AC but no heat. The wifi is very dodgy, disconnecting regularly and so weak that I couldn't use it at times. There is a restaurant on premises but I did not visit it; there are good coffee options in the street immediately outside the hotel. The lifts are perhaps the slowest I've experienced. Overall, an older but comfortable and reasonably-priced hotel in the heart of Sydney. Lovely hotel right in the heart of the CBD with easy access to everything. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. The room itself was nice and clean, a little small, but for the price and location pretty great. Our room was switched after the first night due to the ceiling panel falling down. Luckily we were not in the room at the time.  Reception area is very nice but the rooms are way too small for two people and so are the attached bathrooms.  The rooms are well furnished, perhaps causing them to be cramped. Room service was good. Location is ideal and walking distance to most places. When my partner suggested we stay here, I was a little let down(I know better than to judge a book by its cover)However I can assure you, this is truly one of the most understated hotels,i have stayed at. I had a terrible experience at this hotel. When I arrived at 3:30 p.m., the receptionist, Cindy, who was not fluent in English, was extremely rude and had a noticeable attitude. Despite having a confirmed booking through their website, she told me I would have to wait up to two hours for it to be processed and didn‚Äôt offer any alternatives. She told me to wait and then answered the phone without acknowledging me.",

Our pizza was disappointing - lots of cheese and not much else. Serves were generous. Great location, location/views great, food was good‚Ä¶ heater way too hot/unpleasant inside staff said they couldn‚Äôt fix it.

Lucky 11am checkout so we could sleep in at least. Mixed feelings about this one, service was on point! The rooms were clean, spacey and cozy, but very noisy, if you're a person who cannot sleep through noise, wouldn't recommend it. The location is great as the beach is across from the hotel, the pub is connected and all the shops and restaurants are walking distance but there is no carpark for hotel customers so you're looking at 80+ overnight plus the extra hours.",

Bathrooms in particular used shower+baths which I don‚Äôt live. Water pressure not great. But comfy bed and spacious rooms. Stayed in the city with a group of girlfriends after seeing Chicago at the Capitol Theatre and the Vibe Hotel was in the perfect location; walking distance from both the theatre and Central Station, as well as a number of great restaurants. The room was setup for old people who needed assistance, the toilet had guards on which did not alow you to sit on properly. The shower had that many hand rails on, not very good at all. We asked for another room which we got and were promised our bags would be delivered. Got back that night our bags were not there. Service and management were rubbish for a 4 star. Don't know how they get 4 stars My partner and I arrived by the overnight train from Melbourne which was a saga in itself, and the first taxi we asked to take us to this hotel said it was too close for him to drive to... so we shlepped ourselves and our luggage up the hill to the Vibe Hotel - but it was worth it. We stayed in 5 hotels in 5 cities and this was by far my favorite. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on.

The bathroom door hinges have rust, the outside of the bathroom garbage bin was rusty, and the shower had clearly not been cleaned properly. The only positive feedback I can give is that the staff were lovely and helpful. As for the room, it was overpriced for something that wasn't looked after and maintained. The room at Travelodge was excellent for the price we paid. We initially were disappointed that we got a queen bed because we indicated in our booking that we wanted two single beds, but after returning from dinner on the first day, there were 2 single beds! The service was excellent and consistent. The front desk staff always greeted us and were very helpful. The room was big enough for the two of us, and the toilet was nice as well. The location of the hotel was superb - we were able to walk to almost anywhere we wanted to go to in the area - Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, Town Hall, Botanical Gardens, etc. It was very conveniently located in the centre of many of the attractions, and there were also many restaurants located nearby. It was also right beside Wynyard train station, which was very convenient when traveling to and from the airport. Room size and location is great.

I would have appreciated a lower price for my meal if that was going to the case. Such a beautiful place, the view is amazing. You can see the whole city throughout your dining.

It is centrally located in The Rocks historic district, priced low, and offers lots of atmosphere from their own two historic buildings.  That should have earned it 5 stars from me.  But it earned barely 3 stars from my wife due to several things.  It was badly in need of a vacuuming when we arrived, but the management was unable to vacuum until the next day.  They did not even have an on-site vacuum cleaner that we could use ourselves(?!)  Another thing was that the bathroom was out-of-suite and rather dated; although not shared it was not private.  Another item for both of us was the poorly connected in-room air-conditioning ducting and seal to the outdoors.  A very cool place to stay for people with less expectations, but not so much for seasoned travelers used to pristine accommodations. Not good at all! The location is excellent for the price, and the staff are very accommodating. There's no elevator, so be prepared for a few stairs. The rooms are a bit dated, but they are clean and comfortable. Shared bathrooms, but this is common in the area. The bathrooms are also very clean and spacious. Breakfast was fantastic, as you are given an all you can eat wide selection from fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, roasted potatoes, cereal, bagels, and other food items. My only complaint is that it can be a bit difficult to find, as it's located up off of the street level and only has a small sign that's hard to see. Fantastic experience overall and would definitely recommend to those looking for a bit more peace, quiet, and comfort in the Rocks area. Location is excellent but that‚Äôs all it has going for it.

Friends and I stay here every time we‚Äôre in Sydney. Prices are awesome and the rooms are super good for the price. Brooke was super nice at check out! :) Would 100% recommend this hostel. Location is perfect. The staff are always so helpful and they go above and beyond. Big shout out to Josh and Laura, they have been amazing! : Don‚Äôt go there if you wanna get some sleep. There‚Äôs a restaurant/bar that turns into a club from 9pm to 2 am into the same building. I was there from wednesday to saturday, same thing every night. I was in room 215, the bed was shaking due to the bass music downstairs. Maybe the owners should try a night in their own establishment, they‚Äôd understand. Mold on the ceiling of shower. Good location though and bed confortable!",

        "Place_Reviews": "Burwood Bed and Breakfast: Had a pleasant experience. Not too sure what is up with all the negative reviews but I had a nice time here. Location was great. Very close to the shops and station. Room was clean but a little small but understandable. Dirty public shared toilet AND SHOWER shared between 15 to 20 rooms. No door on bathroom even. Chat place stains on the walls and desk they only bother cleaning and maintaining the expensive rooms that they advertise, no microwave no kettle no utensils nothing but a fridge and bed. Internet is too slow to be anything functional and worst of all, junkies everywhere and they're noisy. Worst place I have ever stayed by a long long margin. Rude receptionist made me wait outside for an hour and a half before serving me. So, on the 5th of April, my girlfriend and I were kinda tired of the same old scene at home and decided we needed a little escape. We didn't want to break the bank, especially in a place like Sydney, so we ended up booking a night at Burwood Bed and Breakfast, thinking, Hey, it's under 100 bucks, let's keep those expectations in check. But, you know what? It was actually pretty great. The room gave us exactly what we needed ‚Äì a clean spot to crash, a comfy bed, and some peace and quiet. It's not like we were looking for five-star luxury with this price tag, but the essentials? Spot on. Plus, everything was neat and tidy, which honestly was all we were hoping for.The folks running the place were super chill too. Really friendly and more than happy to help out with tips about the area, making our little Sydney getaway even better. I work for a small charity. We paid over $500 in advance for a room for a whole weekend thinking a homeless person had somewhere safe to sleep over the weekend. We were to find out later the person was sent away for not having enough ID. We contacted the vendor to be told that‚Äôs just too bad and they had sold the room to another person and there were to be no refunds. So basically the charity I work for lost $500 and a homeless person slept on the street all weekend. Very sad and unfortunate situation. Have worked in homeless services for many years and have never had an issue like this. Awesome old house perfect for a stop over for events. Close walk to trains, great food, pubs, and Burwood china time.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Travelodge Hotel Macquarie North Ryde Sydney: Stayed here recently for two nights while hubby had an operation at the nearby hospital.  Room was a reasonable size, clean and tidy with a comfortable bed and all the amenities we required. Breakfast offered a good tasty fare but we found the choices for dinner were lacking in quality and over priced. However the bar was a bonus. Happy to say that the staff were all friendly,  efficient and helpful. Thanks for making our stay pleasant. Clean, well-priced room with friendly staff. We were literally a 2 minute walk from the Macquarie University Hospital and a 2 minute drive from the shopping mall. If you or your loved ones are at the hospital, this is the perfect place to stay.  Found a great deal booking online. Parking is extra but the reception let us leave our car there long after check out. Buffet breakfast was very decent. If I found myself in the area again I would definitely stay here a second time. Overall good experience. A couple of things which matters. I was staying for 15 days and the toiletries were of same fragrance. The phone ring is so low that I could hardly hear the morning wake up call given by the receptionist. Though they provide room service, they do very nice bedding. But I hardly saw any vacuum clean up of the room. Since I was there for longer, my room became very dusty. I stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to the university where I was attending a conference. Before arriving I thought that it was rather expensive for Travelodge, but I figured it must be updated in some way and they did have a monopoly close to the university. However, I have been totally underwhelmed by the experience. The lobby does seem updated, But the rooms are dated. There's no place to plug your phone in close to the bed and so it has to be across the room. The bathroom was not very clean when I checked in including hair in the shower. this problem is exasperated because they did not clean my room the first night I've been here. This was after I specifically asked the cleaning staff to clean my room. The front desk staff has been incredibly Pleasant and professional. However, they seem continuously overworked and understaffed. The bar did not open at all on Saturday night, and is open but unstaffed tonight. there's a brand-new Holiday Inn around the corner and I'd highly recommend staying there as opposed to this Travelodge. Clean room linen and towels.",

Ordered creamy Tom yum prawn soup, portion was big and tasty but a bit salty and should contained msg because I was very thirsty afterwards and had to keep drinking water. Stir fry chicken flat noodles was quite nice but chicken was dry and tough, maybe other meat would be better. We ordered three dishes and did have a second bite of the papaya salad. The crab was sooo fishy and bitter, destroying the whole. Do NOT order papaya salad if you still want to go there. Actually I have no idea why there is always crowded in the restaurant. I‚Äôve dined here a few times and am very happy with the quality of the food. Recently I ordered the blended choc drink which was well flavoured. One of the best stop for Thai food and perfectly fits in for the people who is craving for spicy food. Must try place One of the better Thai restaurants in the area.

Didn't stay overnight or in any of the rooms but the dining area was clean enough even if the table was a bit sticky. Service not bad from the young lass and the kitchen lads. Location superb next to Central station. The values for money outweigh any negative reviews on noise. Sure the tram rattles past but not all night. There is a 24hour bar across the street, the noise was minimal. I did stay on a Sunday night though. Rude, meat-head security guards. Tried to get in to have a couple of beers after the races last Saturday with a group of blokes, 3 aged over 60, 1 bloke in his 80‚Äôs. Just a quiet, friendly small group. Got spoken to rudely at the door and refused. Fine, we didn‚Äôt argue. Security then radioed the pub across the street to not let us in there either. Thanks heaps mate. There are two pasta dishes on the menu. I ordered one, (taglitelle boscaiola) and when I ordered at the bar, I was told that there was no pasta. Not one stick in the whole place. This was at 5pm, just as the kitchen opened, so it was obvious that no one took the initiative to do re-stocks that day. And it was plain that there was no one around the place in charge. I'm sticking with the Crystal Place where they take an active interest in providing pub grub. Popular pub near Central and a good first stop walking to SFS/SCG.

The flavours, in these dishes are exquisite and very generous and the naan. Oh my naan the best ever. Also the prices are so good. I never used to enjoy this cuisine and then this place changed everything for me. I'm so glad. This place is a must try. It's also halal and there are also vegan options and also vegetarian options. From the entrees to dessert you will go on a flavorsome journey you will never forget and you will mark this as a favorite.I'm always coming back for more. This place is terrific. We eat a lot of Indian food and it's definitely up with the best we've had in Sydney. The service was really excellent - friendly, professional and attentive - and there's a good wine selection by the glass. Highlights were the lamb korma and the lemon thyme tandoori prawn. On the list to go back. Went here for a friend's birthday. We are both vegan and whilst a lot of the menu has meat on it, there are quite a few vegan options and a few more that can be made vegan on request. Delhi 'O' Delhi is one of the few occasions where we have disagreed in our time reviewing restaurants. While Sam enjoyed her samosas, butter chicken and mango lassi, I found the dishes to be lacking in flavour (including the highly recommended Kachoria entree and camel curry main). Good atmosphere and the curries have addictive flavours. Would highly recommend the lemon rice.",

We waited a few minutes, I went again to ask if we could sit and he said he would let us know when we could have a table.  We gave up the table and the place.  I have never seen a customer treated so badly. I had a lovely meal here at George's. The service was great. Food quality and presentation was excellent. Well done!!

The Lamb and gravy dish was extremely hard to saw through the meat.  I did not get to try the chicken main.

Service was faultless, our steaks were cooked to perfection, the red wine jus was superb, wines exceptional, and our wonderful waiter/host (we regret that we forgot to get his name) could not do enough for us.

My family and I ordered the Australian Wagyu Beef and Kangaroo Meat. Firstly, the location of the restaurant near Darling Harbour offers a beautiful view. However, the quality and taste of the food were completely unacceptable. I couldn't believe that the Wagyu Beef was covered with black grill marks. I ordered the Wagyu Beef medium rare, but the surface was burnt, tasted bitter, and the meat was tough and difficult to chew. As a tourist from Asia who has enjoyed authentic Wagyu in Australia, I reasonably suspect that the Wagyu served here is not genuine. Alternatively, the restaurant might have thought that since we were tourists and unlikely to return, they could serve us subpar food. It‚Äôs great when you find a restaurant with great staff. It‚Äôs great when you find a restaurant with exceptional food. When you get both it‚Äôs wonderful. Jack your a gem. Sorry I didn‚Äôt get a pic of the ribs at the start only after I devoured them!

Fish portions were a little small, with most of the plate taken up by the salad. Had food envy with my friend's fish tacos, which were much cheaper and looked better than mine lol. It pains me to have to write this review as I fond memories of this place. Firstly I was at the legendary Green Day secret show here in 2011 (?)- and  a mate of mine used to live across the street so we had some fun nights drinking schooners and playing Big Buck Hunter. Man this place has really taken a dive under new ownership. Extremely rude bar staff, food took over an hour for a chicken wrap because they had two people working out back on a Saturday, and they had the nerve to make out like I was being rude for asking where it was. They have a Saturday Burger and Beer special that isn‚Äôt available on game day (even though they are next to a stadium where sport is always on) but on Saturday there was no game on, yet the special wasn‚Äôt available because of the Pink Concert. A concert is a game now? Food was awful, they were out of a few ingredients, no salsa for the tacos, and the bread was stale. This once great pub has been gutted because they know they‚Äôll always have overflow from sports stadium next door. Do yourself a favour and go to one of the other, much better, pubs nearby It's not going to wow your socks off, pretty typical pub. But the beers are cold and there's quite a bit of indoor seating so... Called in to the Captain Cook before the Pink concert to have a cocktail. They weren‚Äôt serving cocktails because they were ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù. They weren‚Äôt that busy. They would have been busier had they been serving cocktails.

The steaks were also cooked to perfection and so juicy and easy to eat. Perhaps the most underrated dish was the Morton bag pasta noodles, it was cooked to perfection and had a delicious tangy flavour that made it so enjoyable. We booked a table for two at 6pm. At 8pm, the waiter brought us the bill and informed us of the two-hour limit, which we understand. However, our dessert took about 20 minutes to arrive, making us feel rushed, especially since it was my partner‚Äôs birthday. We also noticed that another group, who had been there longer, was not asked to leave. Initially, I thought it was because they were a larger group, but the confirmation email stated that all reservations are for a period of two hours. After being informed and paying the bill, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed, fearing someone would come and force us to leave. We hurriedly finished our drinks and dessert, but seeing the next table happily chatting and drinking felt inconsistent and unfair. My partner even had to hold her little birthday cupcake and finish it on the street because there was no time to finish before we left. She was almost crying on our way home, asking why we have to be treated like this, especially on her birthday. The whole experience was traumatic.

Saltimbocca which is commonly veal turned out to be compressed chicken. Sorry to say food was bland using low quality ingredients and not seemingly Italian other than in name.

Very reasonably priced. Staff is always really prompt, kind and helpful. Highly recommend. Restaurant + Food + Overall Feeling: A simple, humble and traditional place to dine in.

There is an aromatic smell when you walk inside, like walking inside your grandma‚Äôs kitchen. It‚Äôs a mouthwatering waft of Italian flavours such as garlic and herbs. Either way, it smells delicious and you instantly feel hungry (if you weren‚Äôt earlier), I am very excited about what lies ahead of me on the plate. Now the name says it all. Its food made with Love. The restaurant offered Italian food and pizza. Its set on the main road, so you will need to find parking in the side streets or behind.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Tandoori Hut Newtown: Best food in town While the decor may be somewhat austere, the food is great: Tender and flavoursome. My wife said it's one the best Butter chickens she's had. I had the Bombay beef which was really tender and tasty. We went with a group of six, and had a great time all round! The food was delicious and surprisingly affordable. Tandoori chicken definitely had a spicier kick than we were used to, but god it was delicious. This is good honest Indian and Pakistani food. There's no fancy frills and decor here. All their effort is put in their cooking and the food is sensational. Service is not stuffy, just efficient, which is all you need when you're in search of good food. Judging by the fact your fellow diners will usually be from the sub-continent, then you know you're in a proper curry house. Tandoori hut provides the best indian food in the area. Their butter chicken is out of this world. The venue is overdue for a revamp and would be one of the most popular places on Enmore road if they spruced the place up a bit. But, we love it, we still go and we can always get a table, even on a busy saturday night. Keep it up.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Castle Taj Indian Tandoori Restaurant | Best Indian Restaurant in Sydney: We visited for dinner. Food was good. The place is pretty big. The veggie platter was good. It helps you taste all the starters. Veg dum biryani was good too. Service was good too. The chef cooked the noodles less spicy for kids. They have outdoor seatings too. Toilets were well maintained. The place is accessible outdoor seating, forgot at the entry if there was a step. Castle Taj has a decent ambie ce, staff is very courteous and food is amazing. First time eating in after many take outs. My husband and I relocated from Gold Coast yesterday and were looking for an authentic Indian restaurant to dine in. A salesperson recommended this restaurant to us. Honestly, we were blown away by the food and par excellence service. We had biryani which was very tasty and the amritsari fish was top notch. Their sauces are probably one of the best we have tried. Sumit, the owner‚Äôs service is exceptional. He immediately helped us by giving us valuable tips on how to navigate our way in Sydney given that we‚Äôre newcomers. We‚Äôre very appreciative of his kindness. Thank you for giving us such a wonderful experience. The papadums were more like stale prawn crackers without any taste. The cheese & garlic naan were doughy & rubbery. They gave me a Diet Coke instead of Coke Zero & when I called about it the person working there was rude & said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre the same thing‚Äù.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Spice I Am: Service and atmosphere were good. The flavour of the food is fine not outstanding. The servings are very small. Among other things we had a whole snapper which was so tiny we felt terrible for the poor little fish that should have been thrown back in. Do not order the fish! You know something is good when you crave a particular dish from a particular place. I love stopping by here after work, or on the weekend with friends. In fact I‚Äôll find any excuse to dine here because it is SO good. I‚Äôve been over 10 times this year. It‚Äôs reliable, tasty, fresh and fast. Never change! Actually, I often pass through this area, but this restaurant is too dark to be recognized. The food is delicious and the service is good, and for the price in this city area, it‚Äôs relatively cheap and the portions are generous. We were recommended and on the basis of the food, I am glad we went. I think the service is okay and the dish comes very quickly. Lunch special menu is affordable and yummy - though I thought my kra prao would come with minced pork‚Ä¶ I may come here for work lunch again to try something else on the menu",

I stumbled upon this restaurant when I was meeting a friend who works for AusGrid,  which just happens to be in the same building as this restaurant. We decided to sit down for coffee. First impression was how clean and bright this restaurant is and first class friendly staff. Coffee was nicely prepared and taste awesome. There are so many choices for coffee style but not overwhelming. You can get small dishes to share with great varieties of sandwiches and wraps to choose from. Lovely selection of delicious cakes as well. A hidden gem I might add. The Capitol Theatre is right across from here and also a short stroll to Paddy's Market and World Square shopping centre. There's a wheelchair accessible entrance here. I'm not sure if there's a lavatory here as I didn't ask. If you are looking for down to earth services with great coffee and relaxing ambience then this is a great place to visit. It is good for quick snacks. I love this place Very good cafe and great service Ausgrid head office, great place to work",

From reading the reviews after, yep silly me it goes to show they don't give 2 S..ts. live and learn. P.s don't order domino's either you get burnt bugs instead of metal objects! WOW!!  Best pizza we've had in a very very long time.   Staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Can't recommend Forest Wood Fire enough.  So tasty, with a good balance of flavours . Well definitely be back! Pizza was ok, better than your chain restaurants like dominos and pizza hut. Nutella pizza was dissapointing, I was expecting similar to the photo with icing sugar and strawberries but this was all we got. Ordered a Gluten free pizza was a big disappointment. Paid $30 and the base was burnt and horrible. Got a Mykonos Woodfired the base was perfectly crunchy tasty pizza very friendly service well done guys",

The loaded schnitzel, rump steak, and kids' cheeseburger were all delicious and generously portioned. Terrible staff attitude from Jordan. Although I love this place, great food, great location, I will never go back in case she is on duty again. Accused us of talking about her appearance in a negative way which was a total lie. When not serving she was sitting customer side with her feet up on the table. Shocking attitude. Food average.   Nice clean bar. Staff rather unfriendly.   If you're close, it's worth a visit.

This local Vietnamese restaurant has become my go-to place for some good, steamy ph√≤, especially on a cold day. We ordered rare beef pho, seafood laksa, spring rolls and rice paper rolls. I was not very impressed with the pho broth, it was bland. The laksa broth was more flavorful but I found it average on the scale of laksa broths. The spring rolls were small and had very little filling in them. Overall a fine place for a quick lunch. Cannot rave enough about Da Lat. We have been to a number of Sydney‚Äôs Vietnamese restaurants, and the Ph√¥ here is the best (IMO). I‚Äôm here right now and the place is packed. The owners are super friendly as well. Love it!",

The food was good. The staff were friendly. I think is an ok place for a quick meal with the family. I think whoever is running the place needs to pay more attention to simple things like not having chipped plates given to patrons. We had out of 6 plates 4 were chipped! The food came quick enough which is great when you have little kids hungry. The noodles were a little over cooked but the bbq chicken and the stir fried beef were nice. Always go here on my way down from Newcastle and it always delivers! Delicious Thai food, large portions and good service. Food comes out quickly too! Our favourite is the crispy pork belly stir fry. Highly recommend! My partner has already posted photos of the chicken skewers we received. Never in my life have I ever been served a chicken skewer that small. It was literally 1 bite & done. I understand the cost of living & food cost increases, but the portion size was just plain rude. Green curry with tofu had a total of 3 pieces of tofu cut in half, making it 6. The pad thai with crispy pork was really good. Overall a very disappointing experience.",

Lovely wine list and beautiful little touches everywhere, from little strawberries on the edge of the bubbles glass, to lap blankets on the back of our chairs - just in case we wanted them (but the outdoor heaters were well enough). Thanks for such a memorable experience team! We loved every minute and highly recommend your fabulous establishment. Food is of good taste . Beef skewer, chicken pasta,  pizza  and parmesan were very tasty. Natalie was our server and she was the best waitress I have ever experienced. She made the environment feel very warm, comfortable and accommodating. She made it special for my mum‚Äôs wedding anniversary that she celebrated without her husband since he was working and spent it with me (her daughter) instead. The food was superb and once again the entire service was amazing. I highly recommend this place!!! We order the grilled seafood platter for one. The squid was excellent as was the other seafood. The fatoush salad that came with it paired well with the seafood. It was just a little bit salty. The pear and rocket salad was a little too sweet but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The prawn pasta was very good too. Simple and went well with everything we ordered. By the way, Gerald and team looking after us were super nice and friendly. Such amazing food and service. SO SO MANY GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS our Waiter Mayanic was fabulous. This was our 3 rd night here and consistently great. We will be back. Please come open a restaurant in Melbourne",
