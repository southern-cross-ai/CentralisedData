        "Place_Reviews": "Travelodge Resort Darwin: Great location. The hotel feels full of demotivated staff, unfortunately. We had mould in the bottom of our kettle when we arrived, and the safe battery was flat; that kind of set the tone for our stay. It feels like a hotel that needs some leadership The staff were lovely, but unfortunately that’s where the quality of this resort ended. There was a dead lizard in our shower covered in ants, toilet wouldn’t flush properly, kettle didn’t work, barely any drinks on the pool menu were available & we heard somebody at 3am trying to break in through our sliding door. The loud & dirty rooms were certainly not worth the price. Would stay here again. The Room was clean and comfortable with good bedding and good air-conditioning. Bathroom was clean and tidy with great water pressure. Hotel staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel had 2 large outdoor pools , one underneath shade cloth that was cooler water temperature. Hotel has parking that you need to pay for, walking distance to town center. Breakfast is provided with an extra charge is was a buffet style of Continental or hot cooked breakfast Really comfortable beds. Showers are nice and relaxing. People are nice. It’s easy to fall asleep because how comfortable the beds are. The pools are very clean. The TVs work fine. It is very hard to get out of bed in the morning. Lots to see out the window. Very calm and relaxing place to be. Rooms were clean and pleasant. Staff were friendly but not very informative about places to eat in the area. The restaurant is only open for breakfast, and the pool bar menu is very limited. There is also no in-house dining option on a Sunday evening.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Vibe Hotel Darwin Waterfront: We stayed here for two nights, it was pleasant to see all the Indigenous art in the foyer, which had a strong perfume smell, and carried through to the hallways leading to the rooms. When we got into the room, it was very small for the price and the room had a thick smell of mould, but we expected it for the wet season humidity. The staff were very happy to serve us, and we told them about it after our stay. Loved loved loved the Waterfront to death and would come again. Location is the best in Darwin . Hotel is surrounded by restaurants and the wave pool plus the water terrain park. Great for families . Room service was very disappointing. Be careful . Ordered the club sandwich and you can see by pictures it’s a club sandwich at a “different level.”  On checkout showed pictures of the “special club sandwich “ to reception staff….couldn’t give a rats…$22 dollars plus a $4 tray service . Maybe an off day in the kitchen but….really ? You serve this as a club sandwich ? The waterfront rooms are very noisy, with music from downstairs cafes and festivals. Worst if all was the water aerobic instructor in the wave pool, yelling (although she was mic'd up) to her class at 8am Sunday morning. Beyond hotel control, I guess, but awful. We booked this hotel months ago and paid the extra price (over $400 per night) for a room with a view. The description of these premium rooms state “ water view” and the room images support this. Arriving in the dark, it wasn’t until this morning ,that we opened the curtains to a view of the  roof of the restaurant below us and trees. When I checked with reception to see if there had been a mistake in our room type  I was told “ technically it does have a view - of a park and if you stand in the corner you can see some water” Nice rooms in an excellent location but you can see that the building has been there a while. Plenty of eating and drinking options on the covered esplanade below make it easy to enjoy relaxing there. Water sports are also well catered for with a wave pool and water park literally right at the back door. An easy 10 minute walk from the CBD.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Hanuman Restaurant Darwin: We enjoyed a very special meal at Hanuman. Hanuman has a very good reputation as one of the best restaurants in Darwin. Before Tonight we had tried 2 of the best known South East Asian Restaurants in Darwin, one was Vietnamese Chinese Malay fusion restaurant and the other one was Srilankan Thai. So tonight we tried Hanuman as the Thai Indian Restaurant  and this time we were not disappointed, in fact the food was very good, the chicken Briani was very tasty with a bit of spiciness  The service was excellent, especially the waitress named Nita from Indonesia was exceptional, she was very friendly, always smiling and her recommendations were all very good. A pity that we have limited small asian stomach capacity, so that we just ordered 2 appetisers and chicken Briani as main course. All 3 dishes were very good and tasty. When in Darwin the Hanuman is very recommended not to be missed. Last but not least the price was reasonable. I have been coming to Hanumans for years now, and while I no longer live in Darwin, it is a must visit when I'm in town, as it is easily one of the best restaurants in town! A magnificent culinary experience in the heart of Darwin. Congratulations to the Hanuman team. A big shout out to Sam our wait staff.  She was attentive and provided delightful service. Had an amazing time here! Everything from the food, atmosphere and our server Natasha was absolutely amazing! The mango Daiquiri was 10/10 and will definitely be back!",

The rooms and beds are good with regular room service, and it's right next to a beautiful bushwalk and beach. The staff are helpful and friendly.  The pool is pretty chlorinated but made for a great swim and the grounds are nicely maintained. We recently stayed here and found the resort to be clean and well maintained. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. Good, simple, nice room. Was good for what we wanted which was not to be in town. Safe too. Enjoyed our time here. Lost a star because the room had a lot of little cricket bugs, looks like they came under the door. Perfect location, great service,  big rooms loved everything about this place.  The staff are very friendly and some of the best I have come across.  They also have great conference facilities and their food is generous and delicious. This was my second time staying at Club Tropical Resort and I will definitely come back again. Loved it. The housekeeping staff is incredibly rude and will often make you clean your own room. If you ask for clean towels, they get angry at you and refuse to give them to you. They make up lies to avoid to clean your room and make up random rules to give excuses.  Rooms are extremely dirty and have ants everywhere.",

The flavors are good, the ambiance spacious, clean, and inviting, and the service is prompt and friendly. Great breezy balcony under the trees, rare beef pho excellent, and chicken pho good. Silky noodles & delicious stock. Extensive menu, very popular lunch time venu. Great \" Asian \" food. The restaurant is billed as Vietnamese but also serves great Thai dishes. I definitely recommend the Red Duck  curry. Tamarind prawns also very good... Ruby Vietnamese Restaurant truly impressed with its authentic flavors and charming ambiance. The crispy beef was cooked to perfection, with a delightful contrast between the tender meat and the crispy coating. The salty fish fried rice was an explosion of flavors, perfectly balancing the savory notes of the fish with the freshness of the vegetables. The service was attentive and friendly, adding to the overall enjoyable experience. I will definitely be returning to Ruby Vietnamese Restaurant to sample more of their delicious dishes. The Ruby's Pho was delicious.  A  flavoursome broth.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Mindil Beach Casino Resort: Stayed here during a quick solo trip up to Darwin. Room we had was just OK as it's a bit dated and didn't really take full advantage of the beach views. Here's another hotel living off its position. My room wasn’t 4-star or luxury: it was basic, dated and in need of a good makeover. Housekeeping was shockingly poor and unreliable: no service at all on day 2, then 3 days of no servicing until I requested it mid-afternoon (when, instead of unwinding, I had to vacate my room again). At nearly $300 per night, I expect better. Surely one of the greatest accomodation. Room was clean and equipped with all basic amenities. The report has an infinity pool which is quite large and extremely good. Gym was nice as well for a workout. Casino next door along with many restaurants providing options for the food. Spa available in the resort. Cleaning was completed daily. Little balcony with the room was a great add-on. I found the price to be quite amazing for this 5 star resort. This review is based on the hotel - absolutely not a 5 star hotel/resort. Rooms are very basic. You can hear everything from the rooms above and beside you. Had to call to have my room cleaned, trays from room service left in the halls all day. Service was friendly and the pools are nice, but definitely not to resort standards.",

The room was spacious, TV had easy connectivity to streaming apps which was great for a 4 night stay, pool was amazing with a relaxing spa! Buffet and restaurant food was great quality. My first night stay, was very noisy at night and I found it difficult to sleep, however the staff were so helpful and offered me a different room for the remainder of my stay. After that my stay was great. Will definitely come back! Our taxi driver from the airport suggested the Adina was the best place to stay in Darwin. We think he is correct. Located on the Darwin Waterfront area. Plenty of dining choices a short walk away. And overlooks waterfront swimming lagoon. Great for the kids. Breakfasts & dinners are good. Great hotel. Quiet at night. Well air conditioned. Would be nice if they had one more staff member to assist in the morning (they only had one person on answering calls and assisting with check-outs). My holiday started monday 18 March and left late in the afternoon 30 March, 13 days of relaxing, touring, a Sunset Champagne dinner Cruise etc. I had a very nice room, a nice bathroom and fantastic views of a wave pool, harbour/Ocean. Situation was good.. many nuce restaurants to choose from but I stayed in the Hotel for breakfast was good and sufficient and very nice and friendly service. I can't fault them, room service was good, Stephan the duty manager even put a nice card in my room with bottles water. The indo I r pool was nice and I was there nearly every day, having cocktails and icecreams from the bar or wine and lunch 👍I could have stayed longer.. I had a fantastic holiday and want to go back one day soon Absolutely top notch. From location to amenities, Adina is a winner. Stayed for a conference at the Darwin Conference Centre and couldn't be happier. The nearby wave pool was also a great treat.",

Paid quite a bit of money for the family villa - wanting a nicer stay. The room was in a terrible condition, however. It was evident the air conditioners had not been cleaned in a long time; mould was visible & the villa had an ant problem. Loved our stay here. Sunday was a roast dinner night and it was so very good!  The meat was sensational. We have just had our wedding at FreeSpirit Resort in July, 2024 and my now husband and I simply can’t thank the team enough or recommend the venue enough. A special mention to Jewel who supported us through the entire planning process and were there for everything along the way. She was responsive to emails, happy to have a meeting whenever and took our suggestions but somehow made them better and offered insightful advice and practical solutions to any mishap. Jewel was the backbone to our wedding and we can’t thank her enough for her help and hard work! Great place, helpful staff. No complaints staff went above and beyond in many ways. Disability access room used. Micro wave could be knee high. Bump in door could be better. Pathways to restaurant would be great. However price was adjusted to fit, staff delivered food to participant in wheelchair. Cleaners were polite and appreciated a bit of a chat. Office staff were amazingly helpful. Great place.

The food was all reasonably priced with a great casual and friendly atmosphere. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great fusion meal, but a tip is to only order 2 mains as the meals are very large. 9.5/10 The best place in town! Been here a few times during my stay in Darwin and every time enjoyed excellent food, friendly service and an amazing atmosphere. My only complaint is that I had to look for other places to eat on Sunday and Monday when Tim's was closed. Oh well, everyone deserves a time off, even the best of us. Seated outside - really nice ambience. Amazing. The Crocodile Schnitzel was unreal, steak was perfectly cooked, huge portions and well priced. Staff were great, awesome atmosphere.

Certain staff just seem like they could care less about the customers and on occasions are clearly intoxicated! There has been times we have been overcharged or charged completely different prices from the times where we have been before. At first I really enjoyed coming here as like I said before the food is very good but it's not worth it anymore as I feel the bar staff completely ruin the environment! Astonishing space in a former movie theatre on Darwin’s party strip Mitchell Street that emphasizes the relaxed feeling of being in the tropics. Had some of my favourite meals and funniest nights in Australia here. The drinks are cold and the staff are warm. Patrons are a mix of gregarious, hilarious locals, expats with unusual life stories, and backpackers who often fall in love with Darwin and make it their long term home. I always have the best time at Monsoons! The new renovations look amazing! went in and was lucky enough to be served by the smiley venue manager Freddie. Made us feel very welcome, tacos and wings were delish- can’t wait to come back! Been here a couple years but love the new set up at Monnie's now.

The only small thing I can fault is that it was a little too dark and therefore it was difficult to read the menu. But that's minor. I would definitely return and recommend to others.

I asked for extra operator as there were a few people queueing. Took a long time. Eventually two came on but by then they had closed the first two down! No doubt staff are instructed not to hurry putting operators on as customers give up waiting and head to self service, very tricky. Not on Woollies, Not on. Customers with a trolley of groceries, old people, young mothers with babies, people with a disability that might not be entirely obvious ( I have only 50% use of one of my arms) should not be made to beg for service. Up your game. We pay enough for our groceries, not paid to work there. Carparking better but not great. There is a carpark security person who is an absolute tool. Doesnt listen and virtually assaulted patrons  in their cars. Loads of complaints about him. He'd employed by the property manager not woolworths. He seems to enforce a no shoes no entry rule. How bizarre when your in the tropics, a racist policy targeting black people. Woollies is a good shopping experience,  products are easily found.

Unsure if staff new, or a once off - but cheese garlic bread had no cheese on it, and the BBQ Meatlovers pizza had not toppings on half the Pizza. ironically three of the pieces of the Pizza had nothing but cheese on it, so apparently the cheese moved from the garlic bread to the Pizza. The Pizza also tasted strange and it took me a few minutes to work it out - there is either no BBQ sauce on the BBQ Meatlovers, or they have used the standard Pizza sauce. Every time i order from the uber eats app, the food never arrives on time. When i try reaching them out the customer service always says that we are very busy, if you guys are really busy either get more hands for work or put your app on a busy mode where we as customer can see that you guys are busy atm. Communication is so much better than just making excuses. Got a pizza here no problem friendly staff food easily met my needs Awesome customer service and friendly staff. Never messes the order up.

The restaurant even offers a curated wine list featuring rare vintages to complement your meal. In a world where fine dining has been redefined, McDonald's has set a new standard with their 5 Michelin star establishment, proving that luxury and fast food can indeed coexist in perfect harmony.

When I entered, I saw a   subway representative inspecting the store. He had a temperature sensor and was measuring the temperature of the cold meats, and salad bar. He also checked the cleanliness of the soft drink nozzles. He did more quality and safety checks but I was too busy enjoying my subway sandwich with my mother. Seeing this, I have good confidence that subway cares about their food safety, especially by visiting a store in Darwin, which is far away from corporate office.

They were very quick to serve us and the waiter had a great memory as he remembered 8 drinks at a time. The food was delicious. The toilets are not for disabled people, as not very wide and a step to get in. They had round tables for big groups, so you could talk to everyone. I found it a little expensive ( but isn't everything these days). We will definitely be going back again. I highly recommend the Prawn spring rolls and the sizzling Mongolian Lamb. This place was recommended and it did not disappoint. Big servings, delicious food, lots of menu options. I recommend ordering a variety and taking leftovers home. Highly recommend the Mongolian Lamb, salt n pepper squid, and the tofu and mixed mushrooms. Update: I've removed some stars because the most recent time that I visited Noodle House left me not wanting to come back ever again. We waited exactly 35mins at our table and not a single waiter/waitress took our order, they didnt even walk past us or make eye contact. We had reserved a table, and there were about 6 tables around us with people frustrated that their orders weren't being taken either. We sat at the tables outside - it appears to me that the indoor customers are highly prioritised, and the out-door folk get treated less-than. I have been noticing this practice getting worse over the years. We tried to get the attention of a waitstaff but they were just far too busy to even notice, yet they continued seating more people...only to not take their orders. Well present restaurant, unfortunately the food wasn't good enough. Owner was bit of a a***ole. We paid $198 for Mud Crab and Bug Tail. We had a fantastic dining experience! The food was exceptional, and the atmosphere was delightful. The staff were friendly and attentive.

Highly recommended for a family and friends gathering. Best of luck guys. Cheers!! Came here last minute, because I had a real hankering for some good pasta, but also wanted to see the sunset. This place was perfect. Only a tiny walk to the beach for sunset, and had huge servings of delicious pasta. The staff were friendly, and there was barely any wait time. The outdoor seating was a vibe and they were still super kid friendly. Very disappointed. Went here to support a small business with lovely people as owners. Arrived at 6pm, the time we'd booked for. Taken to our table, ordered drinks by french male host. Not long after, meal orders taken. Starter arrived not long after. Then Waited almost an hour for our main meals. The table dining behind us arrived after us, had their meals & left before we'd even got our meals. Went for a birthday meal & all I wanted to do was leave after waiting over 50 min for mains. We were told, by owner, it was busy & no phone orders taken in an hour. Only received apology from her, no offer of discount or drinks on the house. French male host could not look us in the eye after we got owner involved. Left without my child getting ice cream we'd paid for. Was so frustrating. I love supporting small business but we have no intention on going back. Atmosphere is great, but food presentation and service could improve. Pizza was average taste, but desserts are next level!!

Since being in Darwin my hubby has been trying laksa all over the city, but he says this is the best one yet- better than the ones he’s tried at the restaurants on the waterfront or anywhere else we have ventured. There is strong air conditioning in the inside, which is perfect. I ordered combination laksa,  the food was so delicious, coming with many of ingredients, fish balls chicken, worth price good value. Good location for office workers. 11 out of 10. Quick, yum friendly service. Unlike most lunch spots in the CBD the food is fresh cooked and very flavorful (not over oily food with no distinguishable taste) They should defs run in the next laska comp, would be a clear winner. Oh and very nice young family run and own business. Keep it up guys. I've ordered beef fried rice for takeaway. Because I was busy at work so not able to eat my order once I got back to work. Delicious seafood laksa, yummy beef spring roll, friendly and fast service. Dining area is inside the building (looks like a food court but has exclusive seating)",

        "Place_Reviews": "Subway Casuarina: Food is really delicious but when I order food online they always messed up with the order. This is the third time I’ve order Egg and Cheese subway and they add Bacon onto that when it clearly states egg and cheese. Staff need to be friendlier. Food hygiene is an issue. Staff need to realise that they need to change gloves when touching food. Often they restock products and then touch food without changing gloves resulting in cross contamination. Staff need training in food hygiene or need to use utensils when handling food. Following the sarcastic response from the owner I’ve amended my review to 1 star. My review was based on several visits over the past few months and not when the store was closed. No wonder this venue has a 2.5 star average rating. Only a matter of time before this venue closes. Clock’s ticking Why are you companies not offering plastic forks? The wooden ones are utterly stupid - they can barely pierce anything. It makes me not want to go to Subway for a salad. Once again, terrible customer service, not changing gloves when making a veg sandwich, giving attitude when asked to please change gloves, giving attitude when asking to please cut the sandwich in half again, well done subway casuarina for the continued bad service……….till next time I was shopping yesterday and decided to get lunch. The staff were incredibly rude laughing at customers as they ordered certain things and whispering to other staff, looking at the customers and then laughing. The food definitely wasn’t worth putting up with that that’s for sure",

Had I had a chance to wind back, I would have picked up the rib fillet or fish’n chips because I didn’t feel that I had a satisfactory filling, in fact I was hungry again after less than an hour. Great place to eat love there coffee could have a bit more variety with food that my only complaint Great spot to grab a bite to eat or a cocktail day or night. It’s at the Airport Mercure situated right above the lagoon pool surrounded by lush Tropical gardens. We ate lunch on the pool deck while we were waiting to check in. The restaurant has both in and outdoor seating and was a cool casual vibe. The meals are huge we got a couple of share plates the cob and pork belly tacos they were both tasty. Especially the pork it fell apart in your mouth very tender and was very fresh. A very relaxing afternoon will be back One pic Betty's fish and chips swimming in fat. Got a replacement and second pic the awful batter. The fish inside was nice but the garden salad 1 cherry tomato and 3 bits cucumber the rest all fricken lettuce. The saving grace of this meal was the dessert. Not a pleasant meal at all. Bartender was awesome If your staying out at the airport, this place had a great variety of meals to try. I went there  a couple of nights and tried the rino ribs and the chicken pizza, both were good. Food came quickly and there was no fuss.",

Buff is where you will meet locals, participate in great events (ukulele club meet on Tuesdays) and decent food. I ordered the prawn linguine and I wanted more (21$).

We stayed in the hotel with a group of 15. Everyone loved every meal, now that never happens!!! Fabulous Food & Service - We recently held our staff Christmas party at the D Bar & Restaurant and the consensus from our team was it was the best party we've had to date. Everything from the planning process, to the menu, venue and wait staff service was 5 star service. We were fortunate to have the venue to ourselves, and the smorgasbord buffet put on by the Chef was second to none. Everything from the fresh salads, mouth watering roast turkey,  dessert buffet and the even the espresso martinis were so delicious!

I am writing this partly in reply to the last review about dogs not being allowed. This place was a real surprise. Located at Wagait Beach, the roadside signs to the Country Club conjure pictures of a green spreading golf course, with a modern comfortable pub, with a verandah overlooking the sea. The reality is very different. The club is a humble bar in a shed with a large covered area near a mature banyan tree. The tables and chairs are very basic. Was going to go into the market looked a nice little spot, but no dogs 😕 Great place to hang out with the locals. They're extremely friendly and welcoming. Bara was delicious.",

Great feed, great service, Guinness on tap, friendly staff, what else can you ask for? This is more of a suggestion regarding breakfast, specifically about Avocado on toast. The bread used seems the one you buy in the supermarket for less than 2 dollars, a thin layer of avocado and an egg. I paid 14 dollars for something I felt I could have made without effort in my house. I think just replacing the bread for a more quality one could have done.

Even from out front it looks closed, but don’t be fooled, this larger than expected fish and chip shop is open and we were pleasantly surprised by our lunches. Although a little more expensive than we thought, both the fish and the calamari was fresh and tasty. The service was great- staff are friendly, but rushed as there were a lot of customers even though it was mid- afternoon. We would come back, the dinner box fish is large enough for 2 to share so we did that and also got a calamari box which ended up being plenty of food for the 2 of us to share. All 3 burgers were actually really nice. The price for them were good. Hamburger Lot, Salmon Burger, Barra Burger. I was annoyed when on the phone it sounded like the lady told me seafood sticks were $2 but ended up being $2.50 and the serves of chips are to laugh at, see my images of what $6 worth of chips look like. I honestly have felt ripped off. But when I opened the pack and saw that beautiful piece of snapper...awesome. The fish was fresh and was battered well, hot but still crispy. The seafood sticks were good, if only a little on the soft side but had some crispy bits. The chips were above average for fish n chip stores but the amount was a super let down. If you thought $6 of chips could feed your family you’re wrong. This review would've been a 4 or 5. The chips definitely have affected my rating. If I had only bought the fish, it would be 5 stars easy. I really love this place… Some of the best potato cakes I have ever had crispy and potato cakey. I did not get chips… Because chips are boring filler food For a quick dinner it was okay. We had 3 meals. Steak sandwich with the lot, seafood basket and grilled fish and salad. We all agreed the meals were a 7/10 each.  The chips seemed like they no even salt and just had a sprinkle when plated. The grilled fish was very over cooked. The scallop in the basket was completely tasteless. This fish and prawns in the seafood basket were awesome and very fresh. The gardens out the back were good.",

        "Place_Reviews": "SweetBrew & Co.: Absolutely love this cafe! From the moment you step in, the cozy ambiance and welcoming staff make you feel at home. The food and drinks are top-notch, with a great variety to choose from. Whether you're looking for a quick coffee or a leisurely meal, this place delivers excellence every time. Highly recommended for anyone in search of a delightful cafe experience We ordered our wedding cake from Sweetbrew and they delivered! Looked stunning & tasted even better. Highly recommend! Their bakers are incredible! This cafe has established itself as one of the most popular breakfast venues in Darwin, with its great selection for breakfast/brunch/lunch menu. In addition they bake their own delicious breads and pastries on premises, if you’re lucky you might see a stall around the local weekend markets. Large coffee shop in Stuart Pk.  Good coffee, large choice of cakes and fattening dishes.  Banana bread heated and with butter is very nice.    Service is good and the waitresses are attentive. First visit to Sweet Brew and it was great. I had the Okonominyaki (got the vegetarian option) and my partner ordered the Chili Scram. Both plates of food were delicious. The pickled ginger in the Okonominyaki balanced the whole dish and the flavours were popping. The Chili Scram had a good amount of crab and the sliced red chilis gave the dish a good hit of spice. The croissant was one of the best we have had in Darwin - buttery, flaky and melts in your mouth. Coffee was good and excellent service. First of many visits to this place!!",

        "Place_Reviews": "Cove: Yummy yummy yummy We had a family dinner here to welcome in 2020. An amazing dining experience from start to finish. Beautiful views over the lagoon pool, attentive and friendly wait staff. Steak cooked to perfection, a harmony of flavours. Highly recommend. We had an excellent dinner at Cove last night. Thomas Jang and his team put on a fantastic display of high class hospitality which included excellent meals and outstanding customer service. Staff were polite, friendly, knowledgeable and skillful. The restaurant itself is lovely with quality decor and great ambiance overlooking the lagoon. Thoroughly enjoyable night. A perfect place for an elegant dinner. Perfect food and service and a great French-speaking manager. I return there every time I have the opportunity and bring my family with me. Thank you Cove and Mindil Beach Casino Resort.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Dragon Court: My friend and I had a fantastic meal at Dragon Court. The food was delicious, and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Definitely recommend it for a great dining experience! Great service awesome food, good atmosphere. Dragon Court is a must for yummy Chinese food. We had prawn dumplings, crispy wonton for entree, garlic prawns, beautiful for main and crispy beef in plum sauce, with mixed vegetables and prawn fried rice, absolutely delicious. Couple of beers and for 2 well worth the $180 food was soooo good! haven’t eaten that much in so long 🤣 There was a better selection of cocktails in the restaurant than the vue bar and I would highly recommend the double happiness. Sizzling lamb and the pork belly and mushroom were devine and the meat melted on the tongue. Lovely meal, expensive, but worth it. Great food, but small portions. Good atmosphere but only a small place so a bit noisy.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Green Chillies Darwin: I was disappointed. In the butter chicken were few pieces of chicken in a bowl of thick soup. In the lamb dish, also the meat was hard to find. Not bad for flavours and taste but $20 for a bowl if soupy butter chicken it is a bit pricey. The bread was soaked in oil. I don't feel I can recommend this place as personally I won't go there again. Absolutely shocking I ordered the Thai green curry with rice and roti, the rice and roti were decent quality but the curry was essentially an oil soup. It wasn't curry, I couldn't scoop anything with the roti as it was literally a soup. I tasted it and it was incredibly spicy for what's supposed to be a mild, coconut based curry so I decided against eating it at all as it wasn't what I ordered, and for $46 total it was a massive disappointment. Wouldn't recommend this place and I definitely won't be ordering from here again. Had a meal in the Restaurant on December 30th, as we were staying at the Argus. Food was amazing. Butter Chicken, Special Fried Rice combination, and Mongolian Beef... we could have eaten here every night... and the staff were wonderful!!! Stayed in the Hotel and had dinner here last night. Ordered the pad see yew and beef massaman with Garlic naan. The naan was really very good and the Pad See Yew was good. Massaman was also very good. I would recommend (for eat in).",

        "Place_Reviews": "Laneway Coffee, Darwin: Laneway Coffee is just the best in Darwin. We had a wonderful breakfast. The atmosphere was great and the service amazing. Definitely going back there. Thank you Laneway Coffee 🙏👏👍🍀 Best breakky ever!! And service is great too! Would love to have this place in my city, but nice excuse to come to Darwin again! Thank you :) Love this place. I have worked next door for 4 years and this was my escape place. Super service from all past and present workers, too many to single out and mention. My only compliant is seeing a handful of customers can treat the lovely staff whom are always smiling and cheerful despite the busyness! Like my coffee today, I am sad to no long be “a regular”. Coffee 10/10 Coffee here is great. I have tried it twice and will come back again. Haven't had a chance to try the foods, but definitely order some next time. Service is excellent, very friendly staffs. Location is at the corner, so very easy to recognize the shop.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Crust Pizza Parap: I have enough of burned pizza made in a rush and at the third bad pizza I decided to post a review. I used to think Crust made an awesome pizza, their standards have gone down big time. Got delivered and it was warm, not really hot, presentation of the pizza itself,  looked like it had been thrown together,  won't be wasting my money getting crust pizza anymore,  I'm done! Ordered an extra large and it was maybe a medium at best. Most places a extra large is 16”-18”. It was like 7”-9” at best. \"Terrible service! The staff was rude and inattentive. I have to wait for ages to get my food, and when it finally arrived, it had a hair in pizza and poorly cooked. Not worth the price.\" The pizzas were dry and bland . I asked for extra chilli and for a hot pizza and was told “ we can’t do it “ feel let down completely with not only the serving but the three pizzas and side . All below average. Couldn’t recommend",

        "Place_Reviews": "Darwin Trailer Boat Club: The best place to have a buffet breakfast event. It's better than hotel breakfast. The mushroom is so juicy, the toast is thick and moist. Reasonable price. Great location for a sea view dining. Lunchtime gets the nice breezes with the front view of the beautiful turquoise sea colour. The evening holds the spectacular sunset views and evening stars that cross the harbour during dinner. The food is good quality pub food though can be pricey but overall good. What a lovely venue to watch the sunset. A must-see for tourists. Very reasonable prices and a good menu which caters well to gluten and dairy free food intolerances. Large servings and good value for money.  Yummy salad bar. Would have preferred the barramundi without the red curry sauce, as it was quite hot & meant I couldn't really enjoy the flavour of the fish. Lovely though, good fresh, seafood options. The menu may be small, but the Chicken Laksa was delightful and full of flavor. While the steak was just average, the entrées truly stood out as delicious. Given how busy it gets, I highly recommend making a reservation. One downside is that the noise level can be quite high, making conversation a bit challenging. On the plus side, the restaurant is very kid-friendly and conveniently offers access to the beach. The most gorgeous sunsets can be enjoyed from there. A great place to catch a meal, share a drink and relax. Sunsets are beautiful here. Kids loved it as it has a playground, a pool and is on the beach.",

        "Place_Reviews": "The Trader Winnellie Road: Love this place, it has to be one of the best I have seen in Darwin. The food is great. Take a look at the Facebook page to see pictures that show the quality of the food and the presentation. The woman that runs the place seems to be an excellent pastry chef and has an inherent creative streak and understanding of food. This also extends to her comments and descriptions on the Facebook page as well. One of the things I did notice was what seemed to be real avocado on toast and not the ubiquitous \"smashed\" nonsense that the millennials seem to inhale in Adelaide. This cafe is warmly lit in a cool industrial interior, with a mix of private and group seating. The staff were outstandingly friendly and kind even when it was busy. Coffee and breakfast were well made and I’m excited to go back to try the baked goods! There's nothing more Italian than simple done well. You know the bread game is strong when their schiacciata can hold all that roasted free range chicken and homemade aioli. Ingredients are super fresh and atmosphere is very chilled. Exceptional everything, especially the beautiful folks who make the magic happen. Fast, friendly, fresh with talented baristas. Ten out of ten for the range of food and all the house made goodies. I have made this a regular spot while I am in Darwin Transportation need to get to this trendy industrial-styled coffee shop. Friendly staff, slightly bitter taste  #coffee (yum), food is well presented and filling. Busy industrial area so far park may be a challenge. Good for date, business chats or plain relaxing.",

        "Place_Reviews": "One Mile Brewery (NT): My go to place for any of my visitors here in Darwin. I love the fresh beers that are priced fairly. Stu and his crew are the best and friendliest. If you guys ever travel to Darwin, please dont miss out on this wonderful nook! This place is the true blue Territorean vibes.💜💜💜 Stu and Bardy are the best! Unique venue and amazing products. Crazy biking community and outstanding service. Such a great lol bar. So many locally brewed options, a great snack choice (traditional pug grub like pizza, loaded fries with a few extras like Mongolian beef spring rolls). My fave beer is the RDO but they are all great. Heard good things so popped in to check it out. The place is awesome! Had 2 good beers there and saw locals buying takeaways.",
