        "Place_Reviews": "Hotel Grand Chancellor Hobart: The Grand Chancellor is a delightful hotel that made our stay in Hobart truly enjoyable. The rooms are modern and comfortable, with a great selection of pillows to ensure a good night's sleep. Staff here are very friendly and always happy to help. Hotel is in a prime location in Hobart. The hotel itself has a well designed interior throughout. Gym and pool are decent. I would highly recommend getting breakfast included as there is a relatively vast range of breakfast options. Rooms were spacious and clean, and the bathrooms were relatively modern. Lovely hotel in an ideal location on the Hobart waterfront. Rooms are nice, would suggest selecting and paying more for a room that has a view of the harbour (for obvious reasons). It‚Äôs obviously not a cheap hotel however the hotel doesn‚Äôt try and hide that it‚Äôs a high end place to stay. Carpark underneath with plenty of places, nice pool and GREAT gym for a hotel. The sauna is actually a bit hidden as it‚Äôs  inside the bathrooms in the gym and not the swimming pool area‚Ä¶so when you head down there‚Äôs no signage to tell you this point unless you physically go into the gym area and into the bathroom where there‚Äôs a door in each gender toilet to get into the shared sauna Rooms are clean and functional.  The bathroom could be bigger! They charge for bottles of water in the room, which usually is free in other hotels. It should be complimentary. What a great hotel. Right across the water! Loved the little touches of Lindt on the bed ü•∞ huge room, great for working. Loved the space in the bathroom and my shower was spotless. Our only issue was no elevator from the lower car park, not inclusive üëéüèª.",

        "Place_Reviews": "The Henry Jones Art Hotel: The Henry Jones is in the perfect location for a weekend in Hobart, with easy access to the wharf, the ferry to MONA & lots of restaurants. My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in one of the original rooms. The room was spacious and comfortable. Most importantly considering the weather it was warm. We had a view out to the docks and could see boats come in. If you do stay we recommend the free art tour which was interesting both for the art and the historical facts about the IXL jam factory. Again and again, I return to Henry Jones because simply it is incomparable to any other place I‚Äôve stayed across the world. The warmth of the staff is symbiotic with the hotel ambience. In a word, it is enchanting. From the moment you walk through the doors you are captivated. Each room is exquisite and unique, stone walls and long timbers framing the art laden walls. With windows which peer out on the quiet ambiance of Hobart docklands and views reaching the mountains which hold the timelessness of this city. .The presentation is  perfection. Looking forward to visiting yet again for another memorable experience. Thank you to the staff who continue to provide exceptional hospitality. We had a lovely stay at the Henry Jones Art Hotel in Hobart. The location is on the waterfront, in a historic building and a lovely walk to the high street, Salamanca Market and the MONA ferry. Room was very large and charming, including a large bathtub with jacuzzi feature. Gina at the front of house was a stand out - she was always bubbly and so helpful, providing excellent recommendations for food and parking. We stayed at the hotel for a night, left for a few days to visit Cradle Mountain and returned for the rest of our stay in Hobart. On our return, we were pleasantly surprised by a personal card and locally produced chocolates in our room. On our last day, Gina came through yet again with another card and chocolates for each person in our party. Thank you to all and especially Gina at the Henry Jones Art Hotel for making us feel so welcome! Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone visiting Hobart. I couldn't fault this establishment. It was the perfect way to \"spoil\" ourselves for the last days of our Tassie trip. The stay at the hotel was an experience in itself, just taking time to wander the halls and take in the beautiful artworks. Truly a memorable anniversary experience in an amazingly culturally rich environment.",

They went above and beyond to make our stay a great one. We slept comfortably in the warm beds with electric blankets and went to the restaurant for a delicious breakfast. If we are ever in the area again we will be staying here. Price was more than generous. Fantastic location,  pretty much central to everything.  Room service was great and the big breakfast we ordered was very yummy.  It was featured to wake up to a waterfront view. The ducks that came to visit were very cute and there is a lovely walk with a playground for the kids and a half tennis court. we will be back again.  Was very peaceful  and prices were very reasonable. Love it!! very clean neat and cosy . Went here for dinner and was pleasantly surprised! The portions were massive and you don't need much more than the 2 sides that come with the main meals. Vegetarian and vegan options are available, just ask. Pretty well stocked bar and friendly staff. Kids menu and high chairs are available. Great retro stay with excellent service and reliable food.",

It was very pleasant without the crowd except over the weekend with the young casino gamers. Terrific place to stay This is my first stay here. The only issues I have are with the room itself, which was lovely, except I'd expect a little better from wrest point  the walls were thick with dust and the loo  was very badly stained, which is not acceptable. The door to the bathroom had fake tan finger marks on it. Everything else was great. The casino staff and rooms are really just wonderful! And what a view!!!!! Beautiful hotel with lovely rooms.

The selection of teas was impressive, and the staff was knowledgeable and attentive, helping us choose the perfect blends to complement our food. We just experienced a beautiful family lunch for 15 people.  The service was fantastic and the food sensational. The wine was delicious and well worth a second bottle. The locations and view across the river don‚Äôt get any better.  Thank you  for making our special day as a family even better. Very special memories. Beautiful venue with equally appealing food that tastes just as good as it looks. The Earl Grey Supreme tea is delicious and pairs beautifully with the high tea. Service was amazing. One a side note to follow google maps follow the signage and trust your gut. A lovely estate with a great selection of wines. A fantastic demonstration of typical Tassie cold climate wines done exceptionally well with a few surprises for the palette. Drew is a friendly and knowledgeable host if you‚Äôre after a tasting. We came to the Alice in wonderland high tea as a group of girls to catch up. Had an amazing time, great food, great service.

I stayed in two rooms, the main hotel is immaculately furnished and second place across the road rooms are even more spacious and in our family room we have a great kitchen and a sunny balcony. Beds are super comfy in both. Only issue was air con was broken in main hotel but didn‚Äôt feel cold as was provided with heater. Ask for a bathtub before booking. Love the heated floor in bathrooms. And quiet too! I‚Äôll be back for sure. üíõ Turned up to my prepaid booking through thier site and the air conditioning was broken in my room. They couldn‚Äôt give me one of the rooms where the air conditioning was working so without any assistance from them had to find another hotel. The receptionist was incredibly rude - she knew I was ill and needed air con and did absolutely zero to sort out a solution, or to treat me with respect. Note the listed ‚Äúwindows that open‚Äù only open a crack. Avoid booking here - you could end up needing to scrounge for another hotel room yourself because of repair issues - with no assistance and not even a printed refund reciept. Went somewhere a bit further from the market location - a whole different experience - polite, kind and helpful and suite much better ‚Ä¶ sometimes location isn‚Äôt everything! Wow the rooms have been spruced up and are lovely. But the lift OMG that thing has been cranky for the last 20 years, still it makes the trip exciting. We were so glad we booked this place for our trip to Hobart. Location is the best as you walk out and you are in the best part of Hobart. We stayed here especially for the Saturday markets as its right next to it. However it is about 10-15 minutes walk into the CBD area where most retail stores are. We loved exploring Battery point and Salamanca. There is also the Salamanca fresh supermarket nearby for groceries. We had the 1 bedroom studio with kitchen and it was very comfortable. Free laundry was also handy. They also have onsite parking which i believe is free if you book direct and if not there is a fee to park. Staff were very helpful. We would recommend this hotel. Exceeding philosophy statement, Home away from home experience. we were warmly welcomed by the lady at the front desk had a warm and friendly smile. We  enjoyed hospitality and comforts that I normally don't anticipate. Salamanca itself has a buzzing vibe most of the time and we felt part of that vibe well into the night. I would recommend to bring ear plugs if you need perfect quiet to sleep.Thank you for a memorable stop over. I will definitely be back next time I come home.",

Lamb chops nice and juicy. My fingers were so red from the lamb chop seasoning though. Is that normal? Dined in and enjoyed the food with friends. Food came out quickly. Loved the Mango Chicken with Cheese Garlic Naan. The Store's timing on Google is wrong, and the taste of every dish is disappointing. The food is cold, and there is a lingering smell of old oil in the dishes. Some dishes are overly salty, while others lack salt. Additionally, the tandoori chicken has an excessive amount of artificial color. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Veg pulao was the worst, 60-70% of the box was filled with half cooked unsalted cauliflower & the rice was dipped in oil Pulao completely bland. Such a waste of time & money.

        "Place_Reviews": "Hadley's Orient Hotel: I absolutely loved staying at Hadley‚Äôs on my first visit to Hobart - it won‚Äôt be my last. It‚Äôs perfectly located, within walking distance of just about everything, and very close to two Skybus stops in the city. Lots of excellent eating options within spitting distance, and the perfect base for exploring this unique destination. This historic hotel was a great choice for us. We went back-and-forth on different hotels, and we made the right choice.  Yes, the rooms are a bit small, but it ticked a lot of boxes for us. Very clean and comfortable, Great bathroom, really nice storage area for your luggage and clothes, beautiful quality, toiletries, Great location to walk to the seafront. Nice happy hour in the bar. And great friendly, helpful staff. The hotel itself is rich in history and the decor is what you would expect. The rooms were kept very tidy and clean, as was all areas of the hotel. My only gripe is the parking and the access to it. By the way, if you ask me (a customer) how was my stay and I give you feedback on the parking, I don't expect a lecture on how lucky I am to get parking for $5 a day. Let me be very clear here, the parking location is terrible. You have to walk down the street and around the corner of another street to find the entrance. There are 8 levels (including 4a, 5a, 6a, etc) to circumnavigate each time you enter or leave the building. It feels like a trek in it's own right and to be honest, put us off even wanting to use the car. Yes, it's $5 a day, however most, if not all hotels have their own carparks. I actually would've been happier to pay $20 a day for parking if it was more accessible. It should be more clear on your website on the parking situation. This would at least give people a choice on whether to rent a car or not. Otherwise, thank you for a lovely stay in the hotel. Cozy vintage Hotel, picturesque frames at its lounge telling its story and their guests, old style  furniture, the lounge and bar with the music of the period among with pieces from the hotel old times.  Great staff, gentle and friendly. 24 hour front desk reception. Variety of options for breakfast. Very clean and cozy room. My friend and I had a most wonderful experience at Hadley‚Äôs high tea this afternoon, made all the more special by the outstanding service provided by our most charming hostess, Chelsea. She was just so lovely and attentive. This one‚Äôs a keeper  - manager hold on to her!  Everything was delectable and delicious and I would highly recommend Hadley‚Äôs high tea for its elegant ambience and old world charm. Again, a special shout out to the lovely Chelsea who made us feel extra special. 10 out of 10!!!",

Her ability to connect with our Autistic son was second to none Great location for airport, good room size, comfortable bed. The major problem was the design of the shower. In this new modern age of no shower doors or screens, the slope of the floor to the drain is vitally important.

This is by far the best accommodation in Hobart, Tasmania. A traditional old-fashioned B&B with plenty of beds in each family room (we were a group of 7 friends). Our host John was great to chat to and very attentive at breakfast. The location is central and perfect. Highly recommend. It's my go to place whenever we are in hobart. Perfect welcome for our first trip to Tasmania. John made sure we were well-accommodated, gave us clear directions to where we wanted to go, and made a few suggestions that made our trip more enjoyable.

Well I'm lost for words. I've never known what \"BP\" stands for, but i guess it stands for \"Brilliant Petrol\". I put some Unleaded 91 in my car and it was honestly faultless. My car moved forwards and backward with 0 issues after refuelling from BP Margate. Very nice staff always attend with smile and yummy coffee served by Amarjot",

Came in the morning and it‚Äôs pretty quiet, very glad to see the staff cleaning up the place. (Lots and lots of cleaning!) very impressed After ordering online to save time I had to wait at the counter for 30 minutes before getting served to only get my order printed and had to wait for it to be made. And then managed to get the order all wrong when getting home. Very poor service, the owners and staff need some serious training. I'm not sure if it's common practice or not but was in there on 2nd Feb late afternoon & a young boy walked through the front entrance with a wheelie bin to the back of the store, then a few minutes later walked back through the store with it. I just didn't think that was very professional or sanitary. Also took a little bit to be served with only a couple in front of me, but the two girls serving were very polite. I think this is the best subway in Hobart. The lettuce is always fresh and they aren‚Äôt stingy with the ingredients. Also the renovations here look great! Lovely spot! Served by Patrick who was polite, efficient and 100% on top of his game.",

I came in today to grab some lunch and the girl (Tash) who served me was awful. She was extremely rude. The manager witnessed this and cringed but didn't appear to have said anything to her. Such a shame, the rest of the team that work here are really nice but i won't be back if she's working. Its been long since I had a cheesy garlic toastie from subway that wasn't burnt and bread wasn‚Äôt stale. Loved the cheesy garlic toastie made by the lovely girl! Place stands open until 10 pm and is easy for those are traveling around late night and decide to eat something. It was providential having it around. Luck us! I like the salads here.

I have always asked for 2 different cheese everywhere else when I get foot long sub but has never been charged extra but she was very rude so I just paid and walked away.

Did have a footlong of malted rye. Bread was stale and at one side hard. It appeared to me that it was bread from the day before. I won't blame the girls, they are probably just working under instructions from their manager/boss. However in a business like this there is always waste. If the manager wants to reduce waste I suggest he/she eats the old stuff self.

We equally enchanted by the 3 course √† la carte lunch that we enjoyed, complete with excellent entertainment at the Faro restaurant. We caught the Mona Roma to and from Mona, which was relaxing. Highly recommend! I. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE MONA. I feel like my visit there was not as long as I would have liked, as I was travelling with others. If you‚Äôre a fan of dark, depressive, vulgar and all things genitals art you‚Äôll like it. I wish I could only get the ferry ride as the boat is nice and there are dolphins and seals all around. 25 minutes were more than enough to see the gallery. A portion of the art was enjoyable to me, and honestly that‚Äôs all you really need. Their app allows the people to leave their milquetoast opinions, which are remarkably similar to the low reviews here. Those who take issue with the alleged ‚Äúdownfall‚Äù of contemporary art should stay clear of the museum and revise their reactionary talking points. If you are such a prude maybe stay in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (which is great, no shame there). My only real issue is that it is incredibly expensive to get there, $60 for the ferry and admission is bonkers. Mona mucked us around a bit with our lunch reservation at faro, however the art is obviously amazing. It‚Äôs like questicon for adults. Shout out to BRETT who was working at the confession exhibition, he was lovely and hilarious. Museum goers and workers can come off as dry a lot of the time (I am definitely guilty of it).

Despite a minor mishap where my mom accidentally spilled her cup of coffee, Immediately upon the spill, the staff swiftly began preparing a fresh cup of coffee for my mom.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Subway: Went in yesterday with my younger sister who was in school uniform to meet my older brother who was ordering and my sister and i needed to use the toilet and as i go to walk in with her the girl working at the time yells out in the rudest tone ‚ÄúNO SMOKING, ILL BE CHECKING‚Äù with authority and as i was in there my brother told her we don‚Äôt smoke and that we are his sisters, and she apologised to him and said it was because i was in full black and wearing a duffle bag which is used to carry my school books and i was in full black because i was keeping warm. She had brown hair and was short and looked between 18-21ish. There was an incident with girls wearing full black and duffels smoking in there, I just needed to use the toilet and she was yelling at me as i‚Äôm minding my own business. Not an apology nothing, so unprofessional never going here again!!! How can someone go so wrong at a Subway Franchise. Utter disappointment at its best. Really bad service at Glenorchy Subway I am really disappointed. It‚Äôs just a wastage of money. Who‚Äôs gona come next time to saw the service like this. I ordered two foot longers online and it was clearly mentioned in my receipt that need to bes tosted but no one bothered. I mentioned that no tomatoes but they just filled it up with tomatoes. It was way to cold like I took something out from the fridge and straight away eaten it. Three staff were working, none seemed to know how to do their jobs. Seemed to be incapable of managing orders even when it was not busy.  Couldn‚Äôt redeem a simple offer for a free cookie and drink I had on my app. Straight up told me ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt use this code‚Äù when we clearly could. Very worst customer service, doesn‚Äôt understand order and racist.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Domino's Pizza Rosny: Pizza delivered hot and fresh, with absolute STAR customer service from the driver. After ringing the store to pass on my feedback, I can now publicly say, Billy, your service was 10/10 and we hope to see you again mate! üëçüèª Went in today and was greeted by a friendly worker at the counter, when I received my food everything was perfect, I asked for extra pepperoni and it was spot on üëå best pizza in a while, thanks to the kitchen staff Ordered spicy peppy paneer,  but they delivered  the pizza with chicken in it. And they just sprinkled the paneer on top of it, putting my gealth at risk as I am a pure vegetarian person. Pathetic service. Order was messed up and we were told we could get them replaced but then the manager repeatedly hung up the phone saying they‚Äôre not giving any free food away. Overall this place makes great pizza as I am ordering it for past 6 weeks and only once I felt they let me down but overall,  they make the beat pizza with consistency and on time. May be I should say they are not stingy and make it with love as it should be. Nowadays, people are cutting corners with the toppings but at least these people are giving what the standard is and with love. Overall great staff and good quality pizza ! Keep the good work going guys",

Matthew was fantastic! Super helpful and friendly and did everything he could to assist us through the night window with some forgotten essentials (tooth brush etc). He also heated up a pie for my partner with no complaint at all. He did this all with a super friendly demeanour and smile. Really appreciate your service tonight/this morning mate. Not bad. Went for manual car wash. $2 for 2 mins We left our fuel cap there 5 days ago, finally realised, and they had kept it for us, too easy. Just so appreciated, and we always get excellent service from them. Cheers again guys :)",

        "Place_Reviews": "Subway Kingston: Usually don‚Äôt have an issue here but the last few times I‚Äôve been (twice in a week) it‚Äôs been busy and understaffed. Tonight there was one worker on his own getting absolutely slammed as person after person and multiple groups came in, one lady (possibly Uber) was standing at the counter in the way holding her phone up as the staff member was trying to check out customers, one customer complaining loudly about the wait time. Felt really bad for the staff member trying his best to keep up! Maybe roster more staff on for peak times as it‚Äôs not pleasant for the staff or customers. Very polite service staff. Sandwich we had was fresh and filled. They even cut the footlong in half and seperatly wrapped both pieces as we were sharing the meal. Quite busy at lunch time however the queue moved freely. So consistent I love it, always have a good experience here. Staff are lovely and efficient and the food always delicious. Have been to Hobart subway a few times and am always disappointed, never at Kingston though, bloody love their work The Staff are too young to handle a busy shop. Please hire some mature people so that the kids don't panic and customers have a pleasant experience Went in today for a quick bite. Was greeted by a friendly young worker. Staff was happy and talkative, and the best part is the fact that she made a delicious sandwich! I've been to Subway a few times now, but today was the best sub I've ever had.",

        "Place_Reviews": "bp: Obnoxious and unpleasant service from the blonde cashier mid afternoon 25/3. Asked politely if she could break a $50 for me and received no verbal response and she just huffed to the till. Slammed it close and abruptly says something like 'aint got it' - no explanation as to no small bills, maybe would you like to buy a drink, or anything like that. I was shocked and as I stood there she aggressively follows up with 'not happening pal' and basically stared me down. Completely unreasonable customer service. I was asked if I wanted two free chocolates with my fuel purchase. I declined so the cashier scanned two twix bars and replied ‚Äú I‚Äôll have them then‚Äù‚Ä¶ acceptable ??? I wouldn‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶ Recently visted Bp Brighton to buy Connoisseur ice cream tub peanut butter crunchy 1 Ltr found that the staff was charging me $15 instead of $14.50. There was a ticket of the peanut butter crunchy but wrong filling line of products on the shelf. Informed the staff about the price he refused to give me for $14.50. Didn't expect such type of customer service and getting over charged. Helpful staff, fast service, Krispy Kreme doughnuts n cheap cigs... fabulous! I recently visited here and had the pleasure of meeting Simran. She provided me with exceptional customer service and made sure that my experience at the store was a great one. I had an issue with my card payment, but Simran handled it with professionalism and efficiency. She truly went above and beyond to look after her customers. The coffee was great as well! I highly recommend this place, and I hope that Simran's excellent work is recognized and rewarded by the management team. Thank you, Simran, for making my visit such a memorable one!\"",

He didnot tell me anything about the door when I made my payment and when I pressed the button to open the door he got angry and was straight up rude. He doesn't know the basic etiquette of customer service. The way he was speaking, this was the worst person to ever serve me. That store clerk was super rude! They wouldn't let me in and even made inappropriate gestures because of where I parked. He followed up by refusing to let other patrons in the store because how I moved my car whilst looking online for the most appropriate way to complain Great modern station with friendly staff, premises is kept very clean and tidy . Trying to get served .... one staff trying to serve people on  her own while the others pretend they are doing work The lady that served us was one of the friendliest service station employees I‚Äôve ever come across",

Nice and close to airport and airport accommodation. Also a subway on site for a quick bite. At the time I was in Tas had very competitive prices and this is good when refilling your hire car. And easy to get to. Good station right before the airport. Not an abundance of pumps so may have to wait if it is busy. Lots of parking outside store, easy entry and exit. Well stocked store inside! Wow what a amazing place very friendly staff . Decorated in pink for McGrath day. Well done BP Hobart airport",

Chips had 0 salt when we asked for extra and while we were collecting the food they asked again and they said if chicken salts fine and I said yes but still 0 salt took 20 minutes to get 3 three price meal and we got them all upgraded but 1 was a medium but we were charged for a large and don't get me started on the drink when I first grabbed it out their hand it felt like it was about to explode and the second I drove away from the drive through it popped and is all over my seat and me. Cheers KFC üëç Disgraceful store with staff who do not care at all about customers.  Manager is just a disgrace as has no idea what he is doing.  A male dark staff member, forever wiping his nose wit the back of his hand.   11am, and still making people wait for food,as too lazy to cook on time.   These people,don't have a clue about customer relations or serivice. My partner and myself ordered a zinger box  and an original box for myself.... the Buns on both of ours were hard as a rock....chicken was not much better.....dry and not fresh at all.....we should have chosen better as this experience has been had before, buti never complained",

Wish I can do 0 ‚ú®The worst Chinese food I‚Äôve ever had in here! over price n slow service , only because I order some ‚Äú complicated ‚Äú dish which have to wait until cheif make easy dished for other table( after me ) first‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. We went here  late night, everywhere was closed and also here was closed but the owner welcome us to seat and ordered. Very kind of him. The food's great and the staff are really nice. Only thing is, it gets pretty crowded, so you might want to book a table ahead of time. Arguably the best Chinese I've eaten in years, pork belly in chilli was amazing, there was also a duck in vermicelli that was so tender and flavourful, and the dumplings were clearly made in house. Service was a little less attentive than I'd expect, and the atmosphere was a little flat but that may well have been just because we were likely the first customers for the evening, but without question I will be back I came here quiet late at night. They where doing take away only. I ordered wonton and satay chicken spicy, and rice.",

Wow the most horrifying experience, the service was atrocious had to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and the chicken ended up being god damn raw in the centre.if i had of thought before i left i should have taken a bite out of each piece to see how well it was cooked or not, personally i think they should put kfc,hungry jacks,McDonald's all in the same boat cause its all mcshit,you probably better off running your finger around the rim of Northgates toilets you probably get less sickness from them. Nailed the sliders - very enjoyable. Ordered with them through Uber. Took almost an hour for our order to be ready and the chicken was so burnt that it had obviously been cooking the entire time. Will never order from them again, it was disgustingü§Æ Uber eats half the order missing, can‚Äôt reach the store as they say they are closed, but we know they are open, very disappointing NEVER AGAIN and I‚Äôll spread the word",

        "Place_Reviews": "Machine Laundry Cafe: This is a really eclectic place that is actually attached to a working laundromat. There is seating inside and out, and for those cooler days they even have blankets tou can use to keep warm. I enjoyed the hotcakes which can with a great berry sauce. My partner enjoyed the porridge which tasted sublime. The only criticism of the porridge was the size of the serving which was simply enormous. I guess that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called 3 bears porridge because you could feed that many. Service was okay. Coffee was great. What can I say!  I had no idea of this place until my friend decided to take me for lunch.  I'm so glad he did. We have eaten here before and always look forward to coming back. Excellent menu, we had the 'Fat Boy's roti that had grilled chicken and vegetables with peanut sauce. Their coffee is always amazing and it's in a great area at Salamanca. If you are in town eat here...oh and you can do your washing here. Really. Raspberry Chocolate muffin was on offer the day I went in - what a treat! The texture was just perfect, crunchy top and perfectly moist throughout with tons of chocolate and raspberries! It came warm with a serve of fresh butter which was lovely. Best granola! Great food, fresh, healthy and big serves.",
