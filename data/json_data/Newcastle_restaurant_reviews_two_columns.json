        "Place_Reviews": "NOAH'S on the beach: Super stay. Great location next to the beach and near to a convenience store, cafes and good restaurants. Friendly staff. Car park a big bonus. Rooms clean and comfortable. Parking free under the building (small tight spots), friendly reception staff. We stayed on the 4th floor, bathroom seemed to have been recently refurbished and nice. Bed wasn‚Äôt the best, and furniture in the room a bit dated. Mini bar reasonably priced, tea/coffee/biscuits in the room, TV & foxtel. Views - spectacular! Bring binoculars - we saw several whales breech far out in the ocean which was exciting. Buffet breakfast was varied and tasty, again, amazing views! Walked to the end of the street for dinner at Sticky Rice Thai (yum!) and other restaurants close by. Would definitely stay at Noah‚Äôs again, we have a great time! We had a beautiful Mother's day lunch. The view is amazing from all tables. The food was delicious which came with a complimentary drink. The service was fantastic. We won the lucky door prize of a hamper of wines and chocolates which was a lovely surprise. As my wife & I were attending an event in Newcastle on the Saturday, we decided to stay overnight & booked in to Noah's on the beach. Although it was only one night, I would have no hesitation in staying there again & recommending Noah's to anyone looking for accommodation in the heart of Newcastle. The friendly staff @ reception made it easy to check in & the upgrade to an ocean view room was much appreciated after a long day to just relax & watch the waves roll in. We stayed at Noah's over the weekend. It was $500 for the 2 night for a room with a queen and a single  on the harbour side not the beach side. If you are on a high enough level (we were on 5) The harbour side is more interesting to look at at night, lots of city lights and big ships coming in to the port. The beach side would have nice views during the day but be pretty dark at night. There are slightly cheaper rooms but you are lower down and look at the parking lot. Really good location to walk around that end of Hunter St. We enjoyed our stay, would have been nice to have a microwave. Oh and they have actual cable, all the good channels which was fantastic!",

My partner and I have been to a couple of the beer events that the Burwood has hosted. The events were fantastic. The pub itself is incredibly beautiful and sophisticated whilst also encapsulating a very cozy and relaxing vibe. Tony and Sandra are extremely friendly and inviting. I recommend the Burwood Inn very highly to all! We came in for a quick lunch Good Friday. Service and food top notch. Scotch fillet with mushroom gravy excellent. The gravy didn't at all taste like the usual packet mix. Wife loved the barramundi special. Can't wait to come back, worth the drive from Sydney. Such a beautiful venue! We had my daughters christening lunch here- a group of around 20 people. They kindly allocated us the beautiful courtyard all to our selves. Everyone commented on how nice the courtyard was and also how delicious the food and drinks were.  The service was great also! So glad we chose to have our event here :) This place seriously has the best steaks I have ever eaten. I had a rib eye and my partner had eye fillet. The best steaks are here. I have eaten steaks at some of the finest steakhouses in Canberra and other parts of Australia but the steak here wins hands down there is no comparison. If you are in the area and want a good steak this is the only place to go.",

There is no food anywhere close by after 8pm, will have to go for a 10 walk a few streets away but it's July so it's freezing in Newcastle. Hotel rooms are decent for the price. Taking in a show at the Theatre and need somewhere to stay? - you've found it here. Great vibe, big room, clean, cheery and convenient. We will be back, again and again. We came for dinner before a show at the Civic Theatre. Can I just say your staff are lovely. Had a phonecall through the day indicating how busy it was and suggesting we could come earlier if able. We arrived just after 5.00pm and the staff were so welcoming, helped us quickly place our order and food was brought out in a flash. Bar staff also friendly and were on for a chat about the wine my parents purchased. Huge thanks from us, it made our night how lovely everyone was! Perfect location for Civic theatre. Great and friendly bar, hotel and restaurant. Parking not on site but east enough walk from plenty of other parking areas. Music on a Sunday afternoon but not too loud, and hotel does specify they do have music over the weekend. Thank you again for a great weekend. A great location and meeting point to meet friends prior to a mid-week music gig next door at Civic. Tasty food options & massive on tap range of beverages! Great service too.",

Lunchtime and saw this was only 7 minutes away. Had luggage walked in. Staff friendly. Ordered from the days blackboard special. I chose chicken snitty. I elected mash veggies and gravy instead of fries. Had a lemon lime and bitters.  The snitty came quickly. It was like having a good home cooked meal. The LLB was the best I've had in years. It was actually tasty. They didn't try to rush me and I enjoyed a leisurely meal and rested in the warmth before going for my bus. Sunday so began to fill up with the Sunday sports bar watchers. Recommend for a good pub meal. Thanks I'll be back when returning from my next o/s trip and on my way home. The best pizza in Newcastle.  Double duck hasn't changed a thing. Fantastic food. Great kitchen staff. The room smelt like wet socks, the bed was on a lean so you rolled to one side.

The owners also have a music taste that is very suiting of the setting In which they offer as an experience that remains memorable for my fam. Great range of mouth watering pizza choices with a broad variety of veggie options aswell!! We are two 21-year-old girls who stayed at this hotel for one night. The bar and pizza place downstairs were great and the room and bathrooms were reasonable for the price we payed (although the showers had a habit of going from boiling to freezing to boiling again‚Ä¶.). The main downside to our stay was how unsafe we felt. The other guests were loud and left their doors open all day and night, playing music and making loud comments when we would walk past (which we had to do get to the stairs and bathrooms). They even came to our door and pretended to be room service. We felt that the staff should have better monitored their guests and at the very least ask them to keep their doors shut and the noise levels down. We understand that the hotel cannot control how guests act but we felt that no steps were taken to ensure the space was welcoming and safe for everyone. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying here for more than one night, especially as a young woman. Rooms are very fare for the price and always been clean every time I've stayed and the staff are very accommodating and friendly. Easy parking. No complaints here. Highly recommended for cheap night or weekend away Came in tonight and was served by a gorgeous gentleman of the name Felix! He warmed my heart with his gentle smile and soft humour! Big cheers for Felix!!! Known as the Ori to locals, this pup is a cracker. The pizza is very good, and the pavement seating is a delight.

Meanwhile two other employees wandererd around in the background, doing very little.  One girl had a broom and was pretending to be sweeping.....

The past few times I‚Äôve ordered pizza wrap with gf wraps the quality of wrap I have received is truly on par with the work of a 3 year old child. In each case the wrap was not wrapped in the white baking paper, was cold & the wrap was cracked and falling apart. If the ladies are serving, DON‚ÄôT buy. Yesterday a sub with NO salad! Beyond scabby, all the reviews appear to say the same, I don‚Äôt know why and how they still have a business. Worst atmosphere I‚Äôve ever been in. Skimpy on the the topping even after I asked for more. Like the previous reviews it did seem like I inconvenienced them with my order. It seems as though they‚Äôve lost their love for being a sandwich artist; perhaps a career change will bring joy back into their lives. Stay away from this Subway! Whenever I go I feel like I'm inconveniencing them. On my latest trip I arrived just after 8 (when they open) to find the 'sandwich artist' was still setting up, hadn't brought the salads out and had no fresh bread. I ordered a sub and got given yesterdays bread. I asked for it to be toasted but the toaster hadn't been cleaned yet so couldn't be used. I was offered to have my bread microwaved instead(?). When I explained I no longer wanted my sub anymore (because I couldn't have fresh or toasted bread) I was treated as if I'd kicked the lady's dog.

Not once did I have to ask for extra cheese or olives and this is the first time in a long time that a subway has actually given me the option of the pizza melt sauce - I normally end up with no sauce. 11/10 well done. Will travel from Sydney again. Quite the unusual experience, I expected a form of public transport but instead received a delightful sandwich far surpassing any other I have had before. If I do say so myself, and I must, the sheer euphoria I experienced while consuming this masterpiece existed on the boundary between transcension and a perpetual oblivion. I advised excited caution when contemplating this culinary delight. Hands down the best subway in the Newcastle area. Always such great quality subs it's unbelievable.

Maybe remind them that you can‚Äôt know what languages someone speaks based on appearance. Worst subway in Newy. Appalling service. Staff are rude, don't listen to instructions for subs, and act put out when anything is corrected. Stingy on the toppings and sandwiches are just slapped together with little care. If you order online, be prepared for your order to be completely wrong! Don't go here. Photos show BLT subs, without bacon despite it being the point of the BLT, from an online order. Staff to busy talking in Hindi and giggling to serve you, $17 and they put literally half of what another subway would put on your sub lucky to be two leaves of spinach,  one slither of onion, can't even see the japoenos or cucumber I ordered  and a tiny slice of avo.... worst consistency with portioning at this subway, they use a wooden fork to portion the seafood salad,(most subway use a ice cream scoop) depending who is on, i have to ask for double meat to get a decent amount and even that consistency changes. They give the least about of lettuce and even counted 6 shredded pieces of carrot before asking for more to be added. I would suggest a bit more care taken when cutting the bread as a lot of times i feel like the bread is mangled after and squash the bread down flat. Absolutely Worst Subway ever, they said they can't do more than 3 sauces. But on the subway app you can clearly select as many sauces as you want. They are obliged to follow the franchise rules and regulations but they are using these cheap tricks to make more money. Also, the subway here is more expensive than any other branch considering they use low grade cheap vegetables. Moreover, the staff is super rude. TOTAL RIPOFF!!",

Lots of seating in the bistro area. Nice big tvs if you want to watch the footy. Queues for ordering dinner can be long, up to 30 minutes but meals came out quickly. Reasonably priced typical bistro meals, nothing too fancy, but members have cheaper options. Lots of pokies if thats your jam.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Nagisa: Our whole experience tonight at Nagisa was nothing less than perfect. Just the best Japanese in Newcastle. High quality menu options, excellent sake and wine list. The service is second to none. if you don't want to go to Japan but want to have amazing Japanese food then you'd better visit here... Recently had a much postponed revisit to Nagisa. We do not live in Newcastle, and too many years had gone by being busy elsewhere.  But at last we managed, and we were not disappointed. The food was beautifully presented, exquisite as always and the service was on point. We only merely dipped into an excellent drinks menu, with a great mix of local stand-up wines, with a fantastic range of Japanese craft beers. The menu was concise, with good traditional staples, but with a contemporary twist. Altogether a delightful evening. We have missed this place. In terms of actual food, decent but a bit salty and nowhere near top Japanese restaurants elsewhere such as in Sydney. Otherwise the location is top notch, hard to find better places in Newy. A bit pricey as well.",

The food was really yummy, the service staff were very nice too. We were coming from Sydney and wanted dinner and it definitely hit the spot! The quantity was good, but the quality was not what I expected at that price. Furthermore, the garden salad was extremely basic; it consisted of just one tomato sliced into 4 pieces, some pieces of cucumber,a few slices of onion, and some lettuce. I felt it was too simple, You have to try this place. Make sure you book table! Omfg just amazing. Waited for our meals 2 hours later, we have hungry kids and other 2 of our adult family didn't get their order due waitress mistaken cancelled order.",

        "Place_Reviews": "The Kent Hotel: Amazing  renovation  fresh clean bright Ordered ‚Äòchicken scallopini‚Äô from the specials board and after eating 4-5 mouthfuls realised it was completely raw chicken. We recently hired the upstairs function space to hold our wedding reception at The Kent, and it was an absolutely fantastic experience from start to finish. Only placed an order for some chips and never received them after waiting for an hour. Had to ask for a refund to which they asked me if I could just wait for the chips. Also was there for a private, pre-paid event but they double booked the area so we were not able to use it even though we already paid for it. A dedicated vegan menu brought us here in a visit from Sydney, and wow it didn't disappoint. We had the mushroom steaks, noodle salad, Corn ribs and ginger beer battered artichokes. The mushroom steaks were sensational, as were the corn ribs. The noodles in the salad were a bit hard like they should have been cooked a little longer and the artichoke tasted a bit too vinegary, so I assume it was the type from the jar in vinegar, a rinse should do the trick to remove a bit more of it and it would have been a great dish. All up we were impressed by the creativity of the menu and the effort to make sure vegans are catered for. We will be back!",

Unfortunately, my last experience did not meet my previous experiences . The service was pretty ordinary ( slow and more take away cafe like) and the food for such a highly rated restaurant did not meet the high standards of what I had previously experienced at Rustica. The atmosphere was nice sitting by the window, however, the service and meals were a little disappointing in quality and flavour. Spending $400 for 4 people I did expect better or on par to my previous visits, it was a notable difference. Maybe it was just an off night for them.... maybe a slip in standards. I'll  give them another go and the benefit of doubt. It has been a while since I have been here and I was hoping that it was as good as before. I was not disappointed. The arancini balls were flavorsome and crunchy on the outside. We had the shared lamb which is a must. A big serve for two people and the lamb falls off the bone. Interesting and crisp potatoes. I took out my bestie‚Äôs parents for lunch when I was visiting Newcastle and Rustica did not disappoint. The scallops were sensational and really, even though 2 of us ate it, the lamb could have easily fed the three of us. Nice venue with great views and friendly service Went there for an anniversary. The staff were lovely. The cocktail I had was divine it was called a sinking ship, I highly recommend. The food was delightful. Would definitely go again. I strongly advise that you book in advance. Can full quick. Passed by on the way to Brisbane, dropped in for a lunch, forgot to get their name but the guy and the lady who served us was lovely and friendly. Food was cooked perfectly and well priced. The Cocktail that was recommended by the bartender, it was awesome. Absolutely loved it.",

Food was fantastic and it is in a great location. Highly recommended and we will be back. Honeysuckle Restaurant offers fantastic food and a lovely atmosphere. The peri peri grilled chicken burger was a highlight‚Äîperfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal! This place is huge!! We booked for dinner for 6.30pm  via the website as I knew it would be busy. ( Australia day) On arrival, we were upstairs, and it was very noisy with a function also there. I spoke to the doorman ( what a great man ) we were directed to the outside area on the eastern end of the verandah.  Great location.  Minimal noise, could not hear the band/singer who I found terrible ( but I am in my early sixties, that might be the reason) the place was very busy. I ordered our meals and drinks via the table QR code. It was perfect delivery to us in no time . Could not fault it. We always return when in Newy. Great place, but it does get busy. I visited on a Friday afternoon at around 4:30pm with two others. It wasn't too busy and we got a nice table by the water with a great view. We ordered some drinks, coffee, chips ($9) and oven-baked Turkish bread ($9). The drinks were nice and good value, the vodka raspberry was especially good. The chips weren't the best but the delicious Turkish bread made up for it. I liked that we could order our drinks from our phones, but it would've been good if we could order food as well. The service was friendly but not very fast. Overall, I highly recommend for the good vibes and views.",

Awesome Staff and service ... the cruise was spectacular and not long enough. We saw seals, dolphins and humpback whales and enjoyed the simple yet lovely morning tea on board. Highly recommend a Nova Cruise. Took a chilled out river cruise with beautiful scenery and friendly staff.  Great way to relax, providing both open air and covered seating. We enjoyed our time on the cruise.  On boarding we were given a free drink card and small desert.  The crew member was friendly.  The stairs are very steep to get to the roof top but at 63 I made it! It was awesome watching the fireworks from the water.  Our friend won the box of chocolates for best glow stick display which was a bit of fun(not the one in the photo lol) Super awesome cruise experience. Totally impromptu plan. We booked a whale watching  2 hour cruise on a public holiday. Was glad to find spots at our convenient time of the day. This is first time whale watching experience and we really enjoyed it. Excellent customer service. We were offered sugar coated ginger and sea sickness tablets in advance, which was really thoughful. We embarked cruise boat from wharf close to Rydges and sailed into the ocean. We saw quite a few whales and some of them breached  which was unexpected‚Ä¶",

If you're looking for a delicious dining experience in Newcastle's central business district, look no further than this hidden gem on King Street. Nestled away in a charming side street, the cozy atmosphere of this restaurant is the perfect place to unwind and enjoy a meal. However, due to its popularity, it's highly recommended to make a booking in advance. The food is as beautiful as it is delicious, with the goat curry being a standout dish that's sure to satisfy. The mango lassi was also delicious.This family-run restaurant has been a local favorite for years, and it's easy to see why. Although prices may be on the higher side ($$), the quality of the food and service make it worth it. Keep in mind that finding parking in the area can be a bit challenging, so plan ahead accordingly. Overall, we highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for an unforgettable Indian food dining experience in Newcastle. A fabulous place to eat, with fresh ingredients. A truly authentic Indian dining experience. Ravi is very welcoming, and you feel more like a family member than simply a diner. Highly recommended. If I had children I'd probably consider sacrificing them for the butter chicken and cheesy garlic naan. I had the butter chicken with medium spice which had a nice gentle kick. The cheesy garlic naan combined well with the sauce from the butter chicken. The staff were very polite, especially considering how much they were under the pump from all of our orders (16 of us).

Wow so simply walked out and will not be walking in there again. What a joke cash is king so if you will not accept cash as a business you will not see me back at your business again. I got delivery from door dash, the rolls had two mini pieces of chicken , unacceptable Ordered two Picklebird burger boxes tonight over Uber Eats, and almost every part of the order was wrong. Neither burger had tomato. One of them didn't even have pickles. It was just chicken, lettuce and sauce. I bought two rippa combos and the bread was really hard and difficult to bite into. Their tenders on the roll are also tiny. Cold Wings and Chilly Reception: A Drive-Thru Disaster at Waratah Red Rooster",

        "Place_Reviews": "Sydney Junction Hotel: Great location, easy parking on site. The pub itself is lovely, well presented, clean & modern. Very inviting for a family lunch, dinner, or a night out with friends. Sadly, the food was incredibly ordinary, overcooked & very dry chicken, salad drowning in dressing, and croutons were so stale they were actually chewy.   For a large venue marketed towards families (they have a nice under cover play area), they apparently have only 2 high chairs, so we struggled to feed our baby while sitting on our laps until another family finished eating and could give up the chair they were using. I'll finish by saying the staff were lovely, however, and did what they could to assist. Service here made me feel not welcome, staff didn‚Äôt know what time weekly specials started. Pub was super modern yet very quiet compared to the others in the area. Schnitzel was average Dianne sauce tasted like it came out of a packet First time here, thought we'd check out trivia night. It was a fun night . Nice fit out. I stayed here for 2nights  after reading other reviews was a little concerned about the noise from bar but but upstairs no noise at all  the staff all where great and the food from the restaurant superb expertly crafted by a master chef Joss he takes pride in his art of food  and that is reflected in tasting the rooms  had all the essentials bathrooms down the hall l will stay again most impressed many thanks to all the staff  a fun place",

        "Place_Reviews": "The Exchange Hotel: We dined at The Exchange Hotel on a Monday night since a friend visiting from out of town was staying nearby. The food was fabulous for pub cuisine, and the service was excellent. Thr Pizza's were amazing and Lucy went above and beyond to organise our lunch for 20 people. She was lovely and accommodating. The pizzas were huge, delicious and huge portion sizes. The renovations look great too. The evening that our small group attended was a quiet one, with that said the level of service was pretty poor. I felt that our small group late 30s and early 40s did not fit in here, as I feel age is not relevant the behavior certainly was, there was an element of immaturity displayed, asking questions about menu and food seem to be just too hard. I love the new (that's new to me) interiors. The bistro upstairs is really nice, and there's the balcony - beautiful. Sunday is sports day and $15 pizzas which is pretty good. I had a Surf and Turf scotch fillet - lovely. Upstairs balcony is lovely setting for dinner.  Menu is diverse to accommodate options for all our table.  Food was delicious and good serving sizes so we weren't looking for more at the end of the meal.  Cocktails were very nice.  Staff very friendly.",

Very accommodating and let us order breakfast dishes (which we were craving) despite it being well and truly lunch time. I had the Turkish Eggs with Eggplant and Paratha, which was a super creative and delicious dish. Highly recommend. My friend has the Chile Scrambled eggs which was more basic and a little disappointing. Staff was amazing, food was amazing as well, I ordered a bacon & egg roll & the bread just melted in my mouth. Great cafe atmosphere was well, everyone was friendly from the person taking my order to the cook. 10/10 highly recommend this spot in Newcastle. Simply one of the top cafes in the Newcastle CBD area. The dishes are well thought out with a twist of flavours. In addition, the coffee will not disappoint! Overall a great brunch! Quality food, great service and nice vibes ü§åüèΩ This place is amazing!! We ordered brunch, coffee, hot chocolate and smoothie, they were beautiful and delicious. Friendly staffs and fast service.

        "Place_Reviews": "Sushinet: The ramen and sushi are always on point. Never had a bad meal here and the service is always exceptional! Middle of the road. I wish I could say more. I love sushi, but not this sushi. The fresh salmon nigiri was fresh, but sadly the salmon and avacodo roll was lackluster. The spicy chicken rolls sadly had overcooked and dry chicken, which made them chewy. There was a limited selection right at noon, more of a variety was expected since the lunch rush would have been starting soon. On the positive side, the sushi was not over-riced, and that was nice. The prices were high for just okay sushi. I did not hate it, but I would not return on purpose. The bibimbap‚Äôs are amazing, taste great and super good value for money and I will continue to buy these quite regularly. Unfortunately,  the same can‚Äôt be said for the sushi, I have purchased different types of sushi from here on different times of the day but I have finally given up on trying to give them the benefit of the doubt as it is consistently bad!! The rice is always hard and inedible. Compared to the local competitors it is priced at a slightly hirer price and the portions signally are less. The staff however are very welcoming and friendly and I will definitely keep coming back for the bibimbap! I eat here roughly twice a week, occasionally more. The ramen is amazing, and they always remember my order. Very friendly! Not the nicest. Chicken in the rolls was hard and didn't seem fresh at all. Not a whole lot of options. A little overrated on google",

        "Place_Reviews": "Market St Basement: Very first time in Newcastle, and we just had to check out one of the best Italian Restaurants. The overall ambiance was very welcoming and vibrant. Photos do not do this place justice (go experience this for yourself). I will say, at the very beginning we were asked ( Still or Sparkling Water) to we replied with, Sparkling ( know that at the end of our night we were charged without knowing $5 for that bottle of Sparkling water). We went here for dinner last Saturday evening with two children under two. The lady and gentlemen that served our table were so extraordinary with their service and how they handled and engaged with the children. The food is always amazing here! One of my favourite places to eat when passing by through Newcastle The best Italian cuisine I have had in many years - and the best Prosciutto pizza ever.  The service and attention to detail were also outstanding.  Make sure you visit with friends who don't mind share plates to keep your food envy at a minimum! My wife and I had the distinct pleasure of dining at The Basement on New Year's Eve. We had been eager to try their menu for a while and were thrilled to get a booking to see out 2023 on a high. We were not disappointed. We arrived 15 minutes early but our host gladly found us a table. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful, explaining the menu and making suggestions when required. Even when not waiting on us, they would acknowledge us with a smile and generally made us feel welcome and catered for. For the entire 2 hours we were there and considering how busy it was, they never made us feel rushed to 'eat, drink and go' High quality Italian food, excellent flavour, wait staff were professional and on top of the tables..",

Very accommodating to our request to a variation on the menu! The food was so yummy I nearly forgot to take a photo! The mango smoothie is delicious!!! I drank that instantly. I had the muesli. Yum! Thank you for a great breakfast! I am not one to write reviews but what a ridiculous excuse of a cafe! I was shocked to be ignored with such awful customer service and the food is even worse. Ruined my day so early with burnt yet weak flavourless coffee and could not even eat my sandwich it was so burnt. If I could rate 0 star I would. Great place for a breakfast. the cuban sandwich is mean! üî•üî• great coffee and nice vibes. love this spot so glad we found it. There were 9 of us on a table (5 kids) so I got to sample everything they didn‚Äôt eat. FANTASTIC! I had the eggs Benedict and it was great! Awesome coffee too üëåüèº The food was fantastic and a really good selection of choices on offer. Burritos, falafel bowls, hearty breakfasts, etc. Good portions too. Only drawback was that service was a little off, dishes came separately and slightly delayed. Other than that a nice cafe!",

        "Place_Reviews": "Rosina's Pizza Restaurant: The food is so fresh and tasty. The service is impeccable. Very busy, I‚Äôll definitely be back, a local secret restaurant. BYO. So well priced We were really looking forward to eating here on our last night in Newcastle, but what a disappointment beyond words. The young guy serving us was so casual, he seemed disinterested. I ordered the Rosina's special pizza. It arrived undercooked - the mushrooms were raw, the cheese hadn't melted, the ham and prawns were cold. I informed the 'waiter' who shoved it back in the oven without a word spoken! Then it arrived again and yes it was hotter in the middle this time, but now with a black charcoal crust. Again no word came from the waiter as it landed on our table! We explained we couldn't eat it because it was burnt, but he told us it was now cooked!! We asked for another one to be made and it eventually emerged and actually tasted delicious. What a shame it couldn't be achieved first time round. Poor service and rubbish experience. Would not return. Ordered a margarita pizza to take away. They have not updated the prices on the board as they have gone up. The pizza did not have a single tomato piece or even any tomato sauce, just herbs and cheese and probably should have been heated for another couple of minutes. This is not what I expected from an Italian restaurant. Will stick to the local pizza chain which was far better tasting and value for price. Avoid unless you are very hungry Great food and atmosphere tiny space that‚Äôs always filled with happy talking customers ‚Äî a favourite for locals feels like Italy highly recommended if you like intimate dining. Still my favourite Italian restaurant in Newcastle. Absolutely beautiful food, every time. Excellent flavours, great recipes. I love watching the art in the kitchen. Such professional cooking but a lovely cosy restaurant that feels like you're in someone's home",

My scallop starter and lemon meringue dessert were 10 out of 10 dishes. Everything on the plate was perfect and accompanied each other perfectly. I was surprised that we could get a last minute table. Highly recommend these guys for an incredible meal. I had my wedding reception here in March and it went wonderfully.

        "Place_Reviews": "Customs House Hotel: Felt like a steak for Sunday night dinner. For a pub there was only one option which was surprising but it was Sunday night. 300g Sirloin with chips and salad. The salad was nothing special but fresh. Chips were how I like them, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. The steak was interesting. A little dry in spots, but not bad. Possibly my fault as I like steaks medium and this was a low fat steak. I like fat on a steak and the parts that had some fat were perfect. Cooked perfectly for a medium steak and beautifully seared on the outside with a nice flame grill. Don't let me sound like I am complaining. If I could cook a steak like this I would be more than happy and so much better than many steaks I have had recently. Staff, venue & atmosphere I rate 5 stars but my meal was sadly only a dismal 2! The staff were so friendly, welcoming & I couldn't fault them. My friends enjoyed their meals but I was very disappointed indeed. I order a warm pumpkin salad & paid $12 more for warm salmon. I'm yet to see any salmon (maybe there were 2 small tea spoons added). The pumpkin was in one big hunk, uncooked & too hard to cut & the salad was a tiny small handful of greens! The flavour was lovely & the 2 little pieces of feta were nice. For the price I expected a WHOLE lot more. Plus the luke warm hot chocolate was served in the smallest cup I've ever seen & NO marshmallows. It's not that hard to have a packet of them handy! I was not impressed... üòû I have been in for lunch a few times now and I can‚Äôt fault anything. The only disappointment I got was when I was too full to finish my food, because it was absolutely delicious. Definitely stop in for a beer. Prices are good and service is great. The view is also very good to watch the cargo ships go by. They also have entertainment on weekends. Great venue. Sadly not impressed. Food was sub par. Chips and sweet potato were good but very salty. Laksa special was terrible. Lots of fresh veg but hardly any soup, noodles still stuck together and 4 pieces of tiny dry chicken as you can see in the photo. Beef Burger was tasteless and small but lots of chips. Cake was the stand out. Salmon was lovely and well cooked but comes with a cold sauce! Horrible!",

        "Place_Reviews": "Susuru Ramen & Gyoza: It‚Äôs located on the side of the road. Easy to spot due to the bright yellow interiors. Plenty of seating available inside. Parking can be a bit difficult as it is a very Commercial Street and there‚Äôs time restricted street parking. Found via tiktok suggestion and had to check it out. Booked a table via google which was super easy. Was seated straight on our arrival. Loads of options and the kids were thrilled with their meals. I was given a complimentary glass of wine as it was mothers day which was absolutely lovely üòä will definitely be back! The tonkotso ramen was delicious Great friendly staff üëç very attentive to kids. Kept kids entertained with Halloween themed goodies. All dishes were yummy especially Korean fried chicken pieces (side dish). Perhaps slightly over priced for size and quality compared to similar Sydney chains. Great location! As I sit here barely able to move, another feast consumed, out of breath from slurping,  I think about how I look forward to do it all again next week. I‚Äôm an addict. There, I admit it! I don‚Äôt know what they put in the broth, but it‚Äôs the most delicious, heart warming soul food. I eat Susuru a least once or twice a week, take away, dine in, Uber eats, the situation doesn‚Äôt take away from its scrumptious flavour. 10/10 always, would recommend. The food was excellent, however, not cheap and small portions of ramen. I understand that it's hard to compare to Sydney but just for reference for those wondering, a ramen can be had on average from $16-$20. Their price of $22 isn't far off,  but the servings in Sydney are 50% larger in noodle serving and broth. Still deserves 5 stars because the taste was spot on and absolutely delicious, the toilets were clean, the staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean. Will definitely be back, but not as regular as I would like due to value.",
