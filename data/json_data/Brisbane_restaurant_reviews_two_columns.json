        "Place_Reviews": "Adina Apartment Hotel Brisbane Anzac Square: I stayed there for 3 nights while on a trip to Brisbane to see family. It is great location, because it's opposite central station, and has bus stops near by, and easy access to all the cbd touristy stuff that you might want to do. The rooms are great. The staff are great. Only downside is that it doesn't have a restaurant which means no breakfast included and no room service. It would be nice if they were able to make arrangements with a restaurant or 2 and/or a cafe or 2 near by to make up for this. That's the only major downside for me. But I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others. We stayed here one night because it‚Äôs close to central station and we needed to get a proper rest before our two day journey back to Europe. Sadly it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant stay. Al six o‚Äôclock in the morning they cleaned the floors outside our room with an incredibly loud carpet cleaner banging it against our walls and door‚Ä¶ We had a quick visit to Brisbane and wanted to stay central to the city. We had a 1 bedroom plus Lounge sofa room.  It was very clean and comfortable, and the location suited us perfectly. The reception staff were excellent. A lovely experience, thank you to the Adina Ann St. team. One of the nicest hotels we've stayed at.  Very conveniently located and quiet rooms that feel fresh, modern and clean. Right in the heart of Brisbane and easy walk to everything. Exec Summ‚Äôy: Definitely recommended when you‚Äôre able to $pend (it‚Äôs a divine experience)",

        "Place_Reviews": "Hotel Diana: Great location for us as we went to a concert at the Princess Theatre! The room was large and well appointed, as was the bathroom, comfortable bed, excellent pillows and towels. Very clean and seemed updated. Large TV, tea making facilities. Very quiet. There are several restaurants next door and there is free parking. Great price. What more can you ask for! I stayed to see a show at the Princess Theatre right next door. The staff were friendly and helpful. There's a great variety of dining options close by, and the hotel offers a great buffet breakfast for $25. We had to stay nearby the Mater Hospital while our little boy was in intensive care, and I honestly could not have asked for a more accommodating, caring and hospitable reception from every one of the team members at the Hotel. We had to make multiple changes due to unpredictable nature of the hospital stay and every single time the staff obliged, exceeded expectations and did it with a smile making us feel like anything we asked was absolutely no problem. Great experience. Lovely staff and yummy breakfast with so many options for vegetarians and vegans too. Danny and his lovely team have always taken care of us all these years we have stayed at the hotel. I can't express my gratitude enough for the wonderful team at this hotel. My husband was air lifted from central Queensland to the Mater Hospital with multiple organ failure. He was not expected to survive. The staff at this hotel bent over backwards to accommodate me and the children and grand babies at this very stressful time. Dan found rooms that didn't seem to be there and spent so much time shuffling rooms to fit us in at different times. His support and encouragement made such a difference to me, especially his kind words every morning as I left for the hospital not knowing what would happen each day. My husband has survived and I can't thank Dan enough for his kindness and compassion, a truly wonderful human being. Service over and above when I really needed it.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Treasury Casino and Hotel Brisbane: I I went to this casino a few times, and it was fine at first until one time I got carried away and lost several thousand dollars. I felt it was time to stop and wanted to sign a self-exclusion. When I took out the self-exclusion I signed last year at The Star Sydney, I found that Treasury Casino was also included. I only remembered the person responsible for the agreement asking if I wanted to include The Crown Casino, but I didn't expect Treasury Casino to be in it as well. Monthly meal specials are generally great. Although last month's steak was chewy and they ran out of the red wine only a few days into the deal last month, rather disappointed when we asked to swap with another Red available they refused and only after we bought our own from the bar outside, they compensated us with a discount. The manager really could have done better. We recently stayed at the hotel, it seriously needs a make over. Dull and bland. We wanted to spend our drinks voucher, the bar was closed at 9 pm when we returned. So that was a waste. We walked into the treasury casino for a drink and somewhere to sit. It didn't seem to have many places to sit down unless yr gambling. Was rather disappointed, but found out it was closing its doors and will be reopening in a beautiful building with gorgeous views of the Brisbane river and Southbank, so hopefully will have plenty of lounge seating to enjoy a cocktail üçπüç∏ Today, I went to the casino with my friends, excited for the visit. Upon arrival, the security staff checked our IDs: I presented my Colombian driver‚Äôs license, which I have always used without issues at clubs, and my friends showed their German IDs. However, we were denied entry because our IDs were deemed invalid. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the day before, we had been allowed entry with the same IDs. When we spoke to the manager, he explained that entry depended on their discretion and was up to their judgment. Unfortunately, we were unable to enter and felt frustrated by the inconsistency in policy enforcement",

Four of us went for lunch to celebrate my husbands 80th birthday. The service was slow. Cauliflower was like rubber. Broccoli I had difficulty cutting with a knife. Seafood served in a bowl so couldn‚Äôt cut ends with a knife. Friendliness non existent. Wow, what a great spot. Amazing food and exceptional service! We stranded there without proper booking (travel agent's fault)  with 2 small children and the manager on duty was tremendously helpful! Thanks! We would have loved to stay at this amazing place ... but did  enjoy a great dinner! I cannot speak higher of this place. Every staff member we encountered were the friendliest, most delightful people.  Truly lovely staff were very accommodating from  arrival (we we early and enjoyed coffees and breakfast while we waited on our rooms?. The food is incredible.  Our one regret was not dining there for dinner as it would've been sensational based on what we sampled for breakfast & lunch. A very eclectic menu and as someone who travels a lot, so pleased to see creative dishes served for breakfast other than eggs any style.  The gentleman at breakfast was so warm & sweet with my elderly parents as too was Murray. We felt like we were staying with a family host. I truly hope Management reads this and knows the staff at Spicers Balfour are commendable and truly make this hotel a perfect 10 in my opinion.  Also shout out to the lovely bar waitress who was so friendly and sweet. Great location, quick, easy walk to Howard Wharves and river ferry terminal (free city hopper stop).",

I dealt with Bryn, who was very unhelpful in his replies. I called to discuss his responses and he claimed the room was \"greasy and grimy\", which was ridiculous given we only stayed for 2 nights, were out most of the day, and didn't cook in the kitchen. On arriving to check in I was told that the secure parking was full and was told to park on the street. No street parking available and we had to park at McDonald‚Äôs down the road and walk back to the apartments with our luggage and a 3 & 5 yr old. Our room was very run down, the lounge was broken, paint was coming off the coffee table, the door onto our balcony could not be locked as half the locking system was completely broken off. The kitchen cupboard doors don‚Äôt close properly, used cutlery left unwashed in dishwasher. Hole in bathroom door with a sign over it ‚Äúmaintenance aware‚Äù.

Food was excellent, steak was cooked perfect, staff were friendly and accommodating. Only complaint about room was broken tap in bathroom.  Beds were great and loved little patio. One employee in bottle shop was quite rude to us when there was absolutely no need for this. We have stopped here a couple of times with my Wynnum mate for a bite to eat before going across the road to the Bayside Cinemas. Our choice was the covered beer garden area with bar service, and order food at the table QR code. Good service, good food, and nice atmosphere. If I could give this pub a negative rating for service I would. We walked to this pub after a lovely night at a comedian. When arriving we got some drinks and went and sat in the back of the smoking area. This was only around 10pm. We then hear a yell from a man at the door saying we have 5 minutes to finish smokes and get back inside. This was a disgusting way to speak to a bunch of ladies I assumed he may of been speaking to a louder bunch closer to the door. Then a few minutes pass by and we are getting yelled at to get back inside the smoking area is closed. Everyone was confused so the staff member continues swearing and says that it‚Äôs routine cleaning they do this every night and we need to get out. Half of us had not had any alcohol and were treated so poorly by staff with no respect - For no reason we had only just arrived. I sympathise with staff of a pub as I‚Äôm sure they deal with a lot of grumpy drunk people but the way they spoke was shocking to say the least. Disgusting service, awful way to end a night. I will not be returning here and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend any one else visit either.",

My room was very well presented & a suitably presented light breakfast for next morning. Good to be able to park in backyard for more security. Well recommended for a night stay or longer. Well positioned to access places easily. I've stayed here a few times. It's good value and the location is very convenient. There is public transport on your doorstep and and you are within a short walk of two different entertainment / food precincts. There's also supermarkets very close by as well as a 24 hr petrol station & a 24hr Micky Dee's. The house is solidly built so you wont hear the people in the next room. This is a really lovely setting and located in a quiet street close to Brisbane city. The room was clean, comfortable and the host was very friendly. Highly recommended. This \"hotel\" can be totally different to what you could expect to be... There was nobody welcoming in the entrance or any friendly sign, it seemed like a creepy abandoned house, and when we went to main entrance to knock the door the housekeeper just told us why we did not get in from the backyard door as that door was open.  The room has all the basic you could need and was pretty clean but the breakfast was not what we were expecting.... Basically just packed cereals and bread, no fruits or any other facility, besides of the fact that you need to make everything by your own, this is not well explained in the Booking sites.  We just checked out from this hotel leaving the keys in the room door because the housekeeper was too much strange to going to look for her. I stayed there 4 nights and it was really comfortable! Everything is well  organized.",

Check in and check out was effortless. I stay here often and it just gets better. Highly recommended and really good value. The staff are consistently welcoming and knowledgeable. Staying on the edge of the inner city was great. The free shuttle bus to Queen Street is at the front door.  We had dinner at the hotel one night and it was exceptionally good.  Drinks downstairs in the alfresco area most afternoons was also very pleasant under the heaters.  Would recommend and will stay again. Location isn't perfect unless you like walking slopes every day for at least 5 minutes from Roma Street Station. What a great addition to the ACCOR group.  Well located with fabulous views.  The room was quiet with a large balcony.  Staff were impressive and always keen to serve.  The restaurant offered a nice breakfast and good Italian food options.  I didn't use the pool (winter stay) I was in Brisbane for 5 nights on business, never stayed at this particular premises and was pleasantly surprised with the stay. All the amenities I am seeking, nothing too hard for staff,  quality service and products.

Only gripe is I wish the courses could have been spaced apart,  having them served in quick succession felt very rushed. In all it was an excellent evening. I recently celebrated my birthday at C'est Bon, and I must say, I was not disappointed. True to its name in French, the food is indeed delicious. The chef's selection menu offers a wide variety of dishes that guide you through the menu seamlessly. It's a great value for money, with a fantastic atmosphere and attentive service that pays close attention to detail. I highly recommend this restaurant! What a fantastic French restaurant.  1st time for lunch and the food, service (thanks Grant) ambience and wine selection were wonderful.  The oysters were exceptional, and 2 favourites were the wagyu tartare with truffle (added) and the quail main dish... both exceptional.  Everything was great and highly recommend. Went to C‚Äôest Bon for dinner. It was a cold night but it was colder inside than outside. As soon as you were taken into the restaurant, it hit you. We raised this with the person who showed us to our table and she responded that the waiters get hot running back and forth. But she adjusted the air conditioning and it made an immediate effect. However, she was right as the waiters soon adjusted the control back to cold. It is extremely rare to see people eating with their puffer jackets on! That‚Äôs how cold it was.",

It's so convenient to the shopping centre and bus terminal to get into town. We usually stay on the spacious caravan sites but this time we stayed in a cabin.

Very lucky to be surrounded by some great restaurants and Thai Terrace is one of them. They also accepted 8 split bills without any fuss. Went for dinner with friends.  The place was totally empty, the service was non existent, the chicken pad see ew had no chicken in it and the calamari was cold.  Very disappointing all round.  I see the owner comments on these reviews so if you're reading this get some staff who actually want to wait on customers and not sit behind the counter ignoring them and put some meat in your meat dishes.  It's not that hard. We had dinner to this restaurant on Sunday night, it was the worst experience we ever had from foods to service. The Pad Thai we ordered tasted like instant noodles and very sweet,  We asked for fresh chilli to make it tastes better but we were given with sweet chilli sauce which it made it worst and it took 10minutes to arrive.

Me and my boyfriend we spent some days there and the courts in was broken and pierced we couldn‚Äôt close the courtain, they told us they will fix for us, but nothing happened. Room 1405 - Close to the CBD, comfortable, great balcony view of city facing north, huge bath/ shower, very comfortable bed, full smart tv all for $130. Would stay again. As someone who's been working/staying in different hotels from 3 to 5 stars in Southeast Asia & Australia I can confirm: this is the worst hotel/motel that we've ever stayed in our lives. Have a very bad experience with this hotel , water was coming from the floor , terrible room and hygienic was not available. Receptionist are rude, most of them are so arrogant. Not very clean place, floors and the bench tops were all sticky like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned in months.",

Absolutely appalling response when calling to let the staff know they had messed up our order and that when receiving it delivered only 4 min away from my house that it was stone cold. The staff member that answered the phone didn‚Äôt even acknowledge that it was McDonalds I was calling. It was ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù I had to ask if this was McDonalds. The lady then began to yell at me telling me she is only 19 years old before hanging up on me. Absolutely disgusting. This is the second time in 2 weeks we have orders from the Cleveland store and it has arrived could and or wrong order. I rarely give 1 star but this by far is the worst maccas ive been to and I'm hoping with this review McDonald's in Cleveland will take notice. Always served flat and warm drinks cold chips and on the verge of stale burger buns. Quality very poor. Shrinkflation hits Maccas again...big probs with the new big mac menu aren't your fault but still getting the order wrong and half portions of fries? They didn't have half a star option, so I had to choose 1 star.. Take the 24-hour sign down and put it in the bin with your service. I just wanted some below average food, but I couldn't even get that cause they weren't serving any food at 3:30am",

We love the chili con carne as a side to anything we order! People always go for the burritos and the enchiladas but in my opinion the empanadas are a quiet winner. They are cooked well and very flavourful - I always order guacamole and sour cream on the side as well. The salad in the empanadas is perfect to cut the richness in between bites. The food is amazing and I frequently visit this restaurant. Service, food quality and the overall seating arrangement is all too good!",

We called and made our order and was told there was a 45min wait. Upon arrival they had one of our dishes as a Tikka Masala instead of Vindaloo. Had to wait another 20min. Super bland madras and vindaloo. The hot vindaloo was not spicy at all. Thin sauce for both. Saffron rice tastes and looks like it has no spices in it. The vegetable samosa was nice. This was my first time trying this restaurant and I won‚Äôt be back! We were a group of six that dined here for the first time on the weekend. We were welcomed by the young staff member who showed us to our seats inside. It is quite noisy inside when people are talking so we sat outside. The waitress was very helpful when we asked for something not the same, as the menu. In the end we stuck with the menu and she gave us good suggestions. The food was served very quickly, and was very tasty and enjoyable. The one dish that was suggested was goat. As we have never tried goat before we took her up on her suggestion. Didn't rate it. Everything else was excellent. As a first-time visitor to Namaste Indian at Eatons Hill, we were delighted with the experience. Although it is a small venue at the back of the small shopping centre, we found a gem of Indian flavours. It was a balance of spices and seasonings and full of flavour. Then aromatics of the chicken tandoor, creamy curries, with every bite being a delight for the senses. The menu offered a wide variety of options across the Indian flavour range. The chef special goat curry was absolutely scrumptious. Namaste is without a doubt the best Indian Restaurant around. Have been going here for years and have turned so many of my friends and family onto them as well. They make authentic, delicious food and have the most friendly service. They are amazing Delicious food. This Indian restaurant will not disappoint. It‚Äôs an absolute gem and we will continue to support such a great little place in Eatons Hill.",

It is one of these places where you can see they truly care about their guests, and they want to make your stay as pleasant as possible. From now on, every other place I stay in will be judged against this one. Heritage house with spacious clean rooms. Perfect location, walking distance to supermarkets, restaurants and other amenities. So many little details to love about it. It is clear the care and love they put into everything. The 'chef-inspired' breakfast is to die for! Well worth the price you pay altogether. This is my 'go-to' B&B from now on whenever I'm in Brisbane. 10/10! Comfortable and well located accommodation in Brissie. Very good value with a charming and well mannered proprietor. If I was to have an honest whinge, there was no milk in our room for a coffee. That being said it's probably our own fault as we arrived early and he had to rush to get us in . Parking is limited. Always a very relaxing stay. Professionally run by Geof who goes out of his way to make everyone feel welcome. Helpful with tourist information & the latest happenings in Brisbane. Located so close to the city & the valley, although still amazingly quiet. The breakfast is always yummy with little changes so it is never boring if you are a regular. Awesome heritage home so well set up for a B & B. Very comfortable and wonderful host. Breakfast is excellent the best ever when staying at a B & B.

        "Place_Reviews": "punjabi Indian Restaurant: Wawa (wow in Hindi) HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Always dine in though!! The dine in food is exceptional Indian cuisine and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing curry. I cannot say a bad thing about their dine in food as it has been consistent and exceptionally fantastic. The service is also very good with the waitress being extremely polite. Please consider the dine in food is quite different to  the takeaway/delivery experience. We have eaten here a lot over the last few months and can safely say that dining in is the only way to eat this food. I've read reviews about their delivery service and I can tell you they are not wrong. We ordered delivery and they had forgotten some of our order but thankfully we live close enough that it wasn't too much of an inconvenience. They did give us a free can of coke which was a nice gesture.  We've had takeaway and whilst it is still good food it is a 'watered' down version of their dine in curries and their naans are never as fresh and can sometimes be overly chewy. It did also take just over an hour for the food to be delivered. I do not want to deter anyone too much from getting takeaway from here but I would advise that if you are after the proper food experience you should dine in. Dine in 5/5 - Takeaway 3.5/5 - Delivery 2/5 Good service with friendly staff and quick meals. However both curries were very sweet (they shouldn't have been sweet at all), almost disgustingly so. I don't understand why they feel the need to dump so much sugar in at some of these restaurants. It's not authentic and tastes horrible. Behind the sweetness the flavours were quite nice. Will never go back. Worst service. The waitress was so rude. We went around their lunch break time, and she kept coming back to our table every 2 minutes to say \"the restaurant is closing soon\" as soon as our dish arrived. We tried to order more naan but she refused and said the kitchen is closed now. Then she started cleaning our dishes before even asking if we were done. This all happened less than 20 minutes of sitting down. We just wanted to leave at that point so we paid and was leaving, and she yelled at our back saying \"Wait! Is the card approved?\" and held us at the door as if we would run off without paying for 20 something dollar lunch. Such a shame, used to go here all the time and recommended this place to friends, would never be back after this horrible experience and I recommend you do the same. Have eaten at this indian restaurant a couple of times, each being good. The butter chicken is by far the best dish, creamy and not too spicy. Garlic naan is also a favourite.  The service received here was okay, with the server returning throughout the meal to check if we were going alright.  Ambience inside the restaurant could be improved however it was acceptable.  Will definitely return, authentic Indian at a reasonable price.",

The Arancini and Calamari were both delicious, the pizza had a great base and delicious topping, the pasta was incredible and fresh, and the steak was good for its price point.

The service and accommodation was great. We Stayed in the 3 bedroom apartment and couldn't get over the space we had. The only issue I would say is the parking. Only a limited spot to park. Coming back late there was no guest parking left and had to park outside. Can't understand why each unit should have their own spot. But besides that would recommend staying here. Will be staying there again. Brilliant! Love the location, Love the rooms, Love the secure car park. Highly recommend this place. We‚Äôre already booked again. The Chinese restaurant is an absolute must do and the little bar is a nice quiet spot to unwind with a cold beer at the end of the day. Much appreciated. Friendly staff l, room was comfortable and clean. Pleasant stay Check-in and check-out was effortless and excellent. Room and facilities was clean and tidy. Springwood Tower is still my first preferance place to stay in Brisbane.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Malt Dining & Bar: I tried the crispy duck and ham for starter and the roasted pumpkin for main and the chocolate brownie (decorated for my birthday) for desert. All three were really tasty and yummy. Nice atmosphere and professional staff as well. The service was amazing, so friendly and professional and made us feel like a regular. The venue is so homely and with a style that almost makes you forget you‚Äôre in the city! I was most pleased I got the table I asked for in the restaurant! But the food, oh my goodness. The food was incredible! My wife is a foodie, I wouldn‚Äôt say I am but even I got lost in the flavours, textures and presentation! Just amazing, we had the best night and will be going back more often that‚Äôs for sure! Very delicious food, friendly and professional service, the elderberry cocktail was amazing. Everything was amazing. The atmosphere is a blend of traditional and modern, being in an historical building with abstract modern art and the soundscapes were easy on the ear. Comfy velvet chairs add to general ambience of understated class and style. Absolutely excellent whisky and dining experience. We chose to dine in the bar area and were so pleased with our choice. So many excellent whiskies to choose from, along with delicious food cooked to perfection. Outstanding service by staff. Highly recommend I booked the private cellar option for 16 people 17th Wednesday 2024. The menu for lunch chosen was the premium Chef‚Äôs Feast to cater for the big eaters in our group, I also added a 3rd protein to the main courses. Everyone of my clients raved about how good the food was in terms of quality but also quantity. Super happy with Malt Dining for providing such a great experience for our large group!",

The service was outstanding and all the staff was super friendly and helpful, the rooms had a boutique feel to them which I loved they were also very unique in a good way. the fragrance they put throughout the hotel was phenomenal I have never smelt a better hotel. The parking was not on site, but it was very close to the hotel, which was awesome. The services that were also included with the rooms was exceptional , especially the free lolly bar that my kids loved. Very happy with our stay at the Inchcolm. Front desk staff are super and made everything easy and comfortable both in the hotel side and the bar. The evening social hour is a nice touch. Room is very comfortable, clean, and we slept well. Great location just a few steps from the central train station. This hotel is a great find. Don't bring kids here. The Inchcolm is an incredibly beautiful venue that I am so happy to have booked for my wedding. We booked the entire hotel and so had a lot of the wedding guests staying in the hotel and they treated everyone with the same care. They left champagne not only in the bridal suite but in the rooms of the wedding party too.",

The cafe has a wonderfully inclusive vibe and the treats at the counter are divine. I have used In a Pickle for catering several times and I highly recommend this as well. The sweets and cakes are so tasty and the savoury sandwiches and hot items are big crowd pleasers! Can't wait to go back again! The vegan bowl was AMAZING. Enough said. It‚Äôs been a few weeks since I had the pleasure of having brunch here and going through my photos I was reminded of the deliciousness I experienced. I had to share. Spectacular I love everything about in a pickle, from the awesome cakes, divine breakfast and caring service, I also absolutely love their takeaway meals so good the massam curry  and lasagne are the best. Also their catering is just next level. My favourite. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

        "Place_Reviews": "Friday's Riverside: Friday's Riverside function room was fantastic! We attended a birthday party here and the view was definitely the highlight of Friday's. From the balcony your view is directly out to the river and the Story Bridge. The room was a great size for a more intimate sized party and there were plenty of seating options (mainly bar type stools). The food was tasty and there was great selection of vegetarian/vegan and meat finger food options, and the private bar was fantastic. The staff were friendly and moved around the guests well with the food. The person behind the bar was friendly and had a good knowledge of wines, etc, that were being offered. By the time the party had finished the main area of Friday's had music playing and people dancing. This was not distracting in the private function room and looked like everyone was having a fun night! Highly recommend Friday's for your next function! Frequent at Fridays regularly as it's a chilled place to wine and dine and who can go past the awesome view of the Storey Bridge. The staff are acceptional, friendly and attentive and make the experience of dining there even better. Highly recommend. Advertisement said djs would be playing.  Got there only one other couple thought it was closed no music no vibe it was a bit depressing.  Food was quite nice but the cocktails were probably largely fruit juice so doubt I'd go back.  Location is fabulous right on the river.  Need to seriously up their game if they want to compete with the other bottomless brunch venues. Recently visited Fridays for lunch. Great spot with an amazing view of the Story Bridge. Staff are friendly and very attentive. Food was yummy - can recommend the beef burger or steak sandwich. Terrible experience here. A friend of mine accidentally pulled their vape out at the OUTDOOR bar, and put it away after realising they couldn‚Äôt use it. Security instantly kicked them out despite the fact they didn‚Äôt even use it. You lost about 8 people and a couple hundred dollars worth of drinks, nice!",

Today I had the pleasure of putting fuel in my car. Whilst the act itself is pretty boring the beautiful, respectful nice crew made the experience. I don‚Äôt often leave a servo feeling impressed these days but I really felt that this BP really prioritised good old fashioned customer service. Was served by Brett, Thankyou for showing me that customers are still valued. Im an uber driver, Stay away from this servo, their fuel is the most expensive in Brisbane 100 % The staff are always so friendly - the young lady on shift around 6pm yesterday had the best customer service I've experienced in a while. Whoever is hiring staff there is doing a great job. Sadly their pumps are often out of order and I feel their fuel prices often a smidge higher than other places... but I understand it's a super convenient location close to the CBD so also expect to pay a little more.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant was very lively and well decorated. The perfect place for a great night out :) A special mention to Olivia and Zoe for the great customer service! The customer service at the Jetty was A1, the lady serving us was exceptional and accomodating. My friends and I enjoyed the food and it was well priced. Coffee was great and a bonus point for not taxing on the iced coffees. We had a lovely breakfast this morning. Eggs Benedict on potato gems with smoked salmon and the smashed avo on toast with crispy bacon on the side. Coffee was great also (including my decaf). Lovely staff members. A good view of the river, nice place to sit and chat and watch the world go by. Lots of walkers, runners, cyclists and dogs üòä Perfect place for a date night or cute celebration. Have a nice waterfront view while you eat. The food tasted amazing. Filled of flavour and super tender. Even the beans tasted good (I don't usually like beans). There is some parking close to the venue other wise a small walk for meter parking. Will be coming back. Stopped at the restaurant next door last night for just desserts and a cocktail. As it was late they didn't want us (they had 8 tables still eating) so we tried our luck here at The Jetty. Not a problem even though they only had 2 tables left. We felt welcome even though they were winding down for the evening. The desserts and cocktails were amazing. So good that I have come back today for lunch. I am killing time before heading back to the airport so taking my time ordering starters one at a time reading my book overlooking the river views. The staff are friendly and accommodating. So glad we were rejected next door The Jetty is an absolute joy to dine in. The menu having so many choices that were GF was an extra bonus. Highly recommend.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Subway: Ordered 2 subs and a salad, one sub ended up having chicken pieces instead of beef meatballs, other sub ended up having a copious amount of some kind of spicy Chipotle sauce instead of ranch. I did give up on this store last year, as their prices were  inconsistently high despite the same order each and every time.  I have seen many staff members come and go from this store, it was always under staffed. Thankfully that has all changed, the staff are familiar, super friendly, organised and customer focussed, and the long queues have disappeared.  Their prices are now in line with correct Subway prices. The guy who runs the store is fantastic, it has made a big difference, he cares about his customers and makes them feel important and well taken care of.   It's now a pleasure going back to this store, and my son can order his regular sub without being over charged. Never fails to disappoint. Even when there is no other customers and no pending uber eats orders the sandwiches are just throw together. Toppings are buched up and subs don't get toasted properly. Slop! Pictured is a toasted meatball sub. Very polite BUT, BUT didn't toast the bread when asked to be toasted and put wrong toppings on the sandwich and didn't properly fold the wrapper so I nearly lost my sandwich, they need to focus on training there staff more Not my favourite subway but it still worked. I have to get a gluten free wrap and some staff are better at wrapping that and keeping it together than others. This subway doesn‚Äôt have a huge amount of seating but its easy parking and nice staff.",

But if you after good Asian food, there‚Äôs plenty elsewhere better in Brisbane and for at least half the price. Salmon was overpowered by mandarin etc. Laksa was tasty but lacking any real punch in flavour that you‚Äôd expect. Dim Sum and tofu just average. Chicken salad was super tasty!! It‚Äôs a nice spot but no where near the price tag. Would I return? No‚Ä¶ Have been to Fat Noodle few times now. It‚Äôs located inside Treasury in Brisbane city. Have tried most of their dishes and member‚Äôs specials. Their peking duck pancakes, fried rice and Thai salad is quite delicious. Over the many years I have absolutely enjoyed the Fat Noodle Member specials. It‚Äôs such good value for money and they do not compromise in the quality and the flavours of the dishes. I leave feeling satisfied every time.  We do order off the menu too. I don‚Äôt like to pay too much for Bahn Mi but that Crispy Pork Belly was just so tasty.  The service is great too. Even when they are extremely busy the staff are there to accommodate. Thank you to all the staff and the chefs for your amazing hard work. I highly recommend the food here.

        "Place_Reviews": "La Madrina Pizza: Superb pizzas the couple times we‚Äôve ordered. Ham is a bit tasteless though. These are the best pizzas in the greater Brisbane area. Do yourself a huge favour and go to La Madrina for your pizzas. Quality ingredients and made with love. Consistently mouth watering pizzas and have been for many years. Impeccably clean and friendly professional service. As I said, the best pizzas in the greater Brisbane region and the best pizza I have eaten. We recently ordered the family-sized \"Outback\" pizza from La Madrina and wanted to share our experience. Firstly, the pizza is generously sized, making it a good choice for family or group dining. The price, at $31, may seem a bit on the higher side, but it's justified by the ample portions and the liberal amount of toppings they use. It's always great to see a pizza that doesn't skimp on the good stuff! Awesome pizza but for some reason they never answer the phones on a Friday night, not the first time I‚Äôve had this issue‚Ä¶. I have always enjoyed the pizza...never disappointed,  5 stars for pizza. But tonight I thought I'd try some pasta, carbonara. It was very average in flavour, the take away container was half full and cost me $18.95. At least give me a full container with a bit more flavour for that price . Quite a let down!!",

I ordered the shakshuka baked eggs,  very tasty dish. Coffee is Merlo , flavour was good. Service spot on. Seating outside where you can sit with your dog or plenty of indoor seating available The pulled pork tacos OMG they were so good‚Ä¶ who thought to pack everything in a roti because they were onto something real good. Super flavourful, great portion sizes if not a little more than you‚Äôre paying for. We also tried the donuts which were incredibly chocolatey and sweet, could only have one at most but perfect for those who have a sweet tooth. Chai latte was one of those deconstructed ones lol Gorgeous place, coffee was delightful, food was also good. Even though it was busy we were seated pretty promptly. But experience marred because of our very odd waiter. He asked if we were OK then said he's too busy when we started ordering, when he took our order after practically having to force it on him he stood like a mile away so I had to yell my order over all the noise of the cafe. Thinking back I don't know whether to laugh or frown, felt like a prank. First time visitor to this venue and it was a good experience.

I strolled up to the counter to look at the menu. I was greeted by a friendly staff member who then took my order. It was early and there was plenty of seating to choose from both inside and out. I ordered scrambled eggs on toast, which is served on lovely thick toast. Eggs were pretty good. Also ordered a flat white which was also nice and hot, with a good flavour. Lots of choices for both breakfast and lunch. I have been here a few times and bought clients who I take out and not had a too bad experience, however today was different. The staff were miserable behind the counter. I ordered the vegetarian  breakfast and told them that I don't eat bread would they be able to take it off and put something else. Immediately it was \"no, we can't swap for another item\", I would need to pay for it. I also ordered a piccolo,which was a teaspoon of coffee and the rest milk and froth! Nothing like anywhere else, when the food arrived I was so disgusted! On the plate was about 10 wilted spinach leaves with one cut up cooked mushroom on top,one very small poached egg, the smallest tomato they could of found, cut in half and cooked, all for $16.90!! What a rip off! Because I was quite hungry I ate it, i should of sent  it back and got a refund.. The older lady who was will me was also disgusted at the portion size, she was going to order a cake but saw how small the cake slices were! Relaxed atmosphere with staff who have always been tremendously attentive to Cafe guests. It's more like visiting old friends than going to a Cafe. Very enjoyable, and they always interact well with children and oldies alike. My wife and daughter are Ceoliacs. The owner and the Chef could not have been more supportive. We have eaten there twice now and will continue to go back. Very flexible with the menu and will talk through how they prepare and cook the food.  Oh BTW the food is great too. I am a customer and have tried uno caffe multiple times and well being at the caffe I have and witnessed on several occasions the bosses treating staff with disrespect. This behaviour made me feel uncomfortable and as though staff are not treated fairly or with respect. Recently I went their with my partner to order food and the food was nice and coffee was amazing and the staff there are lovely but they are not treated right, I will not be returning to this cafe as it makes me feel uncomfortable.Although  girls that work their are lovely, and make the place feel welcome I just  that stuff are treated unfair",
