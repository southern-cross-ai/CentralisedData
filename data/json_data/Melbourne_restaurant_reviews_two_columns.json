The shower was super small and only just got in the shower door, some people just wouldn't be able to fit in through the shower screen door Staff were friendly enough and the location is good, one of the elevators was out of service, my room had leftovers in the fridge (pierced milk cartons) from the previous person still in the room. The bathroom was small with black mould, and I was locked out of my room multiple times because my key card stopped working, not very convenient and quite frustrating having to go down and get it replaced each time. My First Stay on my own was in Small rooms with even smaller bathrooms. But great location! In the free tram zone, few minutes from Southern Cross Station and Skybus.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Amora Hotel Riverwalk Melbourne: Fantastic stay, highly recommend!! Stayed on Saturday night. Room was ok - clean but extremely dated, TV was barely working. Shower in the bath - really needs renovation. Stunk of old cigarette smoke in the hallway to get to the room very off putting. The front desk staff could improve their welcoming and helpful attitude. Our business conference experience was marred by technical issues with the projector, causing us to lose valuable time and momentum. Unfortunately, no one seemed to take notice or address the situation with the water rifles. Wow.  Just wow.  Last minute booking for an event for 20 people.  The staff all did an absolute amazing job to pull this together and arrange a room, food and drinks with only an hour notice.  Will definitely be booking here in the future. Thank you, thank you and Thank you.  To anyone looking at booking an event, it‚Äôs a no brainer -book here!! I have been here a few times for meetings. They have a lot of event spaces as well as the rooms to stay with parking. They also have a great selection of drinks at the bar and decent food and service at the restaurant. An institution in bridge road!  The location is great as there are lots of nature and all that you need at the door front as well as the capital city trail next to the river for walking. Also Creswick reserve is not too far!",

Beautiful food served in a gorgeous setting, like a Ralph Lauren store if Ralph Lauren had a beach chic vibe. Sam our waiter was absolutely perfect. We ordered oysters, the T Bone. crispy skin barramundi, crab ravioli, wedge salad and asparagus. The ravioli was to die for. Perfect balance of the sweetness of the crab and the lemony tartness of the sauce. T Bone and the fish was cooked perfectly. The T Bone was charcoal grilled and served with crispy wedge potatoes and baby lettuce. All of this was against the backdrop of the beach and the sea. Excellent service, friendly staff, great atmosphere and a wonderful vibe. Extraordinary great food and it has a awesome view of the bay. love the vibe and very friendly staff and perfect location for a beach day. The food is good but with the price they charge I expect better presentation. Just be aware that a glass of sparkling water will be $12. Donovans is absolutely sensational. If I could give Donovans 6 stars I would. The whole meal was wonderful from start to finish. The food was outstanding and the wine was absolutely excellent. If you are having a special occasion dinner, Donovans should be the place to go! I cannot wait to go there again!!!",

The Grand Hotel is a 5 minute walk to the casino and Convention centre so ideally located for us on this trip. Tram stop not far away either. The rooms are large and very comfortable the double glazing keeps the city sounds at bay. The front desk staff are very knowledgeable about Melbourne and had lots of ideas if you care to ask. Overall we love this place for its strong heritage value and we will definitely be coming back next visit. Great staff, easy and fast check-in and check-out.  Beautiful old building with high ceilings and the world's longest corridors.  The place is very grand.  The rooms are huge compared to modern hotels and are well equipped.  This one had a full kitchen and even a large fridge.  Secondary windows have been installed behind the original ones so it's double glazed and very quiet but they open if you want which is nice.  A hand written welcome card from Denis along with some lindt chocolates was a lovely touch that made me smile.  Perfect location as a base, I'll stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. Amazing service from the friendly staff. Nice old style rooms with plenty of amenities. Perfect location next to the train station with tons of food/shopping options nearby. Highly recommend! Beautiful old hotel, room was maybe 3.5 stars, lots of maintenance needed. Lots of space and bright and airy. We had a room on the southern side and the trains are pretty loud. They are really only noticeable in the day , but it‚Äôs definitely not calming or relaxing while they are grinding around the corner. For the price though, it was great. Maybe a room up the street would be perfect?",

Shared starters of cheesy, garlic and herbs pizza (note this is one of my favourite things to eat, and if it's on a menu I'm ordering it!), mixed olives and arancini.  Mains I had vegetarian penne, husband had seafood pasta while others had vegetarian risotto and steaks (one with dmsakad abd onw with chips).  Drinks - Proseccos, red wines, ber, cokes and coffees (decaf soy latte and flat whites). Also cannoli and vanilla gelati.  Hadn't been to La Camera in years so good to go back.  Really great position in Southgate so nice views.  Lots of seating too.  However husband was quite sick later and only thing he had different that could have possibly caused this was the seafood.  Didn't eat anything else after lunch so...... Good selection of food and drinks on the menu. Delicious food, nice view from the balcony. Great size restaurant with indoor & outdoor seating, we sat outside on the balcony with a nice view of the Yarra, was a shame the weather wasn‚Äôt great & the blinds were down. This has to be one of the worst restaurants on the southbank I have been to Firstly, the food was incredible. I think It's hard to have dinner at a place where you would rate every single course of the night 5 stars, but the pizza and lasagne were excellent, and the dessert, tiramasu  and gelati were perfect üëåüèª.",

You can also hear the music from downstairs on some nights but it is not too bad. It is more of a party hostel though so people can enter the room at several times throughout the night.

I would like to thank this hostel and the people who welcomed me, a big thank you to you! I stayed there a few months ago, it was my first day in Melbourne, even in Australia, with very poor basics in English and Anna, whom I can never thank enough, really took the time to help me . Even when I had problems they gave me time to rest after 25 hours of traveling to resolve them afterwards! At the slightest problem they were there to meet my expectations, I hope Anna sees this message because I am super grateful for the help she gave me. I highly recommend this hostel, the people are kind and patient, it's clean and the breakfasts are good! The rooms, like the showers and the common areas are also clean, there is nothing to say, perfect! Without forgetting the atmosphere and the location! I would come back without hesitating !!

However, our 2 bedroom apartment was nothing like the pictures on the website.  Pictures showed a full kitchen with island bench but we had a minute galley kitchen which if 2 people were sitting at the kitchen side of the dining table, meant that you couldn't open the oven or dishwasher doors. Hotel location not bad for us. super noisy due roads and bulding work being carried out at the hotel. higher managment not that helpful as english was their second language and didn't fully understand what I was complaining about. cleaning of rooms terrible, stuff on the the floor for the full 2 weeks we were there. pillows rubbish and very hard, not able to get a great night sleep due all the circunstances, builders started at 0730 every morning. marks on the bed linen etc. absolutely not value for money, do not advise staying here. Attended event on a Saturday. Event catering is standard - fresh and tasty as you'd expect.  Facility is a little older, but everything works.  Function Room is L-shaped. Only constraint is that it is upstairs and there's no lift or ramp access should you need it. Ran a 2 day Evidential Mediumship workshop in their function room that was catered for with morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea. Our 30 delegates were very impressed with the service, attention to detail and care that was provided. Thank you Manju, the brilliant Harry and your team for helping make our workshop event a success. Surprisingly, homely with very accommodating and helpful staff.  A good business hotel.

I have always loved the atmosphere around Richmond/CBD - this visit was definitely worth our while. Looking forward to more frequent visits here. I don't know why it took me so long to try eating here.  It was really good.  It's a big restaurant with quite an extensive menu and reasonably good, attentive service (other than when it took them forever to clear away the dishes after walking past us multiple times and never looking at us).  The food was delicious and I'd love to try it again.  Everything we ate was really good and we were all happy with our meals.  We will be back. Unfortunately quite disappointing. On one hand the gluten free roti was very good, the serving size of the rice was generous and the price is fair. As for the rest, not great. Ordering a small meal took quite a while to order and receive. When we did get our beef tikka masala it was terrible quality meat that felt like it had come straight out of a freezer. The waitress admitted it had been frozen so 2 stars for the honesty rather than 1. Heard a lot about this place and it was good to finally make it for dinner with a group of friends.. lot of options for both vegetarians and non vegetarians with a good mix of different drinks as well.. food was very good and tasty and well sized portions with decent pricing.. spacious place with ample dining capacity.. the vegetarian platter could have been a lot better with the choice of inclusions and wasn't as great as the non vegetarian platter... only area of improvement as such was the wait time to serve the food from the time of ordering, it took very long for our food to arrive and though it was worth the wait the wait time between our starters n main course killed our hunger!

So, we didn't get any receipts or booking confirmation. Kind of strange. Room itself was absolutely lovely and I enjoyed the old style of the rooms. Definitely felt luxurious. I only stayed for one night but could have easily stayed longer. The rooms were clean and well serviced, with pleasant and helpful staff. The bed was comfortable and had 4 pillows in a variety of thicknesses. The over sized shower towels and non slip bath mat were a pleasant suprise, and the fusion garden was a lovely spot to have my morning coffee and prepare for the day ahead. If you just need a room for the night then it‚Äôs acceptable. The room I had was executive. It had a queen bed, a lounge to sit on and a single bed. The furnishing is old and marked. The bed was comfortable and for the price of $127 it was fine for the night. Unfortunately my experience here was horrible. The room stunk something chronic. The room and blinds were covered in dead bugs. Walls were marked and stained with liquid. Bed was not made and the sheets dirty. Carpet in front of kitchen had underlay cut out where there must have been  a flood but carpet pulled back over the concrete. Mould and dirt through the room. Bugs everywhere. Walls cracked so bad we were worried the roof was going to collapse. And for good measure we were told we were upgraded to this room and its a room they don't normally hire out to anyone. I can see why its not advertised. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE FOR YOUR OWN HEALTH!! Sadly, we didn't have the best experience. My husband and I booked for a couple of nights stay in a queen bed suit. When we arrived, we were told we had not booked a room and had to pay a $100 security deposit (nowhere on the website, did it say you needed to pay a security deposit and we are still waiting on the deposit refund).",

The food in the bar is just excellent and better than the 5 star hotels you find yourself in. I love this place for its relaxed suburban location, next to coffee shops, a tram stop, the ocean and st Kilda. Staff are friendly and helpful. We can‚Äôt wait to return. Upon visiting your establishment for a roast dinner, I had high expectations, having read favorable reviews. Initially, the bar staff were attentive, but upon the arrival of our roast, priced at $34, my anticipation waned. While the beef was satisfactory, the broccolini was served raw, the Yorkshire pudding was dense like a sponge, and the potatoes lacked the desired crispiness. As a purveyor of Sunday roasts, it's imperative that such staples are executed flawlessly. Upon expressing our dissatisfaction to the waitress, she acknowledged the shortcomings. After a brief wait, the manager approached us to inquire about our discontentment. It was expressed, in jest, that the individual responsible for the Yorkshire pudding's preparation should be dismissed. Regrettably, this lighthearted comment was misconstrued. As a British patron, I trust you can appreciate the intent behind such humor. In conclusion, I advise potential patrons seeking a quality Sunday roast to look elsewhere. This experience stands out as one of the least satisfactory in my seven years of residency here. Additionally, fostering an environment receptive to constructive feedback and displaying professionalism among staff members would greatly enhance customer satisfaction. Been here many times over the years. Always delivers great food and service. Place is well set out from the front bar, dining area or beer garden. Great for families or meeting up with mates to watch the footy. Food was really nice and the staff were very friendly and attentive. No problem there at all. It is pricey for what you get I think. $30 for a burger is steep!! It was a good burger but not outstanding. Also there was jugs of water at our table and I don't know if it's because the building is old but it tasted funky and smelled like it had been sitting in a public toilet for a really really long time.

Bathroom was filthy  sink was covered in some sort of sealant, shower was so low that I had to bend over backwards just to rinse my hair, tiles were off, or missing, silicone holding shower glass on by a thread. Service was not great, they didn't even have our booking in computer.  Definitely would not recommend. My recent stay at Sandown Regency Motor Inn Hotel was nothing short of a nightmare. Upon entering the room, I was greeted by a nauseating odor that seemed to emanate from the stained blanket on the bed. The table was littered with remnants of curry, indicating a lack of cleanliness and attention to detail by the housekeeping staff. Adding to the discomfort, the fridge in the room was broken and contained someone else‚Äôs clothes, which only added to the feeling of unhygienic conditions. Despite bringing these issues to the attention of the staff, there was little effort made to rectify the situation. It‚Äôs clear this Hotel fails to meet even the most basic standards of cleanliness and hospitality, and I would strongly advise against booking a stay here.

The food here was maaaaad, as my husband would say, oh and it truly was. We literally inhaled the starters. We didn't even take a breath. Everything was perfect and full of flavour from starters to main to dessert. This restaurant is a keeper. Big thanks to Ronny; he looked after us, and he was great. Excellent steaks and drinks. This is our second time dining here. Outstanding service and excellent steak which leave us very happy experience. Will come back again ~",

The prawn was juicy and flavourful. The same for the beef and chicken. But the portion was too small for me. I was still hungry after the session ended. Not worth it!!!! We had lunch here, food was outstanding, melt in your mouth, we had set menu, tasty and filling salmon was done to perfection and lamb/beef the most tender I've had in a long time we couldn't have eaten anymore, calamari was done to perfection. I gave 4 for the atmosphere as we were the only ones here for lunch but the service was attentive, and I didn't even have to move a plate. Was thankful we were able to enjoy our tasty food calmly without the usual food throwing surprises. We had a few games at the end, which were fun. We ate here for dinner which started at 530pm on a Sunday. The food was amazing. We chose set 4, which cost $128pp. When Entertainment Steals the Quality",

Lovely host who cooks everyone breakfast in the morning and remembers the guests names. Very disgusting hotel. I walked in to see dirty dishes at the entrance and a filthy carpet. In the room, bed sheets were dirty with a makeup stain on one of the pillows and hair through the bed. The bed was also very uncomfortable. The room smelt mouldy and musky, it gave me a headache. The shower took a very long time to warm up. And to top it off, you could hear everything in the rooms on either side of me‚Ä¶ I had to leave instantly. I received no refund. A little ordinary. Breakfast disappointing compared to last time. Guests kept coming into the dining room with nothing opened.  It seems reasonably clean. Towels old in room.

A short 5 minute walk to the train station too. We'd certainly recommend travellers stay here! Jen and Wen Staff were lovely, room was clean and comfy. Rates very reasonable. I had the deluxe spa room which was wonderful. Close to many shops and a shopping centre. Not far from the train station if your not driving. Will definitely stay again. Once again Hume Villa was a great place to stay. Wonderful staff who assisted me with information and heavy luggage. Nothing was a problem. Highly recommended. Yes, the rooms are older but we all slept well and comfortable. Room was a bit dated but super clean and had everything we needed. I appreciated the extra tea bags and milk jiggers. The customer service was excellent, Mark is very friendly and helpful. We will be back when we have another function in the area.

It was set up with a great stage and dance floor, there was lots of room so it didn‚Äôt get too crowded. There was also plenty of seating to rest your feet during the breaks. The drinks were super cheap and the staff were very professional and friendly. I am very disappointed with my stay at this hotel. Shortly after I arrived around 3:00 pm, someone knocked on my door and then opened it. I was shocked and frightened that anyone could just enter my room like that. I went to the front desk to complain, and the receptionist suggested it might have been someone checking the fire alarm. However, they should have informed the staff that the room was occupied. I was so disappointed that I asked for a refund and leave. I hope they improve their measures to ensure the security and privacy of their guests. Long hair and they don't care ,",

As seasoned enthusiasts of Japanese cuisine, we frequented this restaurant along with other top-tier Japanese establishments in years past. This restaurant was very popular and always bustling. However, during our recent visit, it was half empty. The ownership was changed. There are lots of new restaurants in the city, more competition.

I tried a large supreme pizza which was loaded full of toppings and had more than your standard amount of cheese, as well as a serve of spaghetti bolognese, pasta was average although the bolognese sauce was quite good in my opinion, though the serving size was on the small side for the price( serving size good for 1 person only, too small to split between 2 people) They are open till late( 1am) even during the week, good for those late night cravings. Not wholly authentic Italian cuisine but worth a try nonetheless... So good! Best loaded fries I‚Äôve ever had, and the pizzas were amazing!",

        "Place_Reviews": "India House Restaurant: If your looking for that authentic tandoori taste with your Indian, this is the place for you. This restaurant was a culinary marvel that I had the pleasure of dining at. The tastes of the chicken curry and butter chicken were simply unmatched, exceeding all expectations. Excellent service and a warm atmosphere enhanced the entire eating experience in addition to the delicious meal. The personnel added a personal touch to the already enjoyable atmosphere by going above and beyond to make sure that the stay was unforgettable. It is a must-visit if you're in Melbourne and in the mood for some real Indian food. It has definitely raised the bar for my eating experiences in the city, and I can't wait to go back for more of the chef's delectable creations. Seriously the worst Indian food. The butter chicken was awfully sweet! The rice was microwaved and all other dishes tasted like they‚Äôd come out of a mass produced factory process. Amazing food and service, made us feel so welcome! The fish curry was spiced to perfection! Great atmosphere and vibes. Great atmosphere and tremendous service staff. Kind and extremely accommodating, and the food was UNREAL - especially the butter chicken! Will definitely be coming back!!",

        "Place_Reviews": "Sun Wah: This place reminded us of Aja at Albert Park (which is now closed). Really great Asian fusion food. Solid but limited drinks list , very good service....and the food is fantastic!! Great pan fried dumplings, spring rolls and some of the best wagyu beef fillet asian style we have ever had....my only slight disappointment was my peking duck didnt have crispy skin....but the flavours were fantastic  and we will definitely be coming back. We went for our wedding anniversary and had the 8 courses. I have to say the service was impeccable, very attentive and friendly. The food was yummy, some courses better than others bit that's personal preference. We really enjoyed our night, everything was amazing. Thank you Gorgeous food. We had a red ballon voucher which was the Asian fusion tapas and cocktails (which were divine).  Great service, yummy food and would defo go back Overall this is a great Asian fusion restaurant. Service was fantastic, accidentally booked the incorrect night and they managed to squeeze us in during peak hour. Lovely atmosphere, although when ordering drinks the staff member kept stating he was stressed due to lack of staff but have to say the wait staff were excellent. Paid $20 each for our cocktails and they were awful, food was good, overall an enjoyable experience.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Crest on Barkly: We stayed 2 nights to celebrate my birthday. Arrived in the evening and the staff member was very helpful at finding us a room that we liked. The room was spacious and clean. Any problems we had were sorted out straight away. We felt safe, comfortable and the hotel has secure undercover parking. A staff member was very helpful when we needed to heat some food. Would definitely come back again. Close to public transport. Thank you! :) ‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Myself and my partner stayed here for one night and unfortunately we had a terrible experience. On check in we were informed that we had been upgraded to an alternative room. At 01.15am a man walked into our bedroom and gave us both an awful fright. It was a traumatic experience to find out that another gentleman had been checked into our room at this hour. The room itself was very basic and the place needs an upgrade. At 7.20 the same person whom checked us in then came knocking on our door to find out who was in the room even though he checked us into that room. We were advised he would speak to the manger about that this and see what he could. On check out he openly apologised and admitted it was his fault as he did not update the system yesterday on our arrival for the night staff. All we were offered was a cold breakfast which we kindly refused while his colleague behind the desk sniggered and laughed at the situation. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour and completely unprofessional. I would not return here and would like to reach out to the manager for a formal complaint We stayed our night in a room with queen bed and 2 single bed. When I book I simply told them what I need for my children as they have allergic reactions. Though there is no microwave we still find our stay comfortable plus we had complimentary parking. Thank you to staff‚Ä¶ I had an extremely disappointing experience, i booked to stay at their other location - Crest on Park in St Kilda. When I arrived, there was a sign directing me to this location instead for check-in‚Äîa 20-minute walk each way with luggage. This crucial detail was not advertised anywhere, which was incredibly frustrating.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Araliya Restaurant: Biggest gripe is portion sizes. We were a party of 3 and most dishes were probably enough for 2 but the person taking our order did encourage us to order an extra hopper as there were only 2. That was really nice with the duck it was served with. Tamarind fish was fresh and tasty although I personally found the sauce too peppery for my liking. We had dinner at this Sri Lankan restaurant tonight and tried the black pork curry, lamb curry, and deviled prawns with steamed white basmati rice. For dessert, we had Wattilappam, which was amazing. The food was good, and the prawns were particularly juicy. However, it didn't quite taste like authentic Sri Lankan cuisine. The twist they added to the traditional dishes works well to cater to a broader audience. The service was alright, but we found the cost to be on the expensive side, especially considering the small portion sizes. The ambiance was good too, adding to the overall dining experience. Absolutely fantastic food. Had the 8 course banquet and just about rolled out the door, everything tasted fantastic! I would eat an egg hopper every day of my life if I could. Cocktails were excellent (Bees Knees No. 2 is a winner), staff were lovely and attentive. My son wanted to write his review. Beautiful meal, fresh curry leaves, couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. Overall great value for a gourmet meal. Would recommend to any fun friend.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Sopranos on Southbank: After a long & tedious day, 2 hr drive in terrible weather, was really craving Thai, but staying directly next door to Sopranos opted to just \"get a pizza\". First some facts - all menu items have gone up between 25-33% since the same time last year. The pizzas were once great , but the quality has noticeably declined over the past year or two to just very average. Additionally, the last two times I've picked up my pizza order, the staff forgot about me, leaving my food to go cold. When I brought this to a staff member's attention, instead of apologising, they simply said they were busy. Terrible experience and food. Just awful pizza!! I don‚Äôt usually like to write negative reviews but I feel the need to warn others.  The ‚ÄúHawaiian‚Äù pizza is literally a pile of ham slices and a couple pineapple with barely any cheese. We couldn‚Äôt even eat it, it was that gross. The last time I checked, pizza is supposed to have cheese on it? I ordered a Hawaiian not ‚Äújust a pile of ham please, hold the cheese.‚Äù Lol Really disappointed with our meal - ordered 2 x pasta meals and it tasted nowhere near like a pasta would from the first bite we took. The flavour, pasta and texture was just off. Normally don‚Äôt leave reviews, however won‚Äôt be coming back here.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Tsindos: An absolute pleasure to dine here with friends on a Thursday evening. Place was packed, so recommend you make a booking. We were seated downstairs and it seemed like there was a private function going on upstairs. We chose the banquet priced at $70 per person, and we were not disappointed. We even took home two containers of leftovers! Food was delicious, from the hot, salty saganaki, to the dips, bread, olives, octopus and the amazing meat and seafood platter. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. One of the best places I have ever had in Melbourne even though next door there is a another Greek restaurant this gives a very grounded and homie vibe just looking from the entrance, and it did not disappoint at the end of the meal. I would recommend a grilled chicken and octopus best stuffed vegetables with rice. Potatoes are just amazing as well. Will come back for sure! Sensational Greek restaurant with authentic Greek food, Greek staff and a wonderful ambience. We have been a few times and recently had the banquet. Well worth $70 per head. The seafood and meat platter were heaps plus saganaki, dips, salad, octopus and yummy loukamades. Can‚Äôt wait to go back! What a  great Greek restaurant,  very very busy,  so you have to book or your maybe missed a good meal. The menu has all the traditional Greek dishes and more.  Very  generous portions and super friendly and helpful staff. Definitely coming back next time when we in Melbourne. We came here twice during our stay in Melbourne and both times were fabulous. On the first night we had the dips then the feta in a pan followed by Moussaka- great service from Georgina. The lemon potatoes were unbelievable. Last night we were late at the tennis but arrived just before 9. No problem - we shared the giros with a Greek Salad and Cypriot potatoes which were again delicious. First night we had the Greek red and last night Mythos. Both great evenings. Great place which brings back happy memories of Greece.",

Love the goat masala, and the tandoori chicken is tasty too. Ordered Kashmiri naan and add another butter garlic naan, both are highly recommended. Also ordered Kulfi, the pistachio is great and paan flavour is refreshing and very special. This is a very good place to eat at. Food is very authentic with just the right amount of heat in each dish. Service was good and timely. if you are going early in the evening probably no need to book but when we left (group of 7) the place was full, and that was on a Tuesday night and take aways where regularly heading out the door as well. if your in the area and enjoy Indian this place wont disappoint. This is mine and my family's favourite Indian restaurant in Melbourne's west. This place needs a 6th star for service. The staff here are always lovely.",

Disappointed with the inedible pizzas from this place. The bases were undercooked, and there was still stretchy raw dough under the toppings which is not pleasant. The pizza sauce, cheese and meats ALL lacked flavour probably due to cheap/bad quality toppings. Would definitely not recommend to anyone. I am leaving a review  in the hope that it saves  someone from an anaphylactic reaction. And to educate  those who handle food the importance of knowing  the ingredients. Tried Presto for the first time tonight after being disappointed with other local pizza shops. A good pizza place. Very hospitable and the price is great. Generous amount of toppings.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Piyada Thai Macleod: I booked for 15 people ten days out. We arrived and 9 of us ordered Banquet B. 1 hour and 42 minutes after we ordered, the first of the soups arrived. Not all of them. 2 hours and 22 minutes after we ordered the entrees turned up for some of us and again not for all of us. Other diners arrived, ordered, ate and left. 5 Banquet Bs turned out to be five soups and two mains with enough rice for two people. Really? Even an inexperienced waitress would question the lack of food for five people. Waitress then said we didn‚Äôt order Banquets but when we complained about the service the excuse was that they were too busy and that we ordered a lot of Banquets. Over three hours in, table after table that arrived after us were fed and left with us still waiting. Never ever going back. One job to do and that‚Äôs feed customers and they couldn‚Äôt even do that. A possible $600 - $700 table sitting turned out to be a lot less because we didn‚Äôt get food. Lots of excuses were given, no responsibility taken. Great food.Great customer service with very reasonable prices. Would definitely go again. Good ambiance and service. My original choice was closed for the public holiday so I ended up phoning Piyada Thai and I heard such a ruckus at the other end of the line I thought this place must be good as it‚Äôs clearly packed to the rafters. The best Thai food & value for money in Melbourne. You can have Aussie Thai or if you want authentic Thai (70% less sugar) but a little more spicy that‚Äôs also excellent. Fantastic service & many dishes are minimum 9 plus out of 10 üëçüëç",

They were very welcoming n their service  was top notch. The room was nice and Clean With comfy beds. Girls wanna say thank you again for your lovely service too. And Thank you to Suzanne and Mick. Hope your places will be succeful. Cheers Quaint B&B, with very attentive and helpful owners. Booked this place for my parents, was looking forward to them having a nice weekend away together. It was unfortunate hearing back that the house was unbearably cold..and the hospitality could have been a bit better. My parents remarks were \" felt like we were renting a room in a house\" they did mention the house and great location, butba little disappointing. I bought a visit as a gift to my parents, they decided to leave the B&B. The hosts would not allow them to adjust temperature on the air con unit, and the bed was squeaky and uncomfortable. In any case they had to leave and go elsewhere they didnt feel comfortable staying there. What a beautiful location, the views are unreal, and you can see the sunset over the bay from the balcony upstairs. Modern rooms, uncluttered and clean, and the owners are very friendly.

I ask for meals with no cabbage and no onion so maybe they didn't bother adding to make up for it. Really disappointing as it would be obvious to whoever put it in the containers that something is wrong, they just didn't care. Have been going to this restaurant for takeaway for years. Best Thai in the area..hadn't been for a little while ...but ordered tonight. I could not believe how small the serving was. Ordered Red Curry Chicken. Literally only 5 pieces of chicken in the serve. The serve was 30% the size of what I had always received....? Love the food here!  Love the prawn Penang curry with coconut rice. We come every Thursday. Friendly ladies. Just the music is a bit sus. üò≥ We have used this restaurant many times in the past and has been a favourite place to order a treat at the weekend . Unfortunately tonight‚Äôs meal fell way short of our expectations. The chicken dish though tasty was incredibly small. The Pad Thai was flavourless. The pork belly and broccolini was tasty. Such a shame as  we probably won‚Äôt order from here again. Tasty authentic Thai food. Great service, friendly staff. Discount with cash. Open until 10pm which is later than most restaurants in the area.",
