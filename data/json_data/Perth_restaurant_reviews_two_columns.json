        "Place_Reviews": "Adina Apartment Hotel Perth Barrack Plaza: Staff and location excellent. The apartments were good. There were a few concerns. There were 2 lifts. They made a loud clanging noise. I wondered if there was a safety issue. ? It was worrying. In the apartment some carpet was frayed in 2 places especially in entry to the bathroom. Could be a tripping hazard. The other matter was the tiles in the bathroom were very dirty/mouldy at floor level and around the bottom of the shower. Everything else was excellent. We booked a premium 2 bedroom apartment. Book a 2 bedroom apartment and it was quite spacious. Staff particularly Ivy was very friendly and helpful upon check-in. The location is good, the room was decent but the lounge is incredibly uncomfortable and on the last night that I was there the air conditioner stopped turning on.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Tradewinds Hotel and Suites: The hotel was a great location for our needs, very central and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable however we had issues with the television remote not working on several occasions and the staff reset the TV, replaced batteries but we still couldn't turn down the volume. There is only one mirror which was an issue with two females sharing the room. We booked a table for nine people for a family gathering and even though I selected an inside table, when we arrived at 7pm on a chilly evening our table had been organised to be outside. The staff were very obliging and quickly reorganised an inside table. The meal was very nice although had quite a wait for it to arrive. Fantastic hotel. Great location, delicious food, super friendly and helpful staff.  Room was spacious and very comfortable with a great kitchen area. Everything was spotlessly clean. We loved the pool, roof deck and gym area too. Thanks for a fantastic stay. We had an amazing stay at Tradewinds. The room was comfortable and clean. The staff were super friendly and helpful. We went for drinks at the bar, we had great recommendations and cocktails were made with style. Awesome location with views of the Swan River.  Who ever cooks the steaks and burgers is killing it.  It's the first time I've never had a complaint about the food lol. Dined in your restaurant during the week. With the lovely grace and subash hosting us. They went the extra mile looking after us , and recommended the rib eye steak and also paired a beautiful glass of red wine . We were  very happy with their choice for us we really enjoyed it. They were very professional and knowledgeable and made our night a right giggle . Thanks very much we will definitely be back to enjoy more of your specials. Many thanks mark.",

We stopped in after visiting the makers market that was on and were not disappointed. Food was very tasty and well presented. We ordered a few dishes to share. The view was amazing and service was very attentive. The food was good and the venue is excellent. Good value and nice place for a day out with lots of convenient parking. Only downside was that one of the staff took away the broccoli before I had finished, I wish they had asked first. I guess they were just in a rush to clear up. Great food, very relaxing atmosphere out on the patio area for lunch. Friendly staff and also nice view of the water. The roast lamb rump and grilled  broccoli were perfect! BWG Steakhouse is easily one of our go-to favourite restaurants. We love their breakfasts, we love their lunch, and we love their dinner. They have some of the best steaks in Perth, which is good news as they are a steak house. The head chef is on top of his game, and we have always been impressed with his menu. We have also attended several functions and events at BWG, in beautiful rooms with character, and a stunning view of the river. We could not recommend this place more!",

Run don‚Äôt walk to this amazing and dedicated bottomless brunch. Zac and Simon the owner where beyond exceptional being accomodating to specific drink requirements and being friendly. The most amazing people to be around for a bottomless brunch, don‚Äôt waste your time with any other bottomless brunch, this one will take care of your wants and needs as well as ensuring everyone is enjoying themselves, what more could you ask for, ended up tipping them as myself and my groups of friends where blown away by the care from the staff and the customer service, this is Perth‚Äôs best and only bottomless brunch. These people truly care about service and your happiness. Zach was awesome at our bottomless brunch! He kept our drinks filled, gave great menu tips, and made sure we had everything we needed without us even asking. His friendly vibe and great service really made our brunch special. Jack service was amazing, the bottomless brunch was to die for. But jack stole the show he was polite and helpful and really made it one to remember. Don‚Äôt waste your time on other bottomless brunches. Jack was the most amazing barman we have ever experienced.  He was so friendly and lovely, and had such a bubbly personality xxx ü•Çüç∑",

        "Place_Reviews": "Port Mill B&B: Can be noisy with Tapas bar downstairs (Friday night)  and noise carries when the airbnb room next door is let then you will hear heavy footsteps, walking and running, the bath being filled toilet flushing, etc but the location is sensational for food, bars, cafes etc., and our room was good despite the noise at times. Great place to stay, very local and handy for Fremantle's many attractions. The morning of our stay, we received a phone call to say the room had been double booked which was extremely disappointing. I was told this has never happened, but reading other reviews, it‚Äôs not the first time. The solution to this was that the owner had an Air BnB and said we could stay there for the first night and then move to a hotel down the road for the second night. When arriving at the Air BnB, we turned up to the owner‚Äôs personal house and her bedroom was ‚Äòour‚Äô room. There were personal belongings all throughout the room and it was dirty. The bathroom was a shared bathroom at the back of the house with all of the owners personal toiletries, throughout. The booking was for a private stay with our own apartment so to then be presented with this, was disgraceful. Great place for a couple to stay. Is a little tricky to find but once you are here you can enjoy Fremantle at your leisure. The breakfast is very good and we enjoyed it very much. The only criticism I have is that the fan above the end of the bed is in bad need of a clean. I would suggest to anyone booking a room that you carry an overnight bag as the stairs are a little tight for large suitcases. Otherwise everything as far as we were concerned was great. The ladies that do the cleaning and prepare the breakfast tray are very friendly and helpful nothing is a problem for them. I was so disappointed on arrival to find out that the room I had booked had been double booked even though I had booked months in advance. Instead of a room with a lovely balcony overlooking the garden courtyard I was designated the least desirable room in the hotel with a balcony looking at a brick wall. Not even sky view. The room was small with only space for a bed and 2 dining chairs at the foot of the bed so I felt quite claustrophobic without a window to look outside. The courtyard garden whilst it is lovely is not available for guests to use for sitting and relaxing as there are private residences within the complex. There is no parking available for guests. There was no opportunity for me to negotiate with the property manager. He wasn't interested and behaved as if he held no responsibility for ensuring that my stay was a pleasant one. He made no offers to investigate or find a solution to the problem. It's a shame that my experience of exploring Fremantle was not as positive as it could have been. Whilst Fremantle was great, I really didn't enjoy staying in the tiny  hotel room with a window and a balcony faciing a brick wall. I will stay home and catch the train to Fremantle next time. I will save over $500 and still enjoy the sights of Fremantle.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Adina Apartment Hotel Perth: We often stay at the Adina's in Perth. First time at Mounts Bay. Service is wonderful. Friendly and prompt. Location is great. Good access to convention centre, Elizabeth Quay and city. This was our very first time visiting Perth.   The Adina Hotel was a very good choice to stay in.  Very clean and the atmosphere, staff and service was great.   The only negative we have is that the cook top had a greasy film on top of it, and the range hood didn't sit flush like it was supposed to.   On closer inspection, there was a broken piece that had broken off onto the cook top. The lady that checked us in and checked us out 10-16 June was very lovely and definitely helped make our experience more enjoyable. The rooms are a little bit dated, the main frustration was actually using the elevators and outer doors because the key slots don't read that card properly so it takes a few attempts. The rooms are cleaned daily which was quite nice to have and the location is very convenient, not far from the action of the CBD at all, majority of the city can be reached in 15-20 minute walk. It was our first time visiting Perth, and the hotel did help provide a memorable experience. I have alsp stayed with Adina previously in Sydney and would be happy to do so again. Great location. Close to the station, shopping and food. Staff were helpful. AC was very loud in one of the bedrooms in the apartment. A great bar next to the apartments. Nice central location Absolutely disappointed.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Rendezvous Hotel Perth Scarborough: My sister and I had a wonderful stay at Rendezvous Hotel. The hotel was beautiful, rooms were clean and the buffet breakfast was AMAZING (I recommend including this to your booking 100%). The pool and spa facilities were closed for renovations, which was slightly disappointing, but understandable. Location is amazing, however, there is a very loud night club just below that did keep me up on the weekend. If you are a light sleeper, this may affect your experience on the weekends. Overall, I had an excellent stay and I will be booking with Rendezvous again for my next trip to Perth. Very dated rooms and very poorly soundproofed glazing (so you'll hear each of the many V8 engines and motorbikes pulling away from the major road junction right outside the hotel). This hotel is in such a nice area, and has so much potential if they improve a couple of things. The first would be a refurbishment of- pretty much everything. Painting on outside, carpets/bed/tv/pain in room/furniture in room as most of it was damaged or just old (bathroom was nice though) and the pool area (such a big space yet barely any shade and seating). There was no staff member by the pool and even with all the ‚Äòno climbing‚Äô and ‚Äòno diving‚Äô signs there was kids jumping from those marked areas and splashing water everywhere. Two kids fell in the short time I was there. It also doesn‚Äôt smell like chlorine at all and the water was quite dirty (especially the spa was like yellow), and a few kids were spitting into the water as well which was disappointing. Quite a unique pool though with the waterfall. Wow, what a great hotel. I Love that it has balconies. We had room 1704 2 double and my brother who was celebrating his wife‚Äôs birthday was 1804 King with ocean view, park and pool. A bit run down, needs a good revamp.

We were the last session, and it was as if they had given up. Not replenishing items, no service.

But was a bit disappointed with dinner does look lovely on the pictures, in reality  the selection was much less than in the pictures. Breakfast on the other hand was great, bacon, eggs, fresh fruit, juices cereal and much more. EDITED. This is an old review. I need to revisit now that it is been rebranded into European Restaurant. We dined here as part of the Miss Maud Hotel room package deal. Buffet dinner was superb. Staff were friendly and worked quickly and efficiently. The selections of food from seafood, salads, hot dishes and desserts were delicious. In particular the beef brisket which was melt in your mouth and deserved 5 stars of its own  - and I'm not a huge fan of beef! All the desserts were so yum, many are sold in Miss Maud cafes. Our only \"gripe\": the chocolate mousse is overly sweet. It was like the chef sneezed while adding the sugar and accidentally put in 200% sugar. The birthday balloons were a lovely surprise as was the musician who came to our table with a slice of chocolate \"birthday\" cake aka Queen Silvia. Breakfast was a laid back relaxing affair with equally efficient and friendly staff. The crepes are very addictive and so mouth watering. Everything else was standard breakfast buffet fare all well cooked and nicely presented.  Of note: the two male staff members who manned the restaurant reception at dinner and breakfast (sorry don't know their names) were so lovely and welcoming. They are a great choice to be the \"face\" of the restaurant. Would definitely recommend dining here. Firstly: any individual over the age of 10 yrs that uses the word \"yummy\" in a written review, deserves to be drowned in a warm bucket of milk! WOW...!!

First off, let's talk food. They've got all the classics you're craving, from sizzling fajitas to cheesy enchiladas and killer tacos. And don't even get me started on their carne asada‚Äîit's grilled to perfection and basically melts in your mouth. Oh, and did I mention their margaritas? Trust me, you'll want to try one (or three).The vibe at Pancho's is cozy and welcoming, with colorful decor that screams ¬°Viva M√©xico! It's the kind of place where you can kick back with friends or bring the whole fam for a fiesta.And the service? A+. The staff here is super friendly and always down to chat about their favorite dishes or mix up a custom salsa just for you.So, next time you're in the mood for some Mexican goodness, do yourself a favor and hit up Pancho's Mexican Villa.

There are three bays at the front, a car park at the rear and another beach side car park just over the road Food was good. Enjoyed the steak sandwhich special, great sized meal. The venue could do with a revamp and at the very least, an aircon unit placed inside as it was too hot / stuffy to enjoy anything. The doors to the outside area should be closed as there were flies buzzing around inside and landing on food. Opportunity for the venue to be great, given the view, but it‚Äôs definitely not there yet. First time as locals and we were there for Parmy night. What a great experience.

Lovely location, the rooms are well equipped, very clean and lots of little personal touches making it a lovely stay. Beautiful cheese platter waiting for us in our room, well worth paying for. We enjoyed our 3- night stay at Rosebridge very much. The gardens are beautiful and provide a tranquil setting. It was great to see the wildlife - parrots, kookaburra and quendas. Breakfast was delicious and cooked to order. We had a wonderful stay at Rosebridge House.  Pete & Julia were most welcoming & happy to help.  The breakfast was delicious and our stay was highlighted with the Julia's feeding of the tame bandicoots .  The bed was excellent & the decor was lovely.  Such a beautiful garden as well.

Staff were friendly and looked after us without any hesitation. Will definitely be back. I was not a guest at the hotel but a bar patron. Antony, the bartender, did an excellent job taking care of a massive group of people and being kind and professional the whole time. There was a long line to order and he managed it calmly and treated everyone really well and respectfully even though he was in a stressful situation. Also, the food was really good. The steaks and pizzas are fantastic! Such a great spot for our weekly quiz night with DuxNuts! The food options are spectacular and often changing, same with the wine and beer selection! Always a great place to visit and grab a cold beer, whilst watching the ocean.   Make sure you pick your time,  as it can get very busy-especially on weekends.   Great service,  friendly atmosphere & most importantly cold beer on tap.  The pub food looks tasty enough from a distance but by far the best part is location. We celebrated our annual People Services Award in this beautiful setting with delicious food and excellent service. The staff were very attentive, professional and friendly. Thank you to Antony especially for looking after our table. Will definitely recommend CBH for any event or celebration!",

Easy self check in and the host is easily contactable by mobile if needed. Breakfast was lovely and served at 8am. It's a good place to stay if you want to be close to the port. The little house was charming and very well done and maintained. The bathroom in the Jocelyn suite was probably my favourite due to the styling and fixtures. Everything in the room was thoughtfully done including the tea service and fridge. Thank you Susanne for a lovely stay and the continental breakfast was really good. The location is also perfect as its right near everything. Beautiful place, would recommend the top floor room, nice bathrooms. Excellent breakfast and overall service. I appreciated the easy check-in, beautiful heritage building, proximity to restaurants and the train station, overall comfort of my one week stay and Susanne‚Äôs warmth and helpfulness.  Highly recommend Fremantle B&B. Excellent place to stay which is close to everything. The Manager, Susanne communicated with us when we booked, and before we arrived,  with check in details. Breakfast was fantastic with many dietary needs catered for. The Down Under room, where we stayed had a kitchenette with microwave, kettle and refrigerator. Beds have good quality linen and are comfortable. High standard of cleanliness and tastefully furnished. An IGA supermarket is walking distance from the B & B. Beautiful historic buildings line the surrounding streets.  One evening we ate at Cage Roads Brewery, on the Fremantle waterfront; at sunset, which was very good. The train station is walking distance, and is on the direct line to Perth Station. Thoroughly recommend staying at Fremantle B & B.",

Very basic but that's all we needed for one night. Room had a strong stale/stagnant smell. Luckily we didn't need the sofa bed but we opened it just in case one of the kids wanted more space. The sheets hadn't been changed on it and were disgusting. Thank God we didn't need the extra beds as it was late and would have been a hassle to sort out. Really convenient and well priced accommodation in a no-aircon at home emergency!  Room was clean and comfortable, parking was directly outside the room, it was quiet and well maintained property.  Service was great.  My only gripe was an excessive $500 bond that seems to be taking awhile to be refunded. Stayed in Feb 2024. Absolutely loved our stay here. The area was nice, rooms were perfect for what we needed (comfy bed, tv, sitting area, microwave, coffee/tea/kettle, ensuite) and it had a pool and a playground. The staff were great to deal with and were so efficient when I emailed them to ask them if I could book an adjoining room for one of the nights.

Don‚Äôt double think just book Astoria was plesant, and I stayed there Saturday to Tursday so that last negative review was certainly unwarranted. Clearly says no alcohol in rooms so suspect they were on the bottle. Bed was comfy, security tight and digital, continental brekkie every morning,  kitchen is a shared and ample space for what you pay, clean towels daily, and close to Kingsway sports complex and drive to shopping spots which we targeted. Natalie and Michael were responsive always. I shall surely return. Natalie & Michael made the check in process very easy, the bedrooms and en suites are immaculate and beautifully presented. I particularly liked the security arrangements being in my late seventies and coming back late in the evening. Everything you need is at hand and the delightful Natalie is always at hand to help if needed. We will definitely stay again. Avoid this place. The owners are very rude and very unhelpful. Shouting and arguing with you when your trying to follow their instructions to enter the property. It is literally an ensuite bedroom with a very small bathroom. Breakfast is a lunchbox with cereal and bread which you have to make in the very small kitchen where you can't find anything. Steer clear. I booked a room for a week here (breakfast excluded) which ended up at $80 a night ($560 for the week) I ended up leaving after 3 days. For 2 nights the wifi was not working on my side of the accommodation area, I had to keep buying credit on my phone and using hot spot which ended up being more expensive. I contacted the host and she informed me the internet inside was working fine and they are doing NBN maintenance, I usually stream movies/tv shows on my laptop so after a while I got bored and asked if I could have a refund and check out early, I was not issued a refund and ended up checking out early, if a place advertises ‚Äúfree wifi‚Äù and it is not working I believe you should get a refund if you leave because the service being payed for is not being received, will definitely not stay again, the room was okay and clean, it was a private entrance but yeah I‚Äôd rather go to a hotel for that amount of money.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Fraser's Restaurant: I dined at Frazer Restaurant in King's Park and had an excellent experience. The steak was cooked to perfection, full of flavor and incredibly tender. The cheesecake was very tasty, a delightful end to the meal. I was impressed by the extensive selection of wines, catering to all tastes. The atmosphere was wonderful, making it a perfect spot for a relaxing evening. Totally recommend this place! Amazing! We‚Äôve nearly come here several times and been put off by some of the reviews. Sorry we haven‚Äôt come. Some years ago I used to come regularly for corporate lunches and dinners. So glad we came. Loved the service. Loved the food (ordered too much due to those who said the servings were small - they‚Äôre not!) Loved the view and the ambience out on the terrace for a leisurely lunch. Will definitely be back. Very good value taking into account the upmarket experience! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Fraser's on Saturday to celebrate my husband's birthday. The portions were well sized and the main came out piping hot - just how we like it. My husband said it was an excellent steak, and the dessert that came with icecream and a birthday sparkler was a lovely surprise. Nice ambient lighting and attentive service. We will be back! We went for dinner for my partner‚Äôs birthday, and it was amazing. The place is beautiful with stunning views and great atmosphere. The food was incredible. I had the best risotto ever! And the vanilla cheesecake? Absolutely delicious. Highly recommend! After visiting Lightscape it seemed like a great time to revisit Fraser‚Äôs after quite a long hiatus.  So glad we did.  Honestly one of the best meals and accompanying service we‚Äôve had in Perth. And the wine list - simply amazing.",

Christina was such a gracious hostess with her and Anthony's restaurant with many wonderful cuisines on offer being Singaporean. The atmosphere was beautiful, the food was delicious and the service was impeccable. Thank you again for having us. We will definitely be back! Really amazing food, staff members are really kind and welcoming. This is a great place to eat! What a hidden gem! A restaurant located in the Great Southern Hotel at Northbridge at William St.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is clean, quiet and cosy. The customer service is awesome as all staff are very friendly. We ordered the Singapore style fried Kuay Teow and Japanese Teriyaki Salmon Bento set. The salmon is of very high sashimi quality, cooked to the perfect taste and value for money. The fried Kuay Teow is average as it could have been more smoky and savoury. Will definitely be back to try on other foods.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Sorrento Beach Bed and Breakfast: I wish I could give this place 6 stars. The rooms are on the 2nd floor of the property. It is clean, tidy and has huge bath room + bath tube. Welcoming hostess, lovely rooms. Spa bath was the best, allowing for a relaxing atmosphere. Bed was comfortable for me and mine. Our hostess made a  breakfast that considered gluten- and dairy free needs and was plentiful, beyond standard fare and expectations. Home is well-kept and situated close to the ocean. Thank you for helping us feel welcomed. Sorrento B&B is a private upstairs area with a substantial living space and balcony access. The king room is suitable for couples and has the option for an additional twin room for families. The bedrooms are extremely comfortable and are nice and cool.  The amazing breakfast options are served in a downstairs leafy courtyard. Suitable for short or long stay, the hosts will make your stay a memorable one. This B&B stay was a present for my wife and I had read all the reviews being very positive but the moment we came to this place we felt like unwanted guests the introduction was extremely brief and dismissive. This rudeness extended to our surprise the next morning at breakfast where we received minimal food and service this was especially disappointing given the menu and pictures on the websites and we didn't get offered beforehand what we would like for breakfast as there was suppose to be quite a few options. It felt like anything she had to do for us was a huge effort and we felt really upset and unwanted. We are not competitors we are legitimate customers who have been to quite a few B&Bs and usually love the experience and we always give credit where credit is due. The rooms are very clean and the bed was comfortable however you don't want to risk your hard earned money on staying at this place.",

Good value for money, serves were large and full table service. Had a good time here. Great venue. Super chilled. Waitresses and staff all very friendly and polite. The chefs salmon special was an absolute treat. Walk in service available without a booking , but I do recommend booking if you want a window table. Amazing food and great atmosphere I‚Äôll be definitely be back Poke bowl awesome. Burgers average. Fish n chips excellent as were Moroccan meatballs special. Manager had it together but most of the young girls working as waitresses were happy to walk past a table full of empty plates or try hard not to take an order. Please train em up to clear tables and when a customer looks at you they probably want to order something. Overall pretty good though and the view is beautiful.",

        "Place_Reviews": "The George Perth: Came here for breakfast with daughter Went to the George for a work Christmas get together. Place was open and inviting, lovely atmosphere. We did have some issues regarding the food and some miss communication regarding kitchen closing time. I ordered a ceaser salad that came later the stakes? And it was quite salty.enough so that I couldn't finish it. We had planned on getting desert but apparently the kitchen close at 8pm which we were not advised of. I think the wait staff went on break which I have no issue with but it wasn't advertised. Manager was able to organise a few chocolate fondants and icecream which was really lovely. Few issues of the online menu being different then the actual menu that they given you in the restaurant also. Okay price for value. Would still return was despite these small issues We purchased a red balloon voucher for the 3 course meal with a glass of wine. High Tea with my wife at this beautiful little gem. The food was beautifully presented and tasty. Lovely spot in Perth City for a romantic afternoon! We ordered the $50 set which included a glass of bubbles. The savory bites were delicious as were the sweets however the high tea lacked in table presentation and table service. We were not informed of the morsels served.",

It‚Äôs not fancy but it‚Äôs damn good. Well worth a visit. Great experience. Jess at the front desk was very helpful. The restaurant next door was nice. Location was good. A bit of noise at night, but that was manageable. Great place great food great service not quite 5 star but very very close, definitely a great place for lunch and dinner plenty of beautiful food to choose from, reasonably priced and family friendly.. Nice enough staff, I love the old English pub vibe of the place and it's fairly quiet even on a Saturday night. The food is pretty standard as pub food goes. Christmas lunch was amazing. Staff were very polite and bubbly (considering they were missing Christmas with their own families).",

        "Place_Reviews": "Woolworths Murray Street: Woolworths Murray street is definitely a vibe on its own. Two security guards at the front can only mean it has a high level of shop lifting incidents. It is a smaller version of a metropolitan Woolworths but has fresh fruit and veg, bakery,deli and the sushi bar was one of the best I‚Äôve seen. Plenty of self serve checkouts though so you won‚Äôt ever have to wait. Product prices are almost similar to Korea.  Especially with fruits, I can hardly feel the difference.  It's like looking at a Korean E-Mart.  The shopping bag costs about 2 AUD.  I really recommend the sushi corner right in front of the checkout counter.  Very fresh and flavourful.  The price is almost similar to Korea.  9.9 AUD.  I think I'll go often while I'm staying in Australia. Woolworths in the Murray Street Mall close to Barrack Street, has it all, even has BWS liquor Outlet right next to it so you can grab you're whole grocery basket for the next week right there in the City. Woolworths itself is abit cave like walking in but I can assure you it has everything with great service to boot. Fish, Deli, Bakery, Self-service, it has the lot. It's not over busy but I went in the morning, today and it was easy, go check it out grab some yummy bakery items or some Deli goodies, well done Woolies! Usually the staffs are friendly, but today one of the staffs was rude to me. I understood how the casher systems go slow down sometime and when my payment didn‚Äôt go through I was not angry or anything but Alicia(?) told me to wait. She said to me ‚Äòwait‚Äô again and again with gesture and asked me if I could understand English. She didn‚Äôt explain to me properly. When I checked with her, she said ‚Äòyes‚Äô when I asked her if I had to wait to remove the card even though the machine says remove. She should have explained to  me to wait until she let me use the machine. I had to wait for quite a while. How she talked to me was not professional. I don‚Äôt know why she was so pissed off at me. I wished she was more calm and friendly. Oh she was talking to someone friendly though. Maybe I was treated differently because how I look.:( I was browsing the supplement section at my local Woolworths and was shocked to find krill oil supplements on the shelves. Supporting products that contribute to the destruction of the Antarctic ecosystem is unacceptable. Woolworths should immediately remove these products from their stores. As a concerned customer, I will reconsider my shopping choices until this issue is addressed.",

Sophie and Anais, the two best subway employees in Subway in Perth, incredibly friendly, and they make Subway feel like a trip to see your lovely Grandmother who has baked fresh cookies. I would come back to this Subway every day if I could. Sophie and Anais are truly the best. The other night I went into the subway located at Claremont because I was very unsatisfied the way the hungry Jacks across the road treated me. There were a couple girls working st subway that were very kind, quick workers and very positive. I told my little son in since it was his birthday and I wanted to treat him with something nice and he was very satisfied with what he got. The girls wished him a happy birthday and made sure that he was happy, they wrote happy birthday on his sub to make sure he was happy. Excellent QUICK service with two young workers perfectly presented and lovely conversation  starters!!! Made dinner for my whole family off 6, and didn‚Äôt complain once when i asked them to change a couple things. These girls should definitely get a raise or promotion!!! never seen better service!üá¶üá∫üëçüòú Finished work late thinking I could get a sandwich on the way home. It was 7.45pm and the shop was closed. The sign and google says 8pm but the girl was rude and said we‚Äôre closed no eye contact made.

I've gotten bowls from other stores before and they always slice the tomatoes, cheese etc into smaller bits but the worker didnt cut them so it was a bit tricky to mix otherwise it was a good bowl I don‚Äôt usually get subway on a thursday night for me and my kids, but i wanted to treat the kids for some nice dinner. I came in and got greeted warmly by a young lady who had such enthusiastic mannerisms! Never seen someone work so happily. It was such a pleasure seeing the young lady enjoying her work. Thanks subway üòÅ I ordered today at 1:50pm 27/12/23. The service i received was extremely rude from the girl making the subs. I don‚Äôt have an issue with certain bread being out of stock. But to receive dirty looks and an attitude from her after something that clearly isn‚Äôt my problem is different. She seriously needs to be taught basic manners! The bread that i ended up getting was undersized and rock hard. Not joking. This subway felt like a stone. Never again :( Tuna tasted good, good amount of each salad type and the bread tasted fresh. Your employee Layla served me quickly and efficiently, providing an exceptional dining experience. Her communication knowledge and also her experience meant that I was easily served with a smile and got very yummy food. Thank you for that, I WILL be coming back.",

        "Place_Reviews": "Subway: Subway on Hay St was unbelievably bad. They had only two staff members working during a weekday lunch period, moving like snails and seemingly indifferent to the long line. The food was terrible‚Äîthe bread was stale, the meatballs were burnt yet cold in some sections, and the cookies were stale. On top of that, the prices were higher than at other Subways. Definitely pick somewhere else for food. I was surprised that the same item( footlong bacon and egg) was 30 % dearer than Melbourne city. I was comparing the Melbourne price on a public holiday $9.50- Perth price $12.50 Customer was horrible and the worker was very rude with the customers. I found this subway branch using Google maps walk mode very handy if you're nearby and after a quick snack, servive here is pretty quick, aircon and radio music. #GoogleMaps #LocalGuides classic subway atmosphere, great staff quickly making my subway for lunch. bit overpriced.",

Booked a guaranteed window seat to ensure the best views. Caught the train in so we didn‚Äôt need to worry about sampling the excellent wine menu with our delicious food. Decided to have a main each with extra roasted vegetables, then 3 different desserts to share using fresh plates.  Awesome! Could not fault anything. Some might find the main meal servings slightly on the small size but they were perfect for us. Thoroughly recommend this venue and well worth the expense for a special occasion.
