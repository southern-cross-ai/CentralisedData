Text: My partner and I spent our wedding night at this hotel on a Saturday, and it was an incredibly disappointing experience. After a long day, we finally made it to our room only to find it freezing cold. We tried to turn on the heater, but it didn't work at all throughout the night. This was quite unexpected for a new hotel.

We have stayed at other Adnia hotels before, but this one was by far the worst. There was no mini bar available in the room, and the mini bar service was closed. We informed the staff that it was our wedding night and hoped for something special, but we were met with indifference. It made us wonder if they didn't approve of gay weddings.

If we don't receive a full refund, I will be sure to share this negative experience online on every possible platform.

Loved the option to gain a $10 restaurant credit for every day that the room was not made up.   Kitchen was lacking, very spacious but no toaster,  no bowls, limited tea, coffee and milk (only enough for one day and we stayed 3).  Staff were friendly. Buffet breakfast was a lovely treat and attentive and helpful staff.   Not happy about having to pay extra $15 per day for parking.  Location was great for exploring Adelaide for the first time!  Not the best value for money that I've ever spent but I still had a lovely restful and fun holiday.

Text: I would give a 4 star if the manager/staff treated me better.
I had the option between Valet parking and self parking, I would have chosen valet had I known how TERRIBLE their car park was. So incredibly steep that I scraped my back end twice on the ramp. And the concrete walls are so narrow that I scraped my rims trying to leave. Absolutely disgusting way to treat your guests when you say "sorry but the damage on your car isn't that bad" I apologise that the scrape marks on my Mustang rims aren't significant enough for you to wave the cost of parking. Thank you for NOT explaining that the car park was incredibly steep and perhaps inform guests that if you have a low car, perhaps opt for the valet service.üëé

Order a $13.00 wine? Staff ask for $13.00. But they don't tell you of the added surcharge.

I was quoted $159.00 for a room, received an email confirmation for $159.00, but was charged $160.11. No warning. No explanation. No opportunity to avoid the surcharge by paying cash.

I get it, times are tough, but how about being honest and upfront with customers?

Emailed with a complaint, but they couldn't be bothered replying. I guess that says it all about their attitude to customers.

Text: I think this restaurant is now surviving on its long term reputation. There were many disappointments. The greatest was receiving a cr√®me br√ªl√©e for dessert when we ordered a panna cotta. We didn‚Äôt like to complain at the time as the staff seemed overly occupied and stressed. My partner‚Äôs chair wobbled the entire time and his chicken was dry. He flicked a chicken piece across the restaurant because it was so tough to cut and he was terribly embarrassed. I‚Äôm sorry to say I found the octopus special tasteless and the barramundi equally so. The lemon and dill covered salmon entree was amazing though, as was the salad side. The decor is, as it always was,  lovely. Overall though, we expected more for the price and long term reputation.

I imagine there are few poor reviews for the restaurant because they encourage you to email the manager rather than write a review if you didn‚Äôt enjoy your experience. We did try to email but received no reply. We won‚Äôt be coming back unless we hear things have improved.

I love my pesto pasta but there was barely any sauce or basically any ingredients at all in it. Super disapointed. The soap dispenser was broken. Would barely or not push at all and there was soap inside, just wouldn't come out. When I was in the toilet, I heard some men came into the bathroom, "claiming" that there was no soap in their toilets. Not an excuse for them. And the bread roll was dry as.

Text: There were some good points, notably the friendly and excellent staff at breakfast who were awesome despite it being very busy. The hotel facilities are okay for the price, if a bit dated, and staying at this hotel when it is less busy could be okay. However, we stayed over Easter weekend and the hotel was rammed with large and noisy groups who treated the hotel like it was their own home (or worse). It was very loud pretty much all the time from 7am in the morning until 11pm - by far the loudest hotel I've ever stayed in. The hotel staff seemed unable, unwilling and uninterested in doing anything about it. The hotel might respond by saying that this was the fault of the groups and not their own, but ultimately the hotel holds the responsibility for making sure that ALL guests can enjoy quiet occupancy of their rooms, and we did not get that at all. Also, we paid $10 per day for a reserved parking spot, but this was a total farce since guests just parked wherever they want. To the hotel's credit, they did reimburse me for parking when I told them I could only park in my assigned spot for one night out of four. All in all, an awful experience.

Unfortunately I had to ask them to swap the mug as it was dirty and lined with cappuccino foam on the inside from a previous customer ‚Ä¶Yuk. I ordered a Margherita Pizza which arrived to my table hot. Had to ask for cutlery and a serviette. The pizza came on a plate and not in a box so I don‚Äôt understand why I would not get cutlery and at least a serviette. Very very bland tasting pizza. No herbs on the pizza and only 3 spinach leaves and tomato paste base was so bland.
Poured the tea into my mug to find the amount in the teapot didn‚Äôt even fill my mug up to 2/3.
I have eaten at The Esplanade Hotel many times before and felt I had to write a review as this place has been going downhill over the last 12 months with regard to the quality of food. The staff are very friendly but unfortunately this place is going backwards and not worth the money spent on a meal.

There could be  more exploration   play equipment there to keep children active and entertained for a longer time.
I loved my chicken schnitzel and gravy, served with chips and a side salad. Others liked the beef schnitzel and the  kids pizza on offer. The calamari dish was enjoyable, but the steak not apparently. It's quite a pricey menu, so be aware of that and nearby parking can be an issue.

Gaming and bistro has been renovated and look great! Ate twice, and both times the food was on point. Anthony on check in went above and beyond. Only let down was Slow service in the bistro/gaming room downstairs but maybe an off night?

Great to see all week lunch special for $11.90 with extras between 11am-4pm.
13/7/24 - Got Penne Alla Panna (lunch special) without ham, iced Nutella (drink) and Beef ravioli (chef special).
It was really nice! Would come again.
Sadly my Penne Alla Panna was the only worth-it-item for vegetarian if you remove the ham.

However I am concerned about the cleanliness of the room. As described in the exhaust fan photo & the photo of the dirt stains on the towel that I simple used to soak up some water on the bathroom floor. Also there was a cockroach in the bathroom during the night. Beyond that it's a busy loud area outside out room in the early evening. We are supposed to stay a second night but it's almost midnight & there are still children running around in the room above us. The soundproofing is worse than terrible. The noise upstairs is echoing around our room & the vibration creates bass that makes me feel like I'm staying in a bongo drum. Definitely wouldn't stay here again.

Flavours across all the dishes weren‚Äôt satisfying.

The worst part of all was a sign taped to the counter that we only saw after entering the store to pick up our take away mentioning a price increase. Being this was our first time coming here we picked up a menu to take home assuming it had the latest prices in there, but we were unfortunately mistaken. They charged a further $10 on top of what we expected from the menu without any FYI, explanation, etc. Understanding that costs are difficult to manage currently, but I think it‚Äôs important to be upfront with customers when taking their orders, not silently charging them afterwards.

The facility itself is beautiful, perfectly fit for our little wedding and following reception, we were proud to make those memories here.

Although, we wish we were told how small our "complimentary" room would be and that larger ones were available. We wouldn't have been able to effectively get myself, 3 bridesmaids and 2 flower girls ready in the Premier Spa Suite we had. Thankfully my parents booked a larger room and we could use that one.

Some rooms had pretty views, like the larger one our parents had. However, our view for our pre-wedding stay from a balcony room was a tin roof, filled with AC units, with two lighters and a sock on it, with a little view of the parks if you leaned out a bit.

All was perfect, except for the room issue, but maybe that was our oversight. I'd still stay here again, and very glad we begun our adventure as a married couple here!

They claimed to have a king sized bed, rather we were provided with two single beds attached together and moreover the beds were extremely hard to sleep on. The springs in each of the beds were literally poking us that our spines got hurt badly. Inside the room, the AC and the fridge were making so much noise continuously which was very disturbing. Our stay was awful. Since we had to drive to Adelaide and had to drive around a lot, lack of sleep took a toll on us.  They also claimed that complimentary breakfast supplies with cereal would be given‚Ä¶ but no that was also not provided to us.
Overall our experience was HORRIBLE and you would want to go there only if you wish to waste your hard earned money.

Text: It's a special location with a great view over the river.  We took friends there on Friday to celebrate a belated decade birthday.  The place feels special and we were given the best table by the window.  But the food is not as good as we have experienced previously.  We all ordered from the large section, but I wouldn't call them large by any means.  My husband and I had the barramundi... it was well presented but very small took up about a third or less of the plate and was not particularly outstanding in flavours either.  Our two guests  - one had the steak which just looked like steak with rocket and capers on top no other veg or colour and the other had the Lamb from the chef's special which looked better but she said it was a bit chewy.  We are glad we ordered two sides to share.  Then for desserts, there are only 3 choices of dessert plus affogato & coffee and none of them were really special, I could make any of them at home.  I would expect at least 6 choices of desserts and them to be something very different.  They too were very small, nice but not amazing.  We both felt embarrassed as this was supposed to be a special birthday gift for our friends which still cost us a lot but wasn't amazing food.  The service was great and all the waitresses were great.  But the food needs a pick up in size and taste. I we can see an improvement in the menu and food so we might come again sometime.... but for now I don't recommend the food.

After I had told her she did offer to get me something else but i just said no thanks.The little piece of carrot even my daughter in law commented it actually looked dehydrated.  The few little pieces of potatoes were not crispy but pale and looked like they had been cooked this morning and held heating for lunch. The couple of small pieces of pumpkin was beautiful.  Some greenery would have looked nice on the plate. All in all it was the smallest and worst roast I have ever had anywhere.

Text: My recent visit to Subway was highly disappointing. Despite the absence of customers inside, the tables were noticeably dirty.

I decided to order a chicken sub, but it was nearly inedible. The taste was off, suggesting that some of the veggies were either rotting or past their prime.

Consequently, I had to discard the sub after only a few bites. Overall, this experience was far below expectations, and I cannot recommend this Subway location based on the poor cleanliness and food quality.

Just a suggestion from a customer if it's a busy time, please don't keep a newbie if they don't know how to make a sub and  slow's down the line. if you are keeping a newbie,  please teach them how to make a sub. That would be great. The sub was bad.
Felt like I wasted my money

We were quickly seated, enjoying our drinks while checking the share plates menu [I won't say Tapas since in our many years racing and travelling in Spain  we enjoy Tapas in it's historic context as a gift when buying a drink]

We ordered three small plates - all were delicious!

Service was great, and, with 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine so was the $83 price

The pizza being served to nearby tables were generously topped when out of the oven with tasty, fresh accompaniments - we'll try one next time!

The hot crusty Cobb loaf of bread is a must. I found it odd that what I ordered from the menu was changed by chef and I received different items to what I thought I ordered. I did tell our waiter and  then quickly received what was originally on menu. Our tables were never cleared after we finished eating which was annoying as we were there for a few hours. Staff seemed very young and inexperienced. Has potential but needs help. Hope they get it right soon.

There's usually a 20%-ish chance that the drinks machine will not be working, and frankly the post-mix is half the reason I get lunch here. I've been burnt too many times to get to the till only to find it's not working, and honestly an "out of order" sign would go a long way to curbing my disappointment except one is never erected.

Despite this, I will say that the staff are lovely; many know my regular order and they all do their best during busy periods.

Other than that I have had one more experience saying that we are out of material such as bread and veggies so we can't take you order in. I mean Subway being such a great brand, I don't understand how is this quality gonna make them save their brand values. No customer service, no materials. It has been a very bad experience and if there would have been an option of a zero star, I would have opted for it.

This is where you can immerse yourself in authentic Japanese teppanyaki in the heart of Adelaide. Headed by Shiki Chef de Cuisine, Kenny Trinh, where the team have created a delicious menu of truly succulent sushi, sashimi‚Ä¶ and the list goes on and on. They are without a doubt, the ‚Äòbest of the best‚Äô, and proud to showcase South Australian produce. The menu is extensive like the wine list, however I strongly suggest you try the sushi and sashimi selection, prawn tempura, wagyu beef, bok choy and snow peas, vegetable fried rice and miso soup, and for dessert the mango mousse with coconut jelly. All complimented with the traditional Japanese wine, sake. What more can I say - everything was tasty, juicy and cooked to perfection.

Toilets were clean and had 1 disabled toilet with bars, not sure if you would fit a large wheelchair in there though. There are ramps to all the different sections and space between the tables to get around.  They have done a great job refurbishing the place.

Text: Went in for a footlong sub, when the girl was cutting the bread she cut herself. Whilst wearing gloves, it was evident she had hurt herself and went to wash her hands and dabbed paper towel on her hand repeatedly. She replaced the glove. I asked if she got blood on the sub and she replied no and gave a horrible look. Her work colleague, a skinnier girl with yellow teeth came out from the back and started serving the lady behind. The skinny girl was rude and slammed shut the oven door, and banged the tubs around when they were empty and also was rude in her customer service. The other girl, Amber also got my order wrong when i said Pizza sub and began making it a BLT. Fillings were skimpy and not placed with any care or interest. No customer services skills either, it seemed myself and other customers were more of a burden then welcome to enter the store and place an order. Hope management sees this review and provides appropriate training to the two staff.

Text: The worst customer service I have ever seen in a fuel station. EFTPOS machine not working and the staff is forcing me to take money from the Redi ATM by paying $2.90 extra incurring additional cost to the customer. I was ready to let them take copy of my ID and vehicle details,  so that I can come back and pay using card as I live very near. And it was not at all acceptable for the staff. Was talking in such a way that I'm at fault like a criminal.
Staff is not ready to give the manager conct number. Is this the way to operate?

OTR customer service number in out of service hrs.  I'm now at the fuel station.....I have left feedback to OTR also about this incident. The way staff talks is very rude......!
Should have informed the customer before filling fuel that EFTPOS machine is not working.

Here in this situation customer can give his ID to copy and let the staff know a time when he can come back and pay the amount.  Here the staff was saying,  take money from Redi ATM by paying $2.90 extra or I will call cops!.... is this right? I was happy to call the cops myself.. but there was another program for which I was on the way and already late...I don't mind paying extra and getting cash... but this is not the way a staff should talk to a customer,  in a very rude way. Even maccas puts up a sign when eftpos is down!...

Text: I wouldn‚Äôt have given any stars but for the sake of being able to write a review I have given one star for the most poorest customer service I‚Äôve encountered! Went here on Tuesday 20/7 during the day before lockdown commenced at 6pm and was refused service as we didn‚Äôt have a mask on. A member of our family was with us whom is under the age of 12 therefore no mask required and he was going to go in and pay but was also refused! He was also referred to as a ‚Äúshe‚Äù twice! Staff said we needed to purchase a $20 mask üò∑ in order to being served. Other customers were at the service station at same time as us and were also told ‚Äúno mask no service‚Äù and were told they had them there to purchase at $20 each.
We were completely gob smacked! Surely this kind of customer service is criminal.

Petrol prices to we find here are the most expensive at any particular time in comparison to all other service station brands across Western suburbs.Trust me we live down here. This place is good for only a couple of things, coffee,hot & cold, tea, grabbing a quick bite, pies,pasties,cakes, Krispy cream dohnuts & smokes for those of you smokers too scared to visit or who haven't yet woken up to vastly cheaper tobacco shops around suburban Adelaide who carry much less expensive DF "old school" ciggys without the "fire retardant chems" that put them out,produce foul taste, & price to send one bankrupt!

When substitutions need to be made for online orders they always write a note and if it's close to closing usually an extra cookie or 2. The customer service is amazing especially the closing team on Sunday 24/3. Thank you so much for all your hard work, it doesn't go unnoticed.

Warm Chicken Salad was amazing and the chicken was so tender and flavoursome. The cheese dish was lovely and the Bread and Chicken Platter was so delicious as well.

Espresso Martini was lovely as well and had a nice strength to it.

Very impressed and would go back again.

Text: Among wi the times I've been to that store along with ordering through deliver services the food has always been incorrect or unsatisfactory. First off that store never accepts the order from deliver service, and when on the rare occasion they do accept the order is wrong.

One time my partners and I order from there and they got the salads mixed up and the complete wrong meats. It is shocking how bad that little subway is, almost never has  any meats nor salads, along with the cucumber being soft and onions gave off a weird smell . The times I've order my salads were clearly not fresh as the lettuce drooped out the sides. The Subway is a joke and I would honestly never recommend this store to anyone.

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!

Quality of the food along with the attitude of some staff members has gone completely downhill. Late shift staff are often rude and completely over it, however, this is not my experience with small franchise stores where staff are lovely.
Complaint to Subway Australia and OTR went unanswered.

Avoid, unless starving.

Text: Was double charged ($46) for fuel a few months ago at this place. Showed proof of the double charge moments after it happened. The cashier was unable to refund me and blamed my card (which had never been an issue prior and still hasn't). I left after spending half an hour there trying to get the refund but failing due to issues with the refund process. I escalated the incident online to get a direct bank transfer refund. Was a week before someone got back to me, I had multiple phone calls and emails with customer support after this. Was always told that it would get escalated and sorted and was regularly passed on to someone else. Last I heard my claim was being sent to the IT department who would contact and refund me (told this at the end of March). Still haven't been contacted nor have I received my money back months later. Just seems they want me to forget about it. Poor service and essentially robbery from this business. Always liked and used OTR regularly before this.

No one was rude or malicious but at the end of the day I'm out almost $50 and wasted more time than it's been worth trying to get my money back.
