Text: The staff were lovely, but unfortunately that’s where the quality of this resort ended. There was a dead lizard in our shower covered in ants, toilet wouldn’t flush properly, kettle didn’t work, barely any drinks on the pool menu were available & we heard somebody at 3am trying to break in through our sliding door. The loud & dirty rooms were certainly not worth the price.

Hotel staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel had 2 large outdoor pools , one underneath shade cloth that was cooler water temperature. Hotel has parking that you need to pay for, walking distance to town center. Breakfast is provided with an extra charge is was a buffet style of Continental or hot cooked breakfast

Text: We stayed here for two nights, it was pleasant to see all the Indigenous art in the foyer, which had a strong perfume smell, and carried through to the hallways leading to the rooms. When we got into the room, it was very small for the price and the room had a thick smell of mould, but we expected it for the wet season humidity. The staff were very happy to serve us, and we told them about it after our stay. Loved loved loved the Waterfront to death and would come again.

Text: Location is the best in Darwin . Hotel is surrounded by restaurants and the wave pool plus the water terrain park. Great for families . Room service was very disappointing. Be careful . Ordered the club sandwich and you can see by pictures it’s a club sandwich at a “different level.”  On checkout showed pictures of the “special club sandwich “ to reception staff….couldn’t give a rats…$22 dollars plus a $4 tray service . Maybe an off day in the kitchen but….really ? You serve this as a club sandwich ?

Text: The waterfront rooms are very noisy, with music from downstairs cafes and festivals. Worst if all was the water aerobic instructor in the wave pool, yelling (although she was mic'd up) to her class at 8am Sunday morning. Beyond hotel control, I guess, but awful.
Decor in the rooms is at least 15 years old and very basic.
Be warned, showers are over the bath and very difficult to enter and exit.
A very average hotel. No quiet lounge or cocktail bar. No escape from kids.

Text: We booked this hotel months ago and paid the extra price (over $400 per night) for a room with a view. The description of these premium rooms state “ water view” and the room images support this. Arriving in the dark, it wasn’t until this morning ,that we opened the curtains to a view of the  roof of the restaurant below us and trees. When I checked with reception to see if there had been a mistake in our room type  I was told “ technically it does have a view - of a park and if you stand in the corner you can see some water”
First impressions count the most so it now doesn’t matter how lovely the staff are or how clean the room , we are really disappointed and won’t be staying here on future visits or recommending this hotel to anyone.

Plenty of eating and drinking options on the covered esplanade below make it easy to enjoy relaxing there. Water sports are also well catered for with a wave pool and water park literally right at the back door. An easy 10 minute walk from the CBD.

Before Tonight we had tried 2 of the best known South East Asian Restaurants in Darwin, one was Vietnamese Chinese Malay fusion restaurant and the other one was Srilankan Thai. So tonight we tried Hanuman as the Thai Indian Restaurant  and this time we were not disappointed, in fact the food was very good, the chicken Briani was very tasty with a bit of spiciness  The service was excellent, especially the waitress named Nita from Indonesia was exceptional, she was very friendly, always smiling and her recommendations were all very good. A pity that we have limited small asian stomach capacity, so that we just ordered 2 appetisers and chicken Briani as main course. All 3 dishes were very good and tasty. When in Darwin the Hanuman is very recommended not to be missed. Last but not least the price was reasonable.

Text: We had a very comfortable stay here in May in the apartments. The rooms and beds are good with regular room service, and it's right next to a beautiful bushwalk and beach. The staff are helpful and friendly.  The pool is pretty chlorinated but made for a great swim and the grounds are nicely maintained.

My only real beef was that they do not have recycling bins anywhere which is a real shame.. also, a bit more kitchen equipment (strainer and more cutlery and crockery) would be a great addition.

Text: We recently stayed here and found the resort to be clean and well maintained. The reception staff were friendly and helpful.

The bathroom layout is quite awkward- you wouldn’t want be a large / heavy set person using the toilets here as it is located facing the shower and is not a comfortable space to place yourself in.

We ate at the restaurant one night out of our 3 night stay- service began well, the waitress was attentive and friendly making sure all tables were serviced and plates cleared, menus offered etc. For some reason the staff swapped or changed roles and the new waitress who took over service of the outside tables was slow and left plates on tables even through we had finished our meals and ordered desert and coffee. Our deserts came out at different times - roughly 8-10 minutes apart, then the coffee came out once the last desert was eaten. It wasn’t until the coffee was brought out the main meal plates were cleared but the desert plates left on the table ! I’ve never encountered service like this before. When we went to pay the bill, the original waitress was behind the bar and till with no idea just how bad our service had been.

There is a well equipped guest laundry - but it is some distance from the reception and the vending machine for washing powder is out of order, so it’s quite a walk to go get some or get change for the washers and dryers.

We only stayed here as a friend worked here several years ago whist travelling and she raved about how wonderful the resort was. The location is slightly out of the way, but you do have the stunning beach close by, the rooms could be very noisy with the guests and residents above dragging furniture around from around 5:30am most mornings and the room next door had the tv blaring until quite late. While we did enjoy our stay, I’m not sure we will be back again in the future.

They make up lies to avoid to clean your room and make up random rules to give excuses.  Rooms are extremely dirty and have ants everywhere.
Do not stay here if you have the budget to stay elsewhere.

Text: Stayed here during a quick solo trip up to Darwin.

Friendly and accommodating service during my late check-in (past midnight), and the lady on reception was kind enough to give me some suggestions for my time in Darwin.

Bed is comfortable, bath and shower great.

Only thing I could suggest is maybe having Chromecast compatible TVs, so guests can watch their own shows whilst relaxing.

It is a bit steeply priced, but easy to forget that when you're hanging out at the Lagoon pool!

Would recommend.

Text: Room we had was just OK as it's a bit dated and didn't really take full advantage of the beach views.
The blockout curtains made for a great sleep. Room housekeeping service was slow and the room wasn't serviced until well into the afternoon. The location on Mindil Beach is fabulous but it was a bit disappointing that the gate to the beach wasn't always open, even in the daytime. Food is good.
If you expect that the Mindil Beach Casino Resort would have most rooms overlooking the fabulous beach you may be surprised that this doesn't seem to be the case. If a beach view is important to you, please check availability when you book. We made the mistake of not checking but fortunately the receptionist was fantastic and found us a room with a beach view. Saved the holiday and we had a great time in Darwin.

Text: Here's another hotel living off its position. My room wasn’t 4-star or luxury: it was basic, dated and in need of a good makeover. Housekeeping was shockingly poor and unreliable: no service at all on day 2, then 3 days of no servicing until I requested it mid-afternoon (when, instead of unwinding, I had to vacate my room again). At nearly $300 per night, I expect better.

Other low points included: centralised air-conditioning; a bathroom tap that fell off; sharing my room with a gecko; common areas stained and littered all day (or longer); being charged twice for 3 more days instead of being refunded for 3 (after complaining about housekeeping failures). So much for that relaxing break...

Sure, the sea views are great – even serial underinvestment can't spoil those - but you will pay (lots) more for the privilege, and see them from a ridiculously small, cramped balcony, of which half (literally) is taken up by an abandoned planter, now roughly covered with AstroTurf - stylish!

I won't be an inmate, sorry guest, here again. Stay in central Darwin for better choices of accommodation, bars and restaurants. It's a quick, cheap Uber ride to Mindil Beach, where you can still hang out at the Infinity pool here, visit the market and watch the sunset – then return to a modern, clean, comfortable, fairly-priced room. Repeat as desired...

Gym was nice as well for a workout. Casino next door along with many restaurants providing options for the food. Spa available in the resort. Cleaning was completed daily. Little balcony with the room was a great add-on. I found the price to be quite amazing for this 5 star resort.

All appliances very old and used.
We made the most of it and it was comfortable enough... but I certainly felt a bit ripped off for the price. I'd have been better off just getting a cabin.

I have super high praise for the pool area and performers. I very much enjoyed sitting by the pool, listening to the singers - they were great! The staff were polite too.

The only reason I probably wouldn't stay again is due to the room. But otherwise, a wonderful place.

Text: We have just had our wedding at FreeSpirit Resort in July, 2024 and my now husband and I simply can’t thank the team enough or recommend the venue enough. A special mention to Jewel who supported us through the entire planning process and were there for everything along the way. She was responsive to emails, happy to have a meeting whenever and took our suggestions but somehow made them better and offered insightful advice and practical solutions to any mishap. Jewel was the backbone to our wedding and we can’t thank her enough for her help and hard work!

The set up, the vibes the EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect, exceeding our expectations and we wouldn’t have changed a thing. We had so many comments from family and friends about how friendly most of the staff were, the food, the atmosphere, the set up and the service. Some proclaiming it to be the ‘best wedding they’ve attended’.

We genuinely can’t think of the words to express how grateful we are for your time, efforts and absolute dedication to our day and making it everything we dreamed of. We had the best day of our lives and appreciate how accommodating you and the team were to us and our needs!

We would also love to extend a HUGE  thank you to the bar manager, Julie. She was wonderful and certainly went above and beyond to keep everyone hydrated and put up with our antics. The staff working in the marquee were absolutely amazing as well and we appreciate everyone’s service and ability to have a laugh with us on the day.

Honestly it was the most magical day.
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. It was amazing and we will be recommending this venue for any future functions because it was absolutely perfect.

The day after we also had a recovery session by the pool, food was great, pool was nice and the service was again fantastic (particularly by Julie)!

We had many guests stay at the resort as most were from interstate and they all enjoyed the convenience of having everything in one place!

Text: Ok, so hadn't realised this store was open again till I went to order tonight. Unsure if staff new, or a once off - but cheese garlic bread had no cheese on it, and the BBQ Meatlovers pizza had not toppings on half the Pizza. ironically three of the pieces of the Pizza had nothing but cheese on it, so apparently the cheese moved from the garlic bread to the Pizza. The Pizza also tasted strange and it took me a few minutes to work it out - there is either no BBQ sauce on the BBQ Meatlovers, or they have used the standard Pizza sauce.

In other words, they couldn't have gotten much more wrong with the order. Maybe need to give them some time to get better to try ordering again.

I have attached photos as reference - if they are not the saddest looking BBQ Meatlovers and Cheesy Garlic Bread I have ever seen....

Text: Quick takeaway pizza for dinner on arrival into Darwin for a week long business trip.
Pleasantly surprised, my expectation on takeaway pizza is not that high, however I'm happy to say that the pizza from City Pizza was well above my expectations.
Certainly not the sloppy mess you normally get from other pizza shops, this pizza was not smothered in cheese, had great toppings a d was flavorsome.
Well recommended

Text: I went there with my mother looking for a healthier option. When I entered, I saw a   subway representative inspecting the store. He had a temperature sensor and was measuring the temperature of the cold meats, and salad bar. He also checked the cleanliness of the soft drink nozzles. He did more quality and safety checks but I was too busy enjoying my subway sandwich with my mother. Seeing this, I have good confidence that subway cares about their food safety, especially by visiting a store in Darwin, which is far away from corporate office. I love that because mother is immunocompromised. My friend is a food inspector and when we went to Vietnam in 2015, he was always looking for subway as it was a safer option. Now I know why.

Text: Arrived in Darwin yesterday, I was looking for my first brunch in town
I took time to go around town to find the best option, and I'm glad I came to Ben's Bakehouse
Before entering, I already thought I had found the right place, seeing how many customers were there
And now I know why:
Friendly staff, smiling, joking around, and when you see the owner calling some customers by their first names, some actually wishing her a happy International Woman Day, her introducing some visitors to each other, etc, you understand how human connections are important here
Also there are plenty of staff, so even though the place gets very busy at times (with white collars, blue collars, other locals, plenty of them being returning customers I could tell, and tourists even - no wonder, the place has been featured in several renown publications, such as Qantas onboard magazine, and Le Guide du Routard), service is fast
They have a few spots to sit inside, and many more outside
Plants all over
Newspapers available for a read
And the last but not the least, the food indeed
Lots of food options, with savory items (sandwiches, Turkish bread, toasties, breakfast specials, quiches, pies, salads), and sweet ones (viennoiserie, cakes, fruit bowls...)
Many drink options as well, with lots of coffee ones, tea as well, milkshake, soft drinks...
I personally had a spinach feta quiche, a mixed berries, and a apple turnover to have there, and a fresh salad bowl to go (they have 5 types of salad, and you can mix them all)
Highly recommended!

They were very quick to serve us and the waiter had a great memory as he remembered 8 drinks at a time. The food was delicious. The toilets are not for disabled people, as not very wide and a step to get in. They had round tables for big groups, so you could talk to everyone. I found it a little expensive ( but isn't everything these days). We will definitely be going back again. I highly recommend the Prawn spring rolls and the sizzling Mongolian Lamb.

Text: Update: I've removed some stars because the most recent time that I visited Noodle House left me not wanting to come back ever again. We waited exactly 35mins at our table and not a single waiter/waitress took our order, they didnt even walk past us or make eye contact. We had reserved a table, and there were about 6 tables around us with people frustrated that their orders weren't being taken either. We sat at the tables outside - it appears to me that the indoor customers are highly prioritised, and the out-door folk get treated less-than. I have been noticing this practice getting worse over the years. We tried to get the attention of a waitstaff but they were just far too busy to even notice, yet they continued seating more people...only to not take their orders.
I dont understand why they continued seating people if they couldn't even look after the current customers that were waiting for over half an hour.

I stood up and returned the menu's inside after failing to get anyones attention, and walked out with my family to another restaurant down the road. The service has become so poor lately. The food is amazing, but far too overpriced; each year the food gets more and more expensive. Absolutely ridiculous for less-than average portions. Will not be returning again. This place has become an absolute joke.

Again, to reiterate, it wasnt just my table that was waiting for over 30 minutes, the tables around us had been there much longer and still had their menus in their hands waiting for someone to take their order.

Ps: these photos were taken over the course of a few years when I used to visit more frequently - back when someone actually took our order within minuites of us being seated.

Struggled to hail a waiter to take our order. Every staff makes zero eye contact or scan for service. The owner(Green Shirt Casual) was entertaining a regular on the table right NEXT to us. Faced me directly and ignores me with my hand up only to sit down with his regular to refill their water.

The Mud Crab we were quoted $120 but were told that the person taking the call made mistake and charged us $130. The served crab was pretty sad, mostly hollow shells, like the crab was sitting there weeks waiting to die.( Go the Cathy's for Mud Crab)

The Bugs tails was bitter so nothing to write about there.

Won't be going back.

Not long after, meal orders taken. Starter arrived not long after. Then Waited almost an hour for our main meals. The table dining behind us arrived after us, had their meals & left before we'd even got our meals. Went for a birthday meal & all I wanted to do was leave after waiting over 50 min for mains. We were told, by owner, it was busy & no phone orders taken in an hour. Only received apology from her, no offer of discount or drinks on the house. French male host could not look us in the eye after we got owner involved. Left without my child getting ice cream we'd paid for. Was so frustrating. I love supporting small business but we have no intention on going back.

Following the sarcastic response from the owner I’ve amended my review to 1 star. My review was based on several visits over the past few months and not when the store was closed. No wonder this venue has a 2.5 star average rating. Only a matter of time before this venue closes. Clock’s ticking

We were able to tie our dog up on the fence out the front, then move a table closer to it. We sat under a tree in the shade! It worked out perfectly.

Located at Wagait Beach, the roadside signs to the Country Club conjure pictures of a green spreading golf course, with a modern comfortable pub, with a verandah overlooking the sea. The reality is very different. The club is a humble bar in a shed with a large covered area near a mature banyan tree. The tables and chairs are very basic.
After getting over my surprise, I decided to eat here anyway and very glad I did. I ordered a meal and drink and relaxed for an hour or so. The peace and isolation was great. The barman was friendly and ready for a chat. The fish and chips were fresh and quickly served up. Real old-fashioned country service. Thanks guys.
Afterwards, I went to Wagait Beach and enjoyed a gorgeous sunset, quiet beach and cool evening. The whole experience was magical.
It's a 1 1/2 hour drive from Darwin but I'm glad I made the effort. The jetty at Mandorah is worth a stop too. You can see Darwin across the harbour.

The breakfast menu was impressively diverse, offering a wide range of choices to cater to all tastes and preferences. I opted for the continental breakfast, which allowed me to enjoy a buffet-style experience similar to customers who stay in hotel.
The combination of good food, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere made for an excellent overall experience. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy a delicious breakfast in a welcoming environment.

The Vegetables whilst fresh were bland and no or little seasoning and not Finished with butter which to me takes it up a notch.
But I'll definitely go back to try the rest if the menu.

Text: The worst experience I ever had in Darwin.
First I have to say I made a mistake: I thought bbq pork was roast pork and ordered it. I quickly realized the problem, but I thought that since I ordered it, just eat it, should pay myself’s mistake. But after I took a bite of roast pork, I found that I couldn't stand it at all. The pork was very smelly, and the vegetables next to it were even tainted with flavor.

Another little episode. When I ordered the meal, I asked if there would be mashed potatoes in this dish. Today's protagonist (the bald manager) told me that there was no mashed potatoes, but vegetables, so I ordered an extra mashed potatoes. When the food came, I found that the vegetables he mentioned before actually included potatoes🥔. Excuse me? Yes, it’s not mashed potato, but why didn't you remind me?

After I finished my first bite, I decided to talk to the manager about changing my meal to today's special meal lamb shank ($20). I paid my meal $29. The manager said that you can change, but you have to pay for the replacement meal(with contemptuous smile). Excuse me? is can be say a change? Not a new purchase?

Later in the conversation, the manager told me that I have to pay my fault even if the food not good. But let me ask you, if the food is so terrible and the service attitude is so bad, why should I pay for it? So I asked for a refund, but the manager told me that I as a customer, I have no right to refund because the food tastes bad. Excuse me? You creat the Australian Consumer Law?
luckily, I got my refund finally since I started act angry.
Last question for manager: if I not a Asian Face, will you still treat me like that?

The following reply is in response to the owner reply to me, so which I can’t reply the owner directly don’t know why:

How ridiculous. I can't believe you as the owner of this restaurant can say something like this.
First of all, when I order, I didn't point to the menu or the food and say what I want like you said. As you said, you haven't sold ribs for six months(that not the point of whole thing!!!), and I visited your restaurant nine months ago,I remember your restaurant serve pork something , so I even didn’t watch the menu, just said I wanna roast pork, I couldn’t even remember the meal name and said wrong thing, how did you make up the conversation that I asked the manager if there was BBQ pork and the manager said no???when I made order??? I realized I said wrong thing after I oder, then I just ask your stuff and knew the pork rib unavailable anymore.
As I wrote at the beginning of my review that I named the food wrong caused I didn't get what I want, it’s really doesn’t matter and I am willing to pay for my mistakes. But the premise is that this food(roast pork) is at least not so unpalatable right?

Also, I did received $29 refund(cash). Since I ordered roast pork and a extra mashed potatoes, I can show a screenshot of my bank statement to prove I paid 29. You can't even figure out the specific amount of the refund to me, and you dare to talk about the whole thing as if you witnessed the whole process with your own eyes.

Regarding what I was talked about open a restaurant, what happened was your manager told me that customers have no right to get refund coz the food tastes bad. I said that I have also opened a restaurant, and I’m very sure customers have this right.

Let me tell you one last time what the whole point of what happened today is:
1.Regardless of whether I refunded or changed my meal, it was not because I ordered the wrong meal, but because the meal I ordered was very unpalatable and difficult to swallow.
2.I am dissatisfied with your Manager's service attitude because he didn’t provide the rights that customers should enjoy.
3.Now let me add one more thing, I'm not happy with you because as a restaurant owner you are blaming customers without knowing what the whole thing is.

I first came to the fiddler's 4 years ago and never have I been in town and skipped a visit and never been disappointed. The service is incredible, there's a legend named Antonio who makes the best cocktails in town. All I need is to walk through the door and a few seconds later my favourite is ready to go.
There are great pubs in Darwin but that one is, hands down, the best. I literally couldn't recommend it enough.

Text: This is more of a suggestion regarding breakfast, specifically about Avocado on toast. The bread used seems the one you buy in the supermarket for less than 2 dollars, a thin layer of avocado and an egg. I paid 14 dollars for something I felt I could have made without effort in my house. I think just replacing the bread for a more quality one could have done. Everything else was good and I have had dinner here before and it was great, presentation and all, just this one I felt so unsatisfied.

Text: Nestled in the bustling streets, there lies a culinary treasure that might just be the city's best-kept secret – a quaint sushi place that may be modest in size but is colossal in flavor. This sushi spot is a haven for those who cherish the delicate balance of sushi rice paired with the freshest ingredients.

The California roll and  prawn tempura sushi roll I had the pleasure of tasting were nothing short of perfection. Each roll was crafted with precision, ensuring that every bite was a harmonious blend of flavors. The sushi rice was seasoned impeccably, complementing the succulence of the prawn tempura and the creamy texture of the avocado in the California roll.

Despite its compact size, the store is ingeniously designed to welcome a steady flow of sushi enthusiasts. It's a place where the focus is solely on the takeout experience, ensuring that each order is given the attention it deserves. The absence of tables and chairs speaks to the on-the-go nature of the city life, catering to customers who appreciate quality food in the comfort of their own space.

The charm of this sushi spot is not just in its food but also in its unassuming presence. It's a place you might miss if you're not looking closely, but once discovered, it becomes a regular pitstop. The only regret one might have is not ordering more – a sentiment I share deeply, wishing I had indulged in just a few more of those delightful rolls.

In conclusion, this sushi establishment is an essential destination for those in pursuit of a genuine and exquisite sushi adventure. It stands as proof that the most remarkable experiences often come in unassuming forms – exemplified here by the modest yet profoundly gratifying sushi rolls. An experience not to be missed!

The server waved at the open tables and told me to pick one.  Then she put a bottle of water in front of me and disappeared and never came back.  No menu. No service.

A large group came in and was seated and served quickly.  Maybe Icchi Izakaya doesn't like serving solo diners, but they had so few customers its hard to imagine turning away a paying client.

Who knows what the food tastes like.  After 20 minutes of waiting for a menu I left.

Even from out front it looks closed, but don’t be fooled, this larger than expected fish and chip shop is open and we were pleasantly surprised by our lunches. Although a little more expensive than we thought, both the fish and the calamari was fresh and tasty. The service was great- staff are friendly, but rushed as there were a lot of customers even though it was mid- afternoon. We would come back, the dinner box fish is large enough for 2 to share so we did that and also got a calamari box which ended up being plenty of food for the 2 of us to share.

Text: I was annoyed when on the phone it sounded like the lady told me seafood sticks were $2 but ended up being $2.50 and the serves of chips are to laugh at, see my images of what $6 worth of chips look like. I honestly have felt ripped off. But when I opened the pack and saw that beautiful piece of snapper...awesome. The fish was fresh and was battered well, hot but still crispy. The seafood sticks were good, if only a little on the soft side but had some crispy bits. The chips were above average for fish n chip stores but the amount was a super let down. If you thought $6 of chips could feed your family you’re wrong. This review would've been a 4 or 5. The chips definitely have affected my rating. If I had only bought the fish, it would be 5 stars easy.

Edit: Went back again, the second trip was much better, got more chips with my purchase, calamari rings were excellent and the battered snapper       was still awesome for the price. Possibly my new fish n chips shop. Updated review to 4 stars, thanks.

18_08_2021_Edit2: Inconsistency is disappointing, new attached image is not $30 of fish n chips on a tiny tray. Called the owner, they advised they weigh all the chips, but in no universe can you tell me there is $30 on that tray.

The lady behind the counter had her back turned from the service area while she was on her phone which I can understand, it’s a quiet night. I wasn’t expecting 5-star service but a hello would be nice when she finally noticed me and took my order. As I was watching her make my order, she had not washed her hands prior and almost forgot to put gloves on (hello food safety).

I was waiting for my burrito to be made when I received a phone call I had been waiting to place another order when a lady came out from the kitchen area to basically tell me while I was still on the phone: “For future reference, don’t talk on the phone while getting your order done”and then went back in the kitchen.

I understand it’s rude to be on a call while ordering but it’s also rude to interrupt someone who is on the phone - about to purchase another one of your products which the staff who was on her phone earlier then proceeded to “lovingly” make (check photo for reference).

I may not be a frequent customer but “for future reference” I may just be a lot more infrequent due to the quality of service and product I experienced.

Text: It's hard to make sense of this restaurant.

As you can see from the photos, it's a beautiful venue, with so much potential.

Pre-covid, this was a pleasant restaurant with a good menu. The standards, service and overall quality have fallen since they re-opened post-covid.

The menu online does not reflect what's actually available. The service is slow (I've only ever seen one person occasionally present for the staff, often you have to seek someone after sitting in an empty restaurant for 5+ minutes), and the food is adequate at best. Their steak ordered medium rare was more medium-done. They advertise wagyu on their website but only standard supermarket steak in reality.

The only redeeming feature is they are part of the AccorPlus program, so up to 50% off food.

I really wish they'd put more effort into this restaurant, there is so much potential. Even just reaching pre-covid standards would be nice.

Positive point, their laksa entry for the 2023 laksa festival was really good.

Text: Do not come here. The worst restaurant I have ever been to. The bruschetta was not bruschetta. On no planet does cheese and capsicum belong on a bruschetta. The gnocchi was obviously microwaved and not worthy of the price. Several people ordered steak but the waiter got mixed up and attempted to give us schnitzel instead which belonged to another table. The wait was quite long despite the lack of customers. Terrible for a Novotel, and quite embarassing to have this hotel restaurant. Seriously do not come here. A lot of issues with hotel management to look at.

Text: Zest is a great restaurant for a romantic date. The esplanade is there for an after #dessert stroll. #butterchicken ($25) looks and smell delicious. Very well presented, visually appealing, the spicy aroma makes me hungry. The mango chutney is nice little palate distraction. Waitress is very helpful and friendly, efficient chef, kind manager (review courtesy of manager and chef). Centrally located to #CBD and #park.

Text: Scotch fillet ordered.
The serving staff were nice and friendly.
The portion was good for one hungry person.

I wish there was an affordable rump steak option as well.
Both scotch fillets I tried here in Darwin and the recent one from Sydney gave me a strong impression that it seems not worth paying more for scotch fillet over rump steak if available.
Value for the price was not impressive.

Still in overall, Over 4 stars for atmosphere and staff.

This versatile venue also cater for evening and weekend functions.
Can get very busy on the weekends if you dine-in but takeaway coffee and pastries is quick and easy.
Chilli scrambled eggs is my favourite very filling, full of flavours and satisfying.
Friendly staff, good customer service and great coffee.
The juices of the day is a great alternative, if you don’t drink coffee.
You could easily compare it to a trendy Melbourne cafe.

The pickled ginger in the Okonominyaki balanced the whole dish and the flavours were popping. The Chili Scram had a good amount of crab and the sliced red chilis gave the dish a good hit of spice. The croissant was one of the best we have had in Darwin - buttery, flaky and melts in your mouth. Coffee was good and excellent service. First of many visits to this place!!

Text: We had a family dinner here to welcome in 2020.

Firstly the front of house staff were outstanding. Couldn’t do enough to ensure we had a great experience.

We all had a bit of a review of each of our dishes. The only main that wasn’t better than a 4 was the Mangrove Jack chefs special. It lacked depth of flavour and was topped with a creme fraiche or sour cream that was still almost frozen.

The tuna also could have benefited from a little more seasoning. Although was very good.

So with the marginal negatives out the way the other dishes including the oysters were exemplary.

The eye fillet was cooked to absolute perfection and melted in the mouth. The green pepper Jus was the best I’ve had.

Every dessert was outstanding. But a special mention must go to the star of the evening which fortunately was mine. The Parfait. Explosions of flavour. Divine.

Our waiter’s wine matching was on point.

Thank you.

Buyer beware! Don’t normally do this but sorry, if a business is going to take my Money there’s a minimum standard that needs to be met. This didn’t even come close.
1. Spring rolls are half pastry inside
2. Cheese naan is just a frozen packet triangle naan with cheese melted on top. Didn’t even try to hide the fact this was completely manufactured.
3. Butter naan had no butter. At least it was cut up and semi resembled something that may have been made from scratch!
4. Butter chicken is literally Heinz tomato soup with chicken in it.

Just not good enough. Not sure what else to say 😤

Text: I ordered the Thai green curry with rice and roti, the rice and roti were decent quality but the curry was essentially an oil soup. It wasn't curry, I couldn't scoop anything with the roti as it was literally a soup. I tasted it and it was incredibly spicy for what's supposed to be a mild, coconut based curry so I decided against eating it at all as it wasn't what I ordered, and for $46 total it was a massive disappointment. Wouldn't recommend this place and I definitely won't be ordering from here again.

Last year Crust Pizza was good,however something has changed and in my opinion,they changed the speed of the convey oven(much faster) and increase the temperature of the oven and the result is a Pizza always thin as ice and dry as hell with burned cheese and condiments. I will surely order somewhere else next time,unless they will train the rookies working there or they will choose quality over quantity.Terrible Terrible Terrible Pizza.The picture looks better than what it was because I added oil and new ingredients on the top.

Pizza was okay so I give 2 stars.
Then I am subtracting a star for charging extra for sauce. A basic human right. Sauce should be free for the people.
So total coming in at 1 star.

Location is at the back of the carpark. The space has limitations due to positioning and there is industrial noise around. Even though it's brewery door rather than classic pub vibe, I would recommend some improvements to the outdoor area. I acknowledge that we visited in March with 32 degrees and 75% humidity!
