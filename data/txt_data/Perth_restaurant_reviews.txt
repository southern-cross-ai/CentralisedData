Text: Staff and location excellent.

Unfortunately It‚Äôs beyond outdated.

Broken dishwasher. Washing machine leaked. Mould and inbuilt grime in bathrooms. Aircon/heater worked but broken buttons. Stained lampshades and stains on carpet. Inbuilt grime in kitchen. Dirty balcony. Lift makes noises 24/7. Dirty and stained walls. Pool is not heated as advertised. Limited items in the kitchen.

The cleaners can only do so much as it‚Äôs clear no maintenance has been done in some time.

Whilst we can never expect photos to match the reality, this is false advertising. They need to be clearer about the state of the place and adjust the price accordingly.

They also deduct a $200 bond on arrival which is a real cheek given there‚Äôs no room service, nothing in the room to purchase and the state of the place.

Had I paid $215 a night instead of $315, I wouldn‚Äôt be feeling as ripped off as I do right now.

Go elsewhere is my recommendation.

Text: The apartments were good. There were a few concerns. There were 2 lifts. They made a loud clanging noise. I wondered if there was a safety issue. ? It was worrying. In the apartment some carpet was frayed in 2 places especially in entry to the bathroom. Could be a tripping hazard. The other matter was the tiles in the bathroom were very dirty/mouldy at floor level and around the bottom of the shower. Everything else was excellent.

Text: We booked a premium 2 bedroom apartment.
The staff were friendly and helpful.
The apartment itself did not meet our expectations and definitely not premium. Both bedrooms had king beds though the rooms were small and we had to put our suitcases in the living area. One bedroom had no windows so no natural light and the other room faced the street, and you could hear the noise from the bar below.
There was a lot of dust in the bedrooms mainly in wardrobes.
There was also a loud banging noise we could hear in our apartment which appeared to come from the lifts. Hopefully not a safety issue.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to others or stay here again.

Text: The location is good, the room was decent but the lounge is incredibly uncomfortable and on the last night that I was there the air conditioner stopped turning on.

The main problem I have with this place is the card system. It is one of those card insert systems but sometimes it doesn't register your card for at least 3-4 times. One time I tried 7 times. This is SO frustrating when you get into the elevator and while you are trying to use the card someone on one of the top floors calls the elevator and then you are stuck in it riding it, going all the way to the top, then picking up any others that have called the elevator on the way down. What should be a 20 second trip to level 3 ends up being a 3 min scenic tour of the entire building.

Text: The hotel was a great location for our needs, very central and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable however we had issues with the television remote not working on several occasions and the staff reset the TV, replaced batteries but we still couldn't turn down the volume. There is only one mirror which was an issue with two females sharing the room. We booked a table for nine people for a family gathering and even though I selected an inside table, when we arrived at 7pm on a chilly evening our table had been organised to be outside. The staff were very obliging and quickly reorganised an inside table. The meal was very nice although had quite a wait for it to arrive.

We also used the airport shuttle and would recommend, as well as took the staff advice and did a day trip to Rottnest Island, which turned out to be the highlight of our holiday. When we booked directly through them we got a free continental breakfast included with our stay.

Google street view showed some coffee shops and a bottle store next door, but those have been closed and new flats are being built there so plan accordingly.

Would happily recommend this place to friends and family, and would book again if we find ourselves in Perth again.

Place: The Terrace Hotel

Text: This review is about The Terrace Hotel as a food and drinks location rather than a hotel, and the summary is, it's fantastic!

The space is very interesting with its combination of vintage furniture, crown moulding and eclectic lighting finished off with modern touches from art pieces and the gorgeous bar area. There are several different rooms for bar/restaurant guests to sit and share each others company, allowing you to choose a space that suits your vibe. We opted to sit in the back room for a quiet dinner together before retiring to a room with a fireplace and loads of comfy couches for post dinner drinks.

It was at this point that I suddenly became aware of how incredible the music selection was. Lexi and Jack had curated an amazing mix of chilled-out tunes that really brought the atmosphere of the venue up a notch.

Food and drinks themselves were really lovely and really good value. I had the Korean Fried Chicken Burger and my partner had the Halloumi Burger and both of us were stuffed and very satisfied. The only downside, if I'm digging for one, is that the selection of dinner options was a little thin, particularly for vegetarians.

All-in-all, an awesome place and we'll definitely be back! Thanks Lexi and Jack!

Text: The morning of our stay, we received a phone call to say the room had been double booked which was extremely disappointing. I was told this has never happened, but reading other reviews, it‚Äôs not the first time. The solution to this was that the owner had an Air BnB and said we could stay there for the first night and then move to a hotel down the road for the second night. When arriving at the Air BnB, we turned up to the owner‚Äôs personal house and her bedroom was ‚Äòour‚Äô room. There were personal belongings all throughout the room and it was dirty. The bathroom was a shared bathroom at the back of the house with all of the owners personal toiletries, throughout. The booking was for a private stay with our own apartment so to then be presented with this, was disgraceful.

Text: Great place for a couple to stay. Is a little tricky to find but once you are here you can enjoy Fremantle at your leisure. The breakfast is very good and we enjoyed it very much. The only criticism I have is that the fan above the end of the bed is in bad need of a clean. I would suggest to anyone booking a room that you carry an overnight bag as the stairs are a little tight for large suitcases. Otherwise everything as far as we were concerned was great. The ladies that do the cleaning and prepare the breakfast tray are very friendly and helpful nothing is a problem for them.

Text: I was so disappointed on arrival to find out that the room I had booked had been double booked even though I had booked months in advance. Instead of a room with a lovely balcony overlooking the garden courtyard I was designated the least desirable room in the hotel with a balcony looking at a brick wall. Not even sky view. The room was small with only space for a bed and 2 dining chairs at the foot of the bed so I felt quite claustrophobic without a window to look outside. The courtyard garden whilst it is lovely is not available for guests to use for sitting and relaxing as there are private residences within the complex. There is no parking available for guests. There was no opportunity for me to negotiate with the property manager. He wasn't interested and behaved as if he held no responsibility for ensuring that my stay was a pleasant one. He made no offers to investigate or find a solution to the problem. It's a shame that my experience of exploring Fremantle was not as positive as it could have been. Whilst Fremantle was great, I really didn't enjoy staying in the tiny  hotel room with a window and a balcony faciing a brick wall. I will stay home and catch the train to Fremantle next time. I will save over $500 and still enjoy the sights of Fremantle.

Room was quiet even though overlooking Mounts Bay Rd intersection.
I was disappointed the pool and spa are not heated. I hope they update their information accordingly and stop saying it's heated.
As you can see from over reviews the rooms have a few maintenance issues and are due for a revamp.  Freezer didn't work, problem with TV and remotes. All reported so they know.

Would stay again and looking forward to seeing improvements on our next visit. Thanks for a nice stay.

Text: This was our very first time visiting Perth.   The Adina Hotel was a very good choice to stay in.  Very clean and the atmosphere, staff and service was great.   The only negative we have is that the cook top had a greasy film on top of it, and the range hood didn't sit flush like it was supposed to.   On closer inspection, there was a broken piece that had broken off onto the cook top.

We left the room daily and returned in the evening to find fresh towels in the bathroom and rubbish removed, which was nice....on one of the days our bed was made (I made it most days)

Adina is very central so you're very close to cafes, restaurants and shops.   Amazing, we'll definitely be back!!!

Text: The lady that checked us in and checked us out 10-16 June was very lovely and definitely helped make our experience more enjoyable. The rooms are a little bit dated, the main frustration was actually using the elevators and outer doors because the key slots don't read that card properly so it takes a few attempts. The rooms are cleaned daily which was quite nice to have and the location is very convenient, not far from the action of the CBD at all, majority of the city can be reached in 15-20 minute walk. It was our first time visiting Perth, and the hotel did help provide a memorable experience. I have alsp stayed with Adina previously in Sydney and would be happy to do so again.

Text: Absolutely disappointed.
The whole reason we chose hotel for our stay was due to the promoted heated pool and HEATED jacuzzi and we paid for the late check out so we could use these services.
Neither of these things were heated to even close to an appropriate temperature. When we questioned reception on the lack of heat they informed us it was set to 20 degrees. This is not adequate to advertise yourself as having a heated pool/jacuzzi.
Heated pools should be heated to between 27-30 and hot tubs/jacuzzi should be heated well into the mid 30s.
Zero compensation was offered.

Also promoting the fine/dining and bar available when its not open at all until 5pm I can respect and understand the restaurant/bar not being open out of peak times..  but choosing not to heat your pool or jacuzzi makes me think you're choosing to keep it cold so guests don't want to use it so you don't have to clean it.

Will not be recommending to any friends or family.

The pool and spa facilities were closed for renovations, which was slightly disappointing, but understandable. Location is amazing, however, there is a very loud night club just below that did keep me up on the weekend. If you are a light sleeper, this may affect your experience on the weekends. Overall, I had an excellent stay and I will be booking with Rendezvous again for my next trip to Perth.

Text: Very dated rooms and very poorly soundproofed glazing (so you'll hear each of the many V8 engines and motorbikes pulling away from the major road junction right outside the hotel).

Probably only hotel on earth with 1) no USB charging sockets in the rooms, 2) using halogen lighting rather than LED and 3) twin taps on the shower (it's fiddly to not get scorched or frozen. Also the tiled bathroom floor isn't flat so there's a pool of water in the middle of the bathroom every time you shower.

Text: This hotel is in such a nice area, and has so much potential if they improve a couple of things. The first would be a refurbishment of- pretty much everything. Painting on outside, carpets/bed/tv/pain in room/furniture in room as most of it was damaged or just old (bathroom was nice though) and the pool area (such a big space yet barely any shade and seating). There was no staff member by the pool and even with all the ‚Äòno climbing‚Äô and ‚Äòno diving‚Äô signs there was kids jumping from those marked areas and splashing water everywhere. Two kids fell in the short time I was there. It also doesn‚Äôt smell like chlorine at all and the water was quite dirty (especially the spa was like yellow), and a few kids were spitting into the water as well which was disappointing. Quite a unique pool though with the waterfall.

There was no music or nice smell in the lobby either (crown is impressive with the atmosphere) and the staff members were incredibly serious. $25 for parking if you drive as well. I recommend booking the sea view room though, it was beautiful to wake up with such a nice view. Lots of bars and food places and dessert venues around as well which was why I picked this place. I probably wouldn‚Äôt book the buffet breakfast next time as its not the best and there are so many other places around. Overall a relatively nice experience.

Text: Oh dear where do i start.... I literally can't find anything positive to say about my stay here.
I booked a suite for my stay. The first night I was exhausted and I arrived at the suite only to see that it wasn't clean. I mean it was very very dirty. I documented some of the worst offending issues and slept fully clothed on top of more of my clothes.
Went downstairs the next morning to let the concierge desk know what state it was in and showed a few of the photos I took and I was told that I could have another suite if I did not mind moving, I replied as long as it is clean that will be fine.
When suite was ready I collected my new room card's and I am still gobsmacked that this is what passed for clean! The balcony door handle came off while i was outside that night because inside was so dirty and dusty and right next to the lift. 11pm and im locked on a balcony with the door handle in my hand in the dark(because my light didn't work). Thank goodness I didn't stumbled in the dark. Used to torch from my phone and I managed to get the handle back through the slots and I opened the door....but it now would not lock. Too on edge to manage to sleep knowing that my balcony door was not locked I proceeded to take photographs of the second rooms filthy state
I had been told that management would be in Monday morning to discuss my ordeal. Being told that the manager was coming in to listen to my complaint I was taken aback to be told it was the desk manager who was dealing with my complaint while I had been led to believe that the actual hotel manager is whom I would be speaking with. The desk manager was lovely but she had only been authorised over the phone by the hotel manager to discount me 30% off only the last night of my stay. That was all she had been authorised to offer me. There was no option to get to talk to her or show her the photograph's I had taken of both rooms and obvious safety issues I had encountered and photos of maintenance and repairs that are not up to code.
For $253.50 a night (and I was there for 3 night's that were exhausting) so $750 plus $200 bond to get the privilege of staying in absolute filthy conditions I was refunded a measly 30% off the last nights paid rate.... basically sweet bugger all.
Upon checkout the couple in front of me had been complaining about there stay also.
So to wrap up this review I would recommend that of you see this apparent "resort" when youbare looking for somewhere nice to stay, keep scrolling unless you want to experience in my opinion the most expensive, filthy and disappointing places possible
Would give -5* if I could

In response to the pagados reply I will say that I am glad that you have addressed the cleanliness of the place. The complimentary breakfast was actually because I had room service the first night and it was inedible as it was cold and soggy so I did appreciate the  breakfast to compensate for that. I also ended up 'extending' my stay for the third night as my alarm didn't go off in the morning to check out as this room had zero USB points and when I asked the gentleman who was on the front desk where i may find one he said that he didn't know. This is the same gentleman who made me the offer of swapping room's when I first complained and just to clarify on what the pagoda have claimed that I said and happened, I never was taken up to inspect the new room when it was ready. The key fob was handed to me at the front desk. Later when i came down regarding the usb point and to ask for a top sheet I did actually say to him that while it was better than the first room in my opinion it was most definitely not clean. My alarm not waking me meant that I slept past check out(my phone had gone flat) is the ONLY reason i extended my stay. I most certainly couldn't inform you regarding the balcony door handle coming off in my hand as that happened at 11pm on my last night there.
Just wanted to clarify. Which is why it would have been good to be able to speak with the hotel manager that morning as i had neen told i would.

The bed was extremely uncomfortable with pillows lumpy and hard with a doona that was a size too small for the bed. This hotel is certainly not a 4 star hotel, nowhere near.

Old review: Oh Miss Mauds Smorgasboard. What a joyful place. The collection of gallant and graceful hospitality staff truly go far to make your visit an enjoyable one. They consistently ask you how you‚Äôre doing, is the food alright, and they scoop your employ plates away faster than you can turn around sometimes. Each and every time I come, whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner I leave feeling like it was a good use of time and money. It‚Äôs by far one of the most pricey buffet I‚Äôve been to. With breakfast at $27 seven days a weeks, lunch at $45 on weekends and dinner at $55 it‚Äôs not for the frugal amongst us. The best of the lunch is the giant pavlova and the muscles in cream sauce. The endless string coffee is a fav of mine, as I like to stick around the whole meal and eat slowly, so my many a cup of joe helps is flow.

The selections of food from seafood, salads, hot dishes and desserts were delicious. In particular the beef brisket which was melt in your mouth and deserved 5 stars of its own  - and I'm not a huge fan of beef! All the desserts were so yum, many are sold in Miss Maud cafes. Our only "gripe": the chocolate mousse is overly sweet. It was like the chef sneezed while adding the sugar and accidentally put in 200% sugar. The birthday balloons were a lovely surprise as was the musician who came to our table with a slice of chocolate "birthday" cake aka Queen Silvia. Breakfast was a laid back relaxing affair with equally efficient and friendly staff. The crepes are very addictive and so mouth watering. Everything else was standard breakfast buffet fare all well cooked and nicely presented.  Of note: the two male staff members who manned the restaurant reception at dinner and breakfast (sorry don't know their names) were so lovely and welcoming. They are a great choice to be the "face" of the restaurant. Would definitely recommend dining here.

Text: Firstly: any individual over the age of 10 yrs that uses the word "yummy" in a written review, deserves to be drowned in a warm bucket of milk!

I can recommend the breakfast buffet here - for $27, it covers all the bases. Fresh, excellent drip coffee,(which in itself is a rarity these days with espresso/latte etc) juices and all the breakfast items you can expect. The pancakes and fresh whipped cream were also a nice addition.

The decor is a bit dated, but that didn't interfere with enjoying the food. To correct another reviewer, breakfast starts at 6:45am. I don't know where he got the 8:30am from? The staff are extremely welcoming and friendly. Worth a visit.

Text: WOW...!!  I'm sorry but I've had to change my review regarding the ICONIC MISS MAUD RESTAURANT & HOTEL...

It is now called the NEMONIC... I haven't actually been here since it changed ownership, I remember when it was called The European Hotel, so I'm sorry that I had to edit my past review.... Unfortunately, The  Miss Maud Restaurant & Hotel is now gone forever...  Among many other companies, especially small business owners in Perth...

I will leave the photos here, just so we don't forget the awesome restaurant, especially the pastry shop which had some delicious cakes... Miss Maud Caf√®s are still around Perth.  City Arcade, Hay Street West & The Carillon Arcade..

I'll have to go visit NEMONIC so I can write a decent review... The exterior is still the same...

restaurant was packed, the atmosphere was buzzing and lively. the place itself is bright and colourful.

the food was delicious, what we ordered came with salads, waitstaff are quick and efficient and lovely. they actually asked if we wanted our chips with our mains, or as a side-to-our-mains, which we all though was really considerate.

we have an allergy in the family (which we wrote in the booking) and the waitstaff mentioned it and clarified with us - which when u have an allergy it really helps with anxiety.

100% recommend booking - u literally would NOT get a spot without it.

we ordered a beef burrito, seafood enchilada and beef quaesadilas with hot chips to start.

And don't even get me started on their carne asada‚Äîit's grilled to perfection and basically melts in your mouth. Oh, and did I mention their margaritas? Trust me, you'll want to try one (or three).The vibe at Pancho's is cozy and welcoming, with colorful decor that screams ¬°Viva M√©xico! It's the kind of place where you can kick back with friends or bring the whole fam for a fiesta.And the service? A+. The staff here is super friendly and always down to chat about their favorite dishes or mix up a custom salsa just for you.So, next time you're in the mood for some Mexican goodness, do yourself a favor and hit up Pancho's Mexican Villa. Your taste buds will thank you. ¬°Buen provecho!

My wife and I were looking a nice place to have a sit down dinner on New Year‚Äôs Day and it was pretty hard to say the least! Luckily I remembered our local Indian takeaway had a nice interior set up (I pick up our orders from time to time and remembered it was always very presentable), after a quick call to check they were serving in house we showed up and got a nice booth table.

The food was amazing! We were served by the owner Tilak and I asked him to give us his most recommended dishes. After a quick discussion on our spice levels he returned with 2 curries and some side dishes. The goat was absolutely amazing, and of course their butter chicken was one of there most ordered (and one of the best I‚Äôve had).

I would highly recommend this place for anyone who loves a good sit down dinner, it‚Äôs really affordable and the service is great. I‚Äôll be back to try the buffet!

I am sorry have to write this.

CONS
This is for sure not palak paneer, the paneer pieces are taken out of red gavy and  added to  this, may be runing low in paneer Or left over from other gravy thats why tasted stale.
The order said no chili, but to my surprise black pepper was added in that which made it more spicy and peppry.
Sugar was added to make it Sweet..........
Sorry to say if that's the palak paneer than I should stop eating it.

PROS. Paratha was very good.

The menu is slightly different from their website, so they had a couple of extra vegetarian dishes. But not enough for us to order, and we won't be returning unless they have a few more options.
The only vegan dish is a garden salad, so if you're vegan you're out of luck.

There were a few dirty tables with staff not doing much, so that could be addressed.
Service was ok, atmosphere is ok.

The breakfast was served from 0630-1030, allowing enough time for the early risers and late comers to have a meal.
The range of hot and cold food are quite good, but it‚Äôs mainly western with a very small section for Asian being the steamed dumplings.
They also have a small section catering gluten free with a dedicated toaster for gluten free section too. The omelette station is always a welcome touch because we can order our eggs made to order.
Service was good, and we even got a hot chocolate made by the barista because the coffee machine didn‚Äôt have a hot chocolate option at Monty‚Äôs as compared to the one in the Pacific Club Lounge on Level 7.

We went there for HIGHT TEA for 2 people.  We asked for Halal option .

They cut half of the items on the list (which i understand that wasn‚Äôt halal friendly) and served But they didn‚Äôt replace it with the ones we could have.

At least they should have upend the quantity of the item which were halal friendly to balance it out since we paid $138 for 2.

The seafood was the main draw for me. The mussels were succulent and fresh, prawns were juicy and sweet and the crabs were tasty and reasonably meaty. As you can see, I went for three rounds of it.

There were other offerings too and they were quite nice. The desserts were good too and being a chocoholic, I only went for those and I was satisfied with their selection and quality.

It was a good meal.

The menu is sufficiently comprehensive without going overboard. The wine list was adequate and the cocktails on offer were better than I'd expected (you can ask for the classics even if they're not on the menu).

The atmosphere was welcoming and gives the hint that one will be warmly received and well looked after.

The food and drink were very nice and they were served up in good quality dishes and glasses.

Sadly the experience is cheapened by the use of plastic table numbers, paper table covers and the use of paper napkins which did not match the price of the dishes being served.

I look forward to my next visit and I hope that I'll have reason to give a better rating.

We were heading to the Norfolk Hotel tonight for their amazing meat board with vegetable board, but on the way back to our accommodation, stumbled across Joy Kitchen.

It was Saturday  they only open on the evening at weekends, however it looked lovely through the window.

Come 6:30 pm we decided Joy kitchen would be the go tonight, so rang to see if we could book at short notice.

They said we are busy, but if you can come at 7:45 pm that would be ok.

We wandered down Arundel Street where we were staying and as we turned the corner, we could see every table was full, good to see, but our heart sank.

All good though, our table was reserved and our waiter attentively opened our byo wine and brought the right glasses.

The menu was fairly concise compared to other Chinese restaurants, but definately considered.

You will see from the pictures, we were very pleased with the dishes we ordered, and highly recommend them all.

However................ what made it the perfect night for celebrating Samanths's birthday weekend was the attention to detail from the staff....... absolutely outstanding and a compliment to the owners who I believe have been in business for 27 years... no wonder.

Thank you to Jeff, for the attention to detail.... he brought love bird candles, a birthday ice cream with candle and even sang happy birthday.

Text: Excellent place to stay which is close to everything. The Manager, Susanne communicated with us when we booked, and before we arrived,  with check in details. Breakfast was fantastic with many dietary needs catered for. The Down Under room, where we stayed had a kitchenette with microwave, kettle and refrigerator. Beds have good quality linen and are comfortable. High standard of cleanliness and tastefully furnished. An IGA supermarket is walking distance from the B & B. Beautiful historic buildings line the surrounding streets.  One evening we ate at Cage Roads Brewery, on the Fremantle waterfront; at sunset, which was very good. The train station is walking distance, and is on the direct line to Perth Station. Thoroughly recommend staying at Fremantle B & B.

The rooms were clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable I‚Äôve had in a hotel. The location was fantastic and close to everything.
I was also impressed with the sound proofing of the room. We stayed on level 2 above the restaurants which were quite noisy but the moment we closed the door no noise came into the room at all.

The area was nice, rooms were perfect for what we needed (comfy bed, tv, sitting area, microwave, coffee/tea/kettle, ensuite) and it had a pool and a playground. The staff were great to deal with and were so efficient when I emailed them to ask them if I could book an adjoining room for one of the nights. We were driving to Perth at this time and were out of service but they just sorted it so easily. Nothing felt like it was hard or too much of an ask.
We then left an item at the accommodation, and the staff were easily to work with for me to arrange someone to collect. Will definitely be back.

- the Grove Grill was great, we dined on our last night. Family friendly. I would absolutely attend this to eat at even if I was not staying in the accommodation
- everything was clean and well presented

-parking was secure and our car was less than 2 metres of our front door of our room

I attempted to contact room service multiple times without success. Eventually, I had to retrieve my breakfast myself, only to find that the eggs were improperly cooked.

Aside from this issue, the room is very comfortable.

As we had a relatively large group over 12, we were asked to order in advanced the days before to facilitate the serving on the day. Unfortunately their email system had some issues which resulted in us having to email our pre order again. However we were advised again on the morning that they will take our order from the table after all.
They were also a little understaffed on the day as there were only 2 staff working, which  included the manager, aka waitress aka bar tender aka barista.

Onion loaf had an incredible spicy BBQ Mayo but the leaf was pretty greasy. The rib sampler is a delicious spread, with a tasty coleslaw but too much sweet BBQ sauce across the 3 ribs. Would be great to have a dry rub or less sweet style rib option. The beef ribs are an absolute treat.

Fried chicken burger was tasty but chicken fillet was also deceptively small.

Text: If you're craving some of the best baby back ribs in Perth, look no further than Tony Roma's. This family-friendly restaurant has become our go-to spot for satisfying our rib cravings.

The baby back ribs are the star of the show - fall-off-the-bone tender, smothered in their signature sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. They're meaty, flavorful, and downright addictive. We always get one full rack per person that comes with a side of coleslaw, the perfect accompaniment. The baked potatoes are fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, corn is nicely charred, mash potatoes are creamy and well seasoned and you can also swap the sides for fries. And don't skip the onion loaf - it's a Tony Roma signature.

Service is usually friendly and attentive. The casual vibe makes it a comfortable spot for a laid-back meal.

Prices are a tad high as we often spend about $80-$100 per person. We wish we could afford to dine here more frequently! But for a periodic rib fix, Tony Roma's is well worth the splurge. The quality and flavors are consistently delicious.

If you haven't tried Tony Roma's yet, rib lovers shouldn't miss this Perth city gem. Just be sure to bring a hearty appetite and some enjoyable company!

Text: This restaurant has a most beautiful view of the ocean from south of rotness to way north of rotness. Given that there were storms this afternoon and evening the view was outstanding
The layout and decor is very basic. It certainly looks like someone has tried to improve it but it failed. The toilets, funny enough, are quite clean and modern.
The food had a lot to be desired. Being a wedding I do not know what they charged but there was way too much oil and seasoning that devalued the taste.

Text: The atmosphere is superb!
Such gorgeous beach and location.

The service is good. Friendly staff.

The food we ordered are OK. Very expensive but definitely have room for improvement.

The calamari we ordered were very dry and chewy (as you can see it was cut so thin hence when frying it has to be quick or it will be dry and chewy).

The salad which accompanied our Barramundi was very bland. It needs more zest.

The pork bites were gorgeous but so tiny serve.

I will come back for drinks and venue. The food certainly needs more room for improvement.

Good sushi chain shop. Just reopened for dinner at weekend after COVID outbreak. Old staff and new staff are polite. Sushi chef were wearing gloves to make sushi, but at least one also touched everything with the same gloves. No hand washing so far. New staff need more training. Not attentive. Food hygiene is very important!

New menu. The size, variety, qaulity and portions of suishi and food are similar to pre-COVID. Reasonable Price. Some dishes on the chain are not on menu. Just see the plate color, and know the price.

But now, No dinner sets that's very good value are not available. Pickled Ginger and wasabi is pre-packed now. Crab balls are not served with Spicy mayonnaise. It's just mayonnaise.

Not a great fan of QR code menus (I'm old and cranky) and the background music was a little too loud, for us, to hold a decent conversation without raising our voices a little. it probably would have been better sitting outside, noise-wise. Loos were clean and the staff were very pleasant and helpful.

For 2 nights the wifi was not working on my side of the accommodation area, I had to keep buying credit on my phone and using hot spot which ended up being more expensive. I contacted the host and she informed me the internet inside was working fine and they are doing NBN maintenance, I usually stream movies/tv shows on my laptop so after a while I got bored and asked if I could have a refund and check out early, I was not issued a refund and ended up checking out early, if a place advertises ‚Äúfree wifi‚Äù and it is not working I believe you should get a refund if you leave because the service being payed for is not being received, will definitely not stay again, the room was okay and clean, it was a private entrance but yeah I‚Äôd rather go to a hotel for that amount of money.

It felt like anything she had to do for us was a huge effort and we felt really upset and unwanted. We are not competitors we are legitimate customers who have been to quite a few B&Bs and usually love the experience and we always give credit where credit is due.

Text: I recently dined at C Restaurant and was thoroughly impressed. The panoramic city views created a stunning ambiance, perfect for a special occasion to make it memorable. The service was top-notch; our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable.

The food was exquisite, with each dish beautifully presented and bursting with flavours. The drink selection was extensive, and the mocktails were expertly crafted. Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience, combining excellent service, delicious food, and a breathtaking view from the window seat.

**Rating: 5/5**

Looking forward to visiting again!

Text: My partner surprised me by taking me here for my birthday. Staff were friendly & very professional. The atmosphere was very romantic, we were given a window seat to take in the views.
The views were gorgeous. Being from out of state I got to see most of Perth's night life.
The food was delectable, The menu was very well planned with all items ordered pairing well together. Everything was cooked to perfection. The seared scallops were to die for, melt in your mouth & very flavourful.
Our waiter surprised me with a desert at the end of our meal to celebrate my birthday. This was a truly amazing experience.
I would definitely recommend & would love to return one day.

Text: Beautiful high tea! The food was delicious! Beautiful views! Staff were very friendly and attentive.
The only negative would be that the jam was not homemade, which for me would have made the scones much nicer!!
We will definitely be back though! Fingers crossed for yummy jam on our next visit üòã ü§û

Text: A wonderful celebratory lunch today with 2 friends. Booked a guaranteed window seat to ensure the best views. Caught the train in so we didn‚Äôt need to worry about sampling the excellent wine menu with our delicious food. Decided to have a main each with extra roasted vegetables, then 3 different desserts to share using fresh plates.  Awesome! Could not fault anything. Some might find the main meal servings slightly on the small size but they were perfect for us. Thoroughly recommend this venue and well worth the expense for a special occasion.
