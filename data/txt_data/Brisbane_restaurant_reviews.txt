Text: I stayed there for 3 nights while on a trip to Brisbane to see family. It is great location, because it's opposite central station, and has bus stops near by, and easy access to all the cbd touristy stuff that you might want to do. The rooms are great. The staff are great. Only downside is that it doesn't have a restaurant which means no breakfast included and no room service. It would be nice if they were able to make arrangements with a restaurant or 2 and/or a cafe or 2 near by to make up for this. That's the only major downside for me. But I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.

Text: We stayed here one night because it’s close to central station and we needed to get a proper rest before our two day journey back to Europe. Sadly it wasn’t a pleasant stay. Al six o’clock in the morning they cleaned the floors outside our room with an incredibly loud carpet cleaner banging it against our walls and door…
I hoped it would stop quickly and I would be able to sleep a bit more but they went on for quite some time and we weren’t the only people woken up by that noise.
I mean ppl come here on holiday, not to be woken up like that…
We told reception and the reaction was: sorry about that. She didn’t seem surprise though…

Rooms are well equipped and big, everything was clean so maybe if you are a deep sleeper  this is the place for you.

I definitely wouldn’t stay here again nor recommend it. Whoever made that cleaning schedule didn’t consider their guests and it isn’t exactly a cheap accommodation to stay at.

Context: I created a family catchup for which I self-paid (thanks to inheritence) over 2 nights & it was EXQUISITE & worth every cent 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼✅✅✅🤩🤩🤩

Details: I arrived late last Friday night (due to Virgin Australia delayed flight) for my room. Older male receptionist was a completely understanding sweetheart & I got straight in to my beautiful first 1 bedroom room (pics attached)

Next day cousins & Aunty & Uncle arrived for their rooms, including a suite I shared with a cuz whose been in a wheelchair for 41 years.

2 young women receptionists Saturday were also total sweethearts & they were also the Valets to park the cars. They did a great job.

Sat night we returned late & all of us (incl Aunty & Uncle who are 80 years old!) had been eating drinking for almost 10 hours (so I needed to “Quiet them down” by my own choice!). Yet again staff were superb & put up very politely with us “noisy old people” 😂😂😂

The building is divinely restored & still has very high ceilings & is immaculately clean & maintained.

It co$t a bit more than I usually spend but that said, I almost never stay in the heart of the CBD of any city anymore. If I won lotto, I’d stay here every single time I return to Brisvegas (the city I grew up in & left the day after my graduation from UQ in 1995).

The building is beautiful. The staff are excellent & genuinely helpful & caring. And a great pub is across the street. Definitely worth spending $ on for a brilliant fambo catch up 🥰✅ Thanks to all staff who supported us - all of you were brilliant 😘😘😘 x

Text: I stayed to see a show at the Princess Theatre right next door. The staff were friendly and helpful. There's a great variety of dining options close by, and the hotel offers a great buffet breakfast for $25.
If you want a gym, they offer free use of the 24/7 gym close by. There is gated parking outback included in your very reasonable tariff. The rooms are quiet and comfortable.
I only had two small peeves. The toilet roll holder is on the wall beside the toilet, making it almost impossible to reach without getting up from the toilet. Think about what that means for a second. The other is that the wardrobe is a few centimetres short in depth, which means that once you hang a coat on the hanger, the hanger sits crooked, or it's difficult to close the door.
I'd stay again if seeing a show.

Text: We had to stay nearby the Mater Hospital while our little boy was in intensive care, and I honestly could not have asked for a more accommodating, caring and hospitable reception from every one of the team members at the Hotel. We had to make multiple changes due to unpredictable nature of the hospital stay and every single time the staff obliged, exceeded expectations and did it with a smile making us feel like anything we asked was absolutely no problem.

We stayed in 2 different rooms over our stay, both were clean, well appointed and regularly maintained.

This is now my go to hotel anytime I need to be near Woolloongabba. Prices extremely fair, parking was easy, location is so convenient.

Thanks again to the entire team for your hospitality in a difficult time for our family.

Text: I can't express my gratitude enough for the wonderful team at this hotel. My husband was air lifted from central Queensland to the Mater Hospital with multiple organ failure. He was not expected to survive. The staff at this hotel bent over backwards to accommodate me and the children and grand babies at this very stressful time. Dan found rooms that didn't seem to be there and spent so much time shuffling rooms to fit us in at different times. His support and encouragement made such a difference to me, especially his kind words every morning as I left for the hospital not knowing what would happen each day. My husband has survived and I can't thank Dan enough for his kindness and compassion, a truly wonderful human being. Service over and above when I really needed it.

Place: Treasury Casino and Hotel Brisbane

Text: I I went to this casino a few times, and it was fine at first until one time I got carried away and lost several thousand dollars. I felt it was time to stop and wanted to sign a self-exclusion. When I took out the self-exclusion I signed last year at The Star Sydney, I found that Treasury Casino was also included. I only remembered the person responsible for the agreement asking if I wanted to include The Crown Casino, but I didn't expect Treasury Casino to be in it as well.

If I already signed it, why was I still able to enter this casino without anyone stopping me? The guards never check ID when I enter. Even if they don't check ID, aren't there facial recognition systems with the cameras? I played there for over ten hours without anyone noticing.

What made me angrier was that I called the casino yesterday afternoon at 1 PM to explain the situation. They told me someone would call me back, but after more than two hours, there was no response. I called again around 3 PM and was told the issue had been escalated to the relevant department, and I would receive a call back, but I still haven't heard from anyone.

I feel this casino ignores regulations just to make money, and I will complain to the Liquor and Gamble Organization about this casino.

Text: Monthly meal specials are generally great. Although last month's steak was chewy and they ran out of the red wine only a few days into the deal last month, rather disappointed when we asked to swap with another Red available they refused and only after we bought our own from the bar outside, they compensated us with a discount. The manager really could have done better.
This month's Barramundi meal was delicious and the matching wine was good.

Upon arrival, the security staff checked our IDs: I presented my Colombian driver’s license, which I have always used without issues at clubs, and my friends showed their German IDs. However, we were denied entry because our IDs were deemed invalid. It’s worth mentioning that the day before, we had been allowed entry with the same IDs. When we spoke to the manager, he explained that entry depended on their discretion and was up to their judgment. Unfortunately, we were unable to enter and felt frustrated by the inconsistency in policy enforcement

A very eclectic menu and as someone who travels a lot, so pleased to see creative dishes served for breakfast other than eggs any style.  The gentleman at breakfast was so warm & sweet with my elderly parents as too was Murray. We felt like we were staying with a family host.

Restaurant nice, and would be beautiful to sit outside when warmer (or those who don't feel the cold).

Room was motel style.  Bit small.

Well kitted with Coffee pod machine. LEAF tea....never had thst before.

Our only gripe, the shower ventilation is on same as kitchen so runs while kitchen operates and coykd not sleep till it shut down, too noisy for us, live in country area where it is very peaceful and quiet at night.

Restaurant meal....10/10 for one.

Other:  10/10 entree, 2/10 main...pork belly tough.  I'm sure papaya salad delicious, it certainly looked it..but I didnt realise it's Spicy hot ... one taste and couldn't eat.  Which spoilt my birthday dinner.  Spoke to other diners .... their meals also 10/10. So only the PB and maybe I was just unlucky.

Unfortunately couldn't fit dessert, pilfer potatoes were generous serve(couldn't finish) and filled me up.

We would recommend both the Retreat and restaurant.  And will stay again if there's a good deal going.

Text: As per previous reviews the location is excellent but that’s it these days. Rooms are quite dated although clean. Beds are sagging and could do with replacing as well as the first night we both roasted with a sub-par air conditioning control. Was fine going to bed then we woke around 2am boiling hot - must have a control elsewhere that backs it off to save energy?…. Had to make it 19°c the second night to rest properly.

Tried calling reception twice for questions and nobody was picking up on a quiet Sunday. Had to go down to them to ask in person for a simple shampoo tube - they weren’t busy at all!

Room service food quality was really average and hasn’t changed for a very long time - that was also very disappointing. No mini bar anymore, coffee is only sachets which these days I’d consider poor service on both counts with the Stamford in consideration of price point.
Finally - hidden credit card fees / charges that are extremely HIGH. I got slugged just shy of $10 for 2 nights there!! That’s unforgivably shameful and has no basis for any defence.

Things are not what they used to be and they really need to consider their price point for service and room comfort which has dropped off.

I’ll stay elsewhere next time and happily walk an extra 7-10mins to get where I need.

Text: While the location and convenience to the office were good, I would personally not stay here again. The staff were friendly, but the attention to detail for price paid and service was lacking.

On my first night, the air conditioner was too warm, and even though the temperature was reduced, the temperature remained.  Trying to contact reception by internal number was continually engaged, so I had to dial externally.  The problem did not change, and it was so hot that I was unable to sleep. The next morning, I spoke to reception again, and they advised that they would send someone. When I returned that night, the room was warmer than when I left. Another visit to reception and even though there was a change little changed. There was no follow-up from staff either. For the three nights, there has been limited sleep, which is not acceptable when you need to wake early to work a full day. Unable to reach services through direct phone lines, each attempt and when advised did not receive a response.

The breakfast and room service were good, but for the rating of the hotel, a higher quality was expected. There were also missing items on tap and advised safety bars in the bathroom were not there, which made it difficult for restricted mobility people to use baths.
It's a real shame, but it seems to be the way these days that true service is not available even if you do pay.

Will look at alternatives when have to travel to region again as dollar value did not match return.

Bed was lumpy, soft and uncomfortable. Pillows had minimal shape and body left in them. Bed was 2 singles with bedheads lashed together and looked both dated and uncomfortable.
There was no mini-bar stock, although the minibar menu was there and the water pressure was poor. Only 2 towels provided for 2 people, whereas four would be the expectation of a 5-star hotel and no spare pillows either.
Service staff at reception were nice, however this does not compensate for the poor hard product.

Text: We recently stayed at The Chermside Apartments for 2 nights, but our experience was marred by a disputed $250 charge for allegedly leaving the room in a "messy and dirty state". I dealt with Bryn, who was very unhelpful in his replies. I called to discuss his responses and he claimed the room was "greasy and grimy", which was ridiculous given we only stayed for 2 nights, were out most of the day, and didn't cook in the kitchen.

When I asked to escalate the issue to a manager, Bryn told me to email his manager, Darnelle. However, my emails and calls went unanswered, with excuses that she was "unavailable" or "in meetings". I wondered if she even existed.

Frustrated, I contacted the Office of Fair Trading who conciliated between the The Chermside and myself. Within weeks, I heard from Eleanor at The Chermside, asking for my card details to process a refund. No apology, no acknowledgement of the ordeal. It was a disappointing experience, and I would caution others to carefully document their room condition upon departure and be wary of potential unfair charges.

Poor communication and unhelpful staff made my stay at The Chermside Apartments unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.

Text: I recently stayed at Chermside Apartments, and unfortunately, I cannot recommend it to anyone. My experience was far from pleasant, as I encountered numerous issues that left me thoroughly disappointed.

First and foremost, the service at Chermside Apartments was extremely poor. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, showing little concern for the guests' needs. Their lack of attentiveness and professionalism created a frustrating and unsatisfactory experience.

Moreover, the condition of the room was far from satisfactory. The room had a strong unpleasant odor, which made it difficult to spend any time in there. The cleanliness was also lacking, with visible dirt and dust in various areas. It was evident that the room had not been properly cleaned prior to my arrival, which only added to my discomfort.

In addition to the poor service and uncleanliness, the overall atmosphere of Chermside Apartments was disappointing. The lack of maintenance and care was evident throughout the premises. The common areas appeared neglected and unkempt, contributing to an overall unappealing environment.

Considering the subpar service, the unpleasant odor, and the lack of cleanliness, I cannot recommend Chermside Apartments to anyone seeking a comfortable and enjoyable stay. It fell considerably short of my expectations, and I would advise potential guests to explore other accommodation options in the area.

This is one of the worst places we have ever stayed. We were disgusted. We lasted one night, cut our 4 night stay early and went to Quest Apartments.
The place reeked. Everything was broken- lights flickering. It was incredibly dirty and grimy. The walls were all marked, stained... made you feel horrible. The apartment was directly over a carpark. The kids' bedrooms stunk, and overall, it felt unsafe. We were glad to get out of there. It is not appropriate for families. Do yourselves a favour, and look elsewhere.

When I arrived my room had an awful smell that was unbearable asked to change rooms but apparently they were all booked out.

Parking is a nightmare if you can’t get a park there or on the street you have to park all the way down at McDonalds. The blankets for the bed smelt all musty.

Text: If I could give this pub a negative rating for service I would. We walked to this pub after a lovely night at a comedian. When arriving we got some drinks and went and sat in the back of the smoking area. This was only around 10pm. We then hear a yell from a man at the door saying we have 5 minutes to finish smokes and get back inside. This was a disgusting way to speak to a bunch of ladies I assumed he may of been speaking to a louder bunch closer to the door. Then a few minutes pass by and we are getting yelled at to get back inside the smoking area is closed. Everyone was confused so the staff member continues swearing and says that it’s routine cleaning they do this every night and we need to get out. Half of us had not had any alcohol and were treated so poorly by staff with no respect - For no reason we had only just arrived. I sympathise with staff of a pub as I’m sure they deal with a lot of grumpy drunk people but the way they spoke was shocking to say the least. Disgusting service, awful way to end a night. I will not be returning here and I wouldn’t recommend any one else visit either.

The room has all the basic you could need and was pretty clean but the breakfast was not what we were expecting.... Basically just packed cereals and bread, no fruits or any other facility, besides of the fact that you need to make everything by your own, this is not well explained in the Booking sites.

Text: Went to C’est Bon for dinner. It was a cold night but it was colder inside than outside. As soon as you were taken into the restaurant, it hit you. We raised this with the person who showed us to our table and she responded that the waiters get hot running back and forth. But she adjusted the air conditioning and it made an immediate effect. However, she was right as the waiters soon adjusted the control back to cold. It is extremely rare to see people eating with their puffer jackets on! That’s how cold it was.
The food was excellent! The wait staff not so much. C’est Bon offers share meals and promotes this. They have a share menu. We did not order from the share menu and were quite specific when we ordered we were not sharing. However, We decided to share some oysters to start.  My wife was having the Moreton By Bug Eclair followed by the Qld Beef Tartare and I ordered the Veal Wellington (no entree). For sides we ordered the Fermented Potato Bread and the Roasted Sprouts. Well the wait staff did not translate this too the kitchen.  After downing our oysters, we received the Fermented Potato Bread. Then my wife received her Moreton Bay Bug Eclair. She then received her Qld Beef Tartare. Meanwhile I received nothing. We queried this. This is how it gets served. After my wife finished her meal. We then got the Roasted Sprouts and the Veal Wellington (there were no potatoes as a side). So I had to sit and watch my wife eat and then only after she finished, and we waited, did I receive my main meal. Again, we were not sharing the meal and made it clear upfront. It was so disappointing. And so cold! When it came to dessert, we could not stay any longer it was so cold so we left and went to the ice creamery for dessert (to warm up).
The other thing I found strange was they had a shared menu. But some things on the shared menu was not available on the main menu; for example the gnocchi, Mahi Mahi and the Dry Aged Duck Breast. Again we did not order from the shared menu.
All in all while the food was very good, the service and atmosphere was poor. If you see people eating with their puffer jackets on in a restaurant, it is far too cold. Make sure people want to share their plates as some do not and we made that clear. To wait for my wife to finish her main meal and then she had to watch while I ate mine is unacceptable! This is not a place I would rush back to!

Text: We recently stayed here for the long weekend as we had a few events to attend to in the area.
The service was lovely from all staff we encountered, the park was kept on top top tidy condition, there’s enough to do to keep the kids entertained for our short stay, it was too cold for the pool but the pool area looks absolutely stunning.
The only thing I could fault it on, if I had to would be the playground is a bit run down, but my daughter still loved it either way.
In a great location as it’s only 10-15 minutes to many different attractions / activities.
Will definitely be back

We usually stay on the spacious caravan sites but this time we stayed in a cabin. It was extremely clean and comfortable and equiped with all your basic needs; you simply need food and clothes. Staff are very helpful and Geoff, the owner, went out of his way to assist us in our hour of need.

The owner Geoff is super hands on and often see him round the park making guest feel welcomed and organising amazing events at the village. Reception team are very friendly and great to ask for local hot spots or what’s on. Special mention to Christine, who has always provided top customer service and guest support.  We have stayed in the penthouse suites, Cosmo Cabins and Alfreso. Nice comfy, clean & spacious rooms with a holiday feel. Lots of things to do from mini golf, big pool with heated kids pool that’s got a fun design. Westfield just down the road with delicious restaurants and shopping. Bus stop right outside express to the city. Beautiful wild life can be spotted hanging out at the village too so it’s a great spot for everyone! So much more to say, but highly recommend staying here!

The park is located very near to Westfield Garden City, with many options for take away food and shopping.

There are many different options for on-site cabins, they look really good from outside but I didn't see inside as I stayed in the powered camping area. There is also unpowered camping available.

Came back from dinner around 9:30pm to find Tristeen and a colleague cleaning a new room for us. This definitely wasn't her job and the overtime and extra effort was next level. Of the (literally) thousands of hotels that I have stayed in over the past few decades I can't think of an instance where someone has gone so far to make a difference. I'm humbled and grateful.

When we arrived smell in the room was horrendous. Spoke to reception to see of we could get air freshners or something, all it did was mask it for a very short time.

The rooms were small, there was mould in the shower & bedroom windows.
Curtains ripped, tiles cracked in the bathroom.
Dog hair over the couch and not to mention the smell of the couch & the room. 🤮🤮🤮

The pool however was enjoyable for the kids.

Very close to the motorway, so we were woken numerous times during the night with the noise from the traffic.

We were assured from reception that new management had taken over and they were doing their best to fix issues from previous managers.
Hats off to them, as they have a huge task in front of them.

Text: Month of visit May 2024

It is a nice place to enjoy fish and chips with a view.
The food, however, is nothing spectacular, I think. The chips were just as good as other places.

For me, as an Asian who has a strong and spicy tastebud, I think the fish in the fish and chips were so so so bland! I don’t think they marinated them with anything; they just relied on the lemon that we squeezed and the salt that was given. But maybe it’s just what it is here in Australia.

However, the grilled octopus with plum sauce is the bomb! The octopus was soft, not chewy, which made it difficult to eat. The octopus is also well marinated and the plum sauce is delicious!

Another plus point is that this place is public transport friendly, and located near to the bus stop!

The flathead and cuttlefish we got was nice, the chips are average, if it was a bit more crispy would’ve been better. Generous amount of chicken with the chips and they even provide plenty of salt packets on the side, that’s a bonus!

Be mindful that it can get very windy, our food flew off the table when a strong wind hit us but otherwise, nice food and spot to enjoy your lunch.

We did have the problem with the air conditioning just couldn’t get the room cool enough. Even though it was nice I would want to stop closer to the centre. We spent quite a bit of money in taxis.

Text: The hotel met our needs and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean, but could have a few more upgrades. A few things to know before you book.

Location: The hotel is up on a hill and provides great views of the city, however it is a 10-20 minute walk down hill to the center city and south bank where most of the activity is. The hotel is on the bus line, but if you plan to spend time downtown it might be better to look for closer hotels.

Room: room size was ok, we had 2 double beds and it worked out fine, but there wasn’t a lot of extra space once we got our suitcases open.

The bathroom was very small and the sink was tiny, could not fit a water bottle underneath to fill. There is also very limited counter-space.

The balcony was a nice addition, but no furniture, would be nice if they added a table with a chair.

There was no in room safe, this sounds small, but when you are traveling internationally it is nice to be able to lock up laptops, tablets, and passports while you are out.

Breakfast: the breakfast was pretty straightforward and plain, I have seen much better options at a similar price. We paid $30 per person every morning, I don’t think the selection justified the price. The food was ok no complaints about the quality, but nothing amazing. The challenge here, given the location it would be a 10 min walk to find another place to eat.

The floors were still sticky from a previous stay, the bin hadn't been emptied, cracked basin, mold on the shower. I should point out there's was no management onsite on the weekend we arrived. Instead, my name was on a whiteboard with a room number assigned next to it.. I called the number on the reception door and was told the room is unlocked, the key is inside. Not having any management onsite also leads to those in other rooms having parties and hanging out noisily in the car park. For $240 a night I feel ripped. On the bright side clean linen and bed but let's face it, that's the minimum expectation. Tea and coffee had also not been restocked which also has added to my unfavorable review. Couldn't sleep in because of the birds that seem to have made this place home oh and it's in the flight path of Harrisfield airport a few blocks away. Don't bother with this place.

This restaurant is a longstanding Morningside institution and we used to go to the Friday and Saturday night buffets before Covid before we decided we didn't like the food.  The buffets are finished now and that is a great thing because the food on the a-la-carte menu is really good.  We ordered a Tandoori platter and a couple of vegetarian curries which were excellent and a cut above the average Indian curries which usually taste the same.  We found pieces of cinnamon and cardomom pods in the sauce and the naan were actually cooked in the tandoor oven.  The poppadoms and rice are complimentary too which we really appreciate after paying as much as $5 for a small serve of rice.  BYO is a plus too!

29 April 2017
We've been a few times for the Friday and Saturday night buffet, which at $20 per head is really good value for money.  The curries are too a bit too mild for our taste (more suited to the Australian palate) and we don't think that they are cooking the tandoori chicken and naan in the tandoor oven any more.  We probably won't go back again!

Text: As someone who's been working/staying in different hotels from 3 to 5 stars in Southeast Asia & Australia I can confirm: this is the worst hotel/motel that we've ever stayed in our lives.

When we called the hotel to make a reservation, we asked them about the parking space and whether they have a cot since we have 1 toddler & an infant.

"Yes, we do." was confidently said by the receptionist but what they brought up to our room was a shamelessly, literally broken-to-pieces cot that was only deserved to be thrown into the landfill! To be frank, I would rather that they just have told me that "Nope, we don't." than showing me some thing that was so insultingly miserable!

Not only that, the receptionist promised us on the phone that there'll be a reserved parking space for us. But when we needed to go out they said they won't guarantee that our spot will be still there and the receptionist even said "I've done my job", and "it's not my problem!" In my life have I ever heard anything such unprofessional, I wonder?!

And when we went to the car park, we saw a piece of paper that was written (threatening) that we will be fined for parking in their private car park since we are not staying in their hotel!? By this stage, we're just lost for words.

Not only that, on the second day of stay I asked the receptionist to send a housekeeper to clean our room while we've been out. But when I checked the room, it was the same sheet, and the floor, the carpet, the balcony were still under a thick layer of dust and dirt. The sheet even had the same dirt marks as when we just checked in.

I was also so nervous to use the supposed-to-be new fresh towels that they replaced because I was worried that it may be the old ones from other rooms. They're smelled like toilet spray.

And the last but not least worry was the long vertical blind chains of the window. It indubitably is a hazard for children for they might hang themselves with it. I didn't dare to take my eyes off our toddler for a second. It's added more stress in this already disarranged stay.

This is still a potentially propitious place to stay if you want to experience some rollercoaster of emotions and enjoy getting high on adrenalin rush from being stressed or already get used to slump standard of living conditions though.

To us, may the Lord save us from staying in somewhere like this the second time ever, Amen.

Text: We love Pepe's because it's just straightforward good Mexican food. We love the chili con carne as a side to anything we order! People always go for the burritos and the enchiladas but in my opinion the empanadas are a quiet winner. They are cooked well and very flavourful - I always order guacamole and sour cream on the side as well. The salad in the empanadas is perfect to cut the richness in between bites.

Dinners can be very busy so if you can, try to go for lunchtime, which is so much quieter.

Shoutout to the lady server who recommended we get the Guava Jarritos - it was perfect with our meal.

Text: The food is amazing and I frequently visit this restaurant. Service, food quality and the overall seating arrangement is all too good!
Preparation of dishes is awesome and tasty, with portions good enough for one and can be shared as well.
This Mexican joint is something different from normal Mexican restaurant.
I am writing this review after more than 2 yrs of regular visits.
Every time I chose to go I enjoy the cuisine.
BUT, recently the portions are getting smaller while there is price increase. I guess with the prices being increases the management should go back to same portions and not reduce the quantity.

Upon arrival they had one of our dishes as a Tikka Masala instead of Vindaloo. Had to wait another 20min. Super bland madras and vindaloo. The hot vindaloo was not spicy at all. Thin sauce for both. Saffron rice tastes and looks like it has no spices in it. The vegetable samosa was nice. This was my first time trying this restaurant and I won’t be back!

In the end we stuck with the menu and she gave us good suggestions. The food was served very quickly, and was very tasty and enjoyable. The one dish that was suggested was goat. As we have never tried goat before we took her up on her suggestion. Didn't rate it. Everything else was excellent.

Although it is a small venue at the back of the small shopping centre, we found a gem of Indian flavours. It was a balance of spices and seasonings and full of flavour. Then aromatics of the chicken tandoor, creamy curries, with every bite being a delight for the senses. The menu offered a wide variety of options across the Indian flavour range. The chef special goat curry was absolutely scrumptious.

The staff ensured that our dining experience was enjoyable, from offering recommendations on dishes to promptly refilling drinks.

Overall, our first visit to Namaste Indian at Eatons Hill was a five-star flavour experience. I cannot wait to return and try more of their dishes. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an amazing Indian flavoured experience.

Text: Review is for takeaway order.
Portions were great for the price, specials were very good, and food all arrived quickly. In terms of taste overall, food was okay but wouldn’t be my first pick next time.
We specifically wanted a Pad See Ew, and Thai at Home had this and Pad Thai on special!
Ordered Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Keaw Tod (fried wonton), Tamarind Prawn, and Som Tum Pu Pla.
Wonton: Excellent. These were so good!!
Fried noodles: generous portions, really packed into the container. Could use more add ins. I upgraded $8 for Seafood, which was two prawns, three calamari curls, and a scallop; the veg was minimal and the flavour was quite mild.
Tamarind Prawn: Six big juicy prawns, but it was a bit stodgy and you couldn’t really taste the tamarind.
Som Tum Pu Pla: The menu description for this could be revised. It said green pawpaw salad with “salted crab” which we took to mean soft shell crab; but it turns out this is a raw crab pickled in brine with the hard shell on. A very traditional street dish; and definitely not what we expected!! Couldn’t eat the crab. Too much sauce, it was served warm, and the salty brackish flavour ruined the pawpaw for us. I’ll bet someone out there loves this dish.

The Tom yum soup was really tasty with strong lemon grass flavours (on the sweeter side).
The spicy thai fried rice was my favourite dish. The dish resonated with the spice from the chili oil and depth of the fennel.
The pad thai wasn't the best I've ever had, but a solid effort. The ingredients were fresh and good but maybe a little less flavour than I was expecting.
Will definitely be going back.

Text: HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Always dine in though!! The dine in food is exceptional Indian cuisine and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing curry. I cannot say a bad thing about their dine in food as it has been consistent and exceptionally fantastic. The service is also very good with the waitress being extremely polite. Please consider the dine in food is quite different to  the takeaway/delivery experience. We have eaten here a lot over the last few months and can safely say that dining in is the only way to eat this food. I've read reviews about their delivery service and I can tell you they are not wrong. We ordered delivery and they had forgotten some of our order but thankfully we live close enough that it wasn't too much of an inconvenience. They did give us a free can of coke which was a nice gesture.  We've had takeaway and whilst it is still good food it is a 'watered' down version of their dine in curries and their naans are never as fresh and can sometimes be overly chewy. It did also take just over an hour for the food to be delivered. I do not want to deter anyone too much from getting takeaway from here but I would advise that if you are after the proper food experience you should dine in. Dine in 5/5 - Takeaway 3.5/5 - Delivery 2/5

Text: Good service with friendly staff and quick meals. However both curries were very sweet (they shouldn't have been sweet at all), almost disgustingly so. I don't understand why they feel the need to dump so much sugar in at some of these restaurants. It's not authentic and tastes horrible. Behind the sweetness the flavours were quite nice.

Text: Will never go back. Worst service. The waitress was so rude. We went around their lunch break time, and she kept coming back to our table every 2 minutes to say "the restaurant is closing soon" as soon as our dish arrived. We tried to order more naan but she refused and said the kitchen is closed now. Then she started cleaning our dishes before even asking if we were done. This all happened less than 20 minutes of sitting down. We just wanted to leave at that point so we paid and was leaving, and she yelled at our back saying "Wait! Is the card approved?" and held us at the door as if we would run off without paying for 20 something dollar lunch. Such a shame, used to go here all the time and recommended this place to friends, would never be back after this horrible experience and I recommend you do the same.

Our recent day trip escape to Tambourine Mountain provided a delightful immersion in nature's tranquility. The scenic drive offered breathtaking views and captivating glimpses of local wildlife, including unique sticky tree frogs & native Honey Bees. As we ascended the mountain, we were continually awestruck by the ever-changing panorama.

Upon reaching the summit, we concluded our scenic drive and then found ourselves at the welcoming Tambourine Restaurant- at the Bearded Dragon Hotel - for a late lunch & rest. The establishment's friendly and attentive staff warmly greeted us with smiles. The spacious dining area, with its disability & wheelchair accessible design and comfortable ambiance, featured a crackling fireplace that exuded a sense of rustic charm.

The establishment also offers the opportunity to interact with adorable animals, with a delightful selection of furry friends available for guests to visit. For a nominal fee, ($2) visitors can even purchase animal feed, adding a touch of whimsy to the experience. This delightful encounter served as a perfect culmination to our rejuvenating day trip.

We can not wait to come back & stay for longer next time.

We highly recommend Tambourine Restaurant at the Bearded Dragon Hotel to anyone seeking a refreshing escape near the Gold Coast. The combination of stunning scenery, a delicious, perfectly cooked, well portioned meal, beautiful animals to spend time with and a charming atmosphere ensures a truly memorable experience.

They provide their meal enough for one person, good amount of quantity. We went 5 people and we couldn’t finish everything so we bought back our food in containers. Their fish is awesome 🤩 atmosphere is ok if you’re sitting inside though outside is better. Service is fine. Overall I would recommend this place

Text: EXCEPTIONAL. After hearing nothing but rave reviews from friends about Lefkas Taverna, we booked in for lunch on Saturday. The whole dining experience was nothing short of perfect. The vibes were great, the staff were attentive but not intrusive and as far to say as warm. They were just a delight on every interaction. With Greek cuisine being my favourite, I was exceptionally excited to visit Lefkas. And was not let down at all. The menu is diverse and the food was incredible! The zucchini and feta balls, dang! So so good! We had about 7 dishes and they were all incredible. Excited at the thought of returning. True, genuine, high quality Greek food for the win.

Thank you so much :)

The cutlets, halloumi, lemon potatoes - cooked to perfection! The Ouzo was a lovely way to finish it off 🧡 Also the outside heating was perfection on a cold winters night.

The young man there always makes us feel welcome and picks out the biggest pieces of pork belly for me. Today they were selling home-made cupcakes as well which were phenomenal! The cupcakes were better than anything you'd get from a bakery and their fried meats are better quality and value than any restaurant. If you haven't been there before I heartily recommend them!

Text: We enjoyed a memorable banquet dinner at Libertine last night.
We had a small hiccup with the banquet and dietary restrictions, as everyone was expected to have the same dishes. Initially, this was disappointing, but Merri, our server, went out of her way to accommodate our needs and made sure we were satisfied.
The dishes were generally delicious, though some, like the barramundi, leaned a bit on the sweeter side, which was unexpected. The portions were generous, and the presentation was impressive. The creme brule was a real standout.
The pacing was a bit uneven, with the first four courses arriving quickly, followed by a long wait before the last three, likely due to a busy night.
Surprisingly sitting outside in winter was pleasant, as the outdoor heaters kept us warm despite the chilly weather.
All in all, it was a great evening with good food, attentive service, and a cozy atmosphere.

We tried the smoked Burrata, which was beautifully fresh, the seared pork belly, which was extremely flavorful, and the light, fluffy gnocchi with perfectly balanced Gorgonzola cream. We also ordered the freshly made focaccia bread for an additional $2.00 per slice, and every bite was worth it, from the texture to the flavor. The service was outstanding.

The lush, inviting atmosphere immediately set the tone for a relaxing meal. I started with the cured meats board, which featured a delicious variety of textures and flavors, perfectly paired with some pickled jalapenos.

My medium-rare eye filet was cooked to perfection—tender and juicy, with a side of crispy, flavorful potatoes. The attention to detail in each dish was clear.

From the moment we stepped into the warmly lit, inviting ambiance of the restaurant, it was clear that we were in for a treat. The food, an exquisite blend of flavors and textures, was absolutely delicious, satisfying both the eye and the palate with its presentation and taste.

What set Cloudland apart was not just the quality of its cuisine but the exceptional customer service that accompanied it. Understanding my need to drive later, the staff offered us specially crafted mocktails, which were both thoughtful and indicative of the restaurant's commitment to customer care and safety. These delightful beverages were a perfect complement to the meal, enhancing the dining experience with their refreshing flavors.

The staff at Cloudland were the epitome of friendliness and professionalism. Each member of the team we interacted with was attentive, making us feel genuinely welcomed and valued as guests. Their recommendations were spot on, guiding us through the menu with expert knowledge and enthusiasm.

One of the standout dishes of the evening was undoubtedly the pizza. It was a masterpiece of culinary skill, boasting a perfect crust, expertly balanced toppings, and a flavor that danced on the tongue. It was clear that great care had been taken in its preparation, showcasing the kitchen's commitment to quality and flavor.

In summary, Cloudland is highly recommendable for anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience. The combination of delicious food, excellent customer service, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit destination. Whether you're in the mood for a gourmet pizza or simply looking to enjoy a night out with thoughtfully crafted mocktails, Cloudland promises to exceed expectations and leave you eagerly anticipating your next visit.

The menu is varied and the dishes are done well, I wouldn’t say its value is centred around the skill of the meals but the food was elevated and there were no complaints. The Arancini and Calamari were both delicious, the pizza had a great base and delicious topping, the pasta was incredible and fresh, and the steak was good for its price point. The prices are also pretty good, including the drinks with cocktails for $22 and wine starting around $50 a bottle. The cocktails did let us down a little, but that was made up for by some incredible shots we got at the end. Finally, the service was 5 star and shout out to our amazing server Bianca who went above and beyond to make our night fun! The venue is also absolutely beautiful, and they are connected to a rooftop pub to carry on your drinks afterwards.

We recently stayed at The Inchcolm Hotel, a delightful 4-star dog-friendly hotel located in the heart of Brisbane's CBD. It was an exceptional experience from start to finish.

From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the building's stunning architecture and sophisticated blend of historic and modern styles, which added an extra touch of elegance to our stay. The warm and welcoming atmosphere extended to our furry friend as well. The hotel provided a thoughtful welcome pack for our dog, including treats, a toy, food, water, and a very comfortable bed and blanket – truly making it feel like a home away from home for our pup.

The customer service at The Inchcolm Hotel was exceptional, with the staff going above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. Our spacious and well-appointed room featured a separate living area that allowed us to unwind in comfort and style.

We were delighted with every aspect of our stay and highly recommend The Inchcolm Hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious, pet-friendly experience in Brisbane. Thank you for a wonderful stay – we can't wait to return!

Text: The Inchcolm is an incredibly beautiful venue that I am so happy to have booked for my wedding. We booked the entire hotel and so had a lot of the wedding guests staying in the hotel and they treated everyone with the same care. They left champagne not only in the bridal suite but in the rooms of the wedding party too.

The staff were incredible - with huge shout outs to Sally (events manager) Daniel (manager) and Ally (bartender). Noone went without food or waited too long at the bar. They took care of everything wonderfully and I was not stressed in the slightest on the day. Ally even did a twist on a cocktail for me and they were just so delicious. When one bartender made a cocktail, they made sure to get someone else in the bar so people weren't waiting forever.

The only hitches to me were the PA and the way the music sounded, and the art work not being there. I unfortunately didn't get to hear (meaning noone did) the lyrics to the songs of the first dance and father daughter dance, and as the Hotel had just been sold there were a bunch of wall art that went with it. I know this isn't really the fault of the venue, but I wasn't kept abreast of that information until it was done.

Overall The Inchcolm was a gorgeous venue with so many beautiful places for photos. It is eclectic and fun, really being just a bit different which is totally my vibe. Would highly recommend not only having an event here, but staying as a guest. Everyone commented on just how special the venue was.

From the balcony your view is directly out to the river and the Story Bridge.

The food was tasty and there was great selection of vegetarian/vegan and meat finger food options, and the private bar was fantastic. The staff were friendly and moved around the guests well with the food. The person behind the bar was friendly and had a good knowledge of wines, etc, that were being offered. By the time the party had finished the main area of Friday's had music playing and people dancing.

There are many ways to cook

There are Singaporean, Malaysian, Vietnamese and Chinese cuisines
Very diverse flavors

And different member meals are launched every month

However, the quality is sometimes unstable.
If the food is fried

Fat Noodle performed perfectly
But if the food is fried
Meals can sometimes be a bit cold

But so far, I think the membership meals they launch every month are quite delicious.

It is recommended to apply for a membership card at Casino

Then you can enjoy discounts at restaurants
It is also recommended to make a reservation in advance

Otherwise too many gamblers will stay at the Casino

Just feedback… maybe make your offer clearer that if you order online you don’t get a free garlic. Happy to support local but at the same time I want my moneys worth as we spend over $65 when ordering.

Text: These are the best pizzas in the greater Brisbane area. Do yourself a huge favour and go to La Madrina for your pizzas. Quality ingredients and made with love. Consistently mouth watering pizzas and have been for many years. Impeccably clean and friendly professional service. As I said, the best pizzas in the greater Brisbane region and the best pizza I have eaten.

Text: We recently ordered the family-sized "Outback" pizza from La Madrina and wanted to share our experience. Firstly, the pizza is generously sized, making it a good choice for family or group dining. The price, at $31, may seem a bit on the higher side, but it's justified by the ample portions and the liberal amount of toppings they use. It's always great to see a pizza that doesn't skimp on the good stuff!

The toppings were fresh, flavorful, and well-distributed, providing a delightful mix in every bite. However, there was one aspect that kept the pizza from being perfect - the scarcity of pizza sauce. The almost absent sauce was noticeable and slightly impacted the overall taste and moisture of the pizza.

In summary, if you're in Victoria Point and craving a hearty, topping-rich pizza, La Madrina's "Outback" is definitely worth trying. Just a small suggestion for the restaurant - a bit more sauce could elevate this already fantastic pizza to new heights!

Text: Awesome pizza but for some reason they never answer the phones on a Friday night, not the first time I’ve had this issue….
Called multiple times no answer….
Pretty disappointed as we are otherwise regular customers and enjoy the quality of the food….

Text: I have always enjoyed the pizza...never disappointed,  5 stars for pizza. But tonight I thought I'd try some pasta, carbonara. It was very average in flavour, the take away container was half full and cost me $18.95. At least give me a full container with a bit more flavour for that price . Quite a let down!!

Text: The vibe at Alfred and Constance is unique, set in a beautiful old Queenslander, it’s quite casual but fun. There’s plenty of dining areas both inside and out. Staff have always been friendly. Have always enjoyed my time and food here, unfortunately just never seem to enjoy the cocktails too much.

Text: Had lunch on the cafe side which has ready-to-eat food like paninis and salads (I think the other side is made-to-order). Meredith's Apricot Chicken is absolutely delicious and their salad selections offer more than your regular side salad. Great ambience and lovely, friendly staff.

Text: The best chips in Brisbane, oh my word they are superb. Paired with Alfie's cheese burger, the serving is extremely generous and filling.
Sauces are excellent, though the burger lacks much taste.

Text: Amazing little bar in valley, usually our teams go to place for after work drinks catchup

Amazing staff, I don’t personally drink alcohol but they’ve got good selection of soft drinks and good coffee too

Good snack options too, one of the team member raves about their burgers too

Good spot for grabbing a drink on the way back to home

Nice ambiance with lots of antiques to see in the bar, there is a small kiosk coffee as well for quick coffee

Text: Great place! Had to wait a bit long for the food though despite early morning with very few guests.
Both dishes were very tasty.
Garlic Prawn & Scallop Linguini was a bit mild but very pleasant taste overall. The cherry tomatoes were excellent, super juicy and was bursting in my mouth.
The other dish was Shakshuka. First time trying it but was really impressed with the flavour from the spices used. However we wish the flatbread was grilled a bit more thorough.

Text: The pulled pork tacos OMG they were so good… who thought to pack everything in a roti because they were onto something real good. Super flavourful, great portion sizes if not a little more than you’re paying for. We also tried the donuts which were incredibly chocolatey and sweet, could only have one at most but perfect for those who have a sweet tooth. Chai latte was one of those deconstructed ones lol

Text: Gorgeous place, coffee was delightful, food was also good. Even though it was busy we were seated pretty promptly. But experience marred because of our very odd waiter. He asked if we were OK then said he's too busy when we started ordering, when he took our order after practically having to force it on him he stood like a mile away so I had to yell my order over all the noise of the cafe. Thinking back I don't know whether to laugh or frown, felt like a prank.

Text: First time visitor to this venue and it was a good experience. Food is a little different, menu is very diverse and offers a slightly different offering to what you would expect, such as using Roti’s for tacos tortillas. Service was excellent and fast.

Text: It is also a night owl convenience store. The service is always very decent. They aren't pushy, but offering upselling is part of the job. You have to accept these places get mystery shopped and there are penalties to the employee if this is not being done.

Text: Very expensive petrol here. Just paid $1.58 a litre. Also been overcharged twice for packs of ice blocks which are icy inside .  Freezers don't seem to work properly.  Not a patch on what used to be a great local store as well  as petrol station. Better off going to Woolies for food and it's not hard to find cheaper petrol.

Text: Decided to try this cafe for a breakfast. It is located just on one of the entries to the shopping centre. I strolled up to the counter to look at the menu. I was greeted by a friendly staff member who then took my order. It was early and there was plenty of seating to choose from both inside and out. I ordered scrambled eggs on toast, which is served on lovely thick toast. Eggs were pretty good. Also ordered a flat white which was also nice and hot, with a good flavour. Lots of choices for both breakfast and lunch.

Text: I have been here a few times and bought clients who I take out and not had a too bad experience, however today was different. The staff were miserable behind the counter. I ordered the vegetarian  breakfast and told them that I don't eat bread would they be able to take it off and put something else. Immediately it was "no, we can't swap for another item", I would need to pay for it. I also ordered a piccolo,which was a teaspoon of coffee and the rest milk and froth! Nothing like anywhere else, when the food arrived I was so disgusted! On the plate was about 10 wilted spinach leaves with one cut up cooked mushroom on top,one very small poached egg, the smallest tomato they could of found, cut in half and cooked, all for $16.90!! What a rip off! Because I was quite hungry I ate it, i should of sent  it back and got a refund.. The older lady who was will me was also disgusted at the portion size, she was going to order a cake but saw how small the cake slices were!
When the owner/ manager collected the empty plate and asked how it was, as soon as I started talking he rudely interrupted. I told him that it certainly wasn't worth the money and for that reason I wouldn't be back, all he could say was that was fine and he was sorry I felt that way! The lady I was with told me that she didn't ever want to return. I looked around and noticed it was mainly pensioners in the cafe. I really hope you as the manager/ owner feels happy ripping old people and the public off, with your extremely small portions and high prices! If this was a Cafe in Europe you would be boycotted and go out of business, and so you should! Disgraceful place! Go elsewhere people where your money goes much further and they care about their customers!

Text: Relaxed atmosphere with staff who have always been tremendously attentive to Cafe guests. It's more like visiting old friends than going to a Cafe. Very enjoyable, and they always interact well with children and oldies alike.

Food is priced very well, and you get the bonus of kind staff and good vibes for free.

Highly recommended.

Text: I am a customer and have tried uno caffe multiple times and well being at the caffe I have and witnessed on several occasions the bosses treating staff with disrespect. This behaviour made me feel uncomfortable and as though staff are not treated fairly or with respect. Recently I went their with my partner to order food and the food was nice and coffee was amazing and the staff there are lovely but they are not treated right, I will not be returning to this cafe as it makes me feel uncomfortable.Although  girls that work their are lovely, and make the place feel welcome I just  that stuff are treated unfair

Text: I have been here only once for the Whiskey Expo 2019. It was one of the worst places to hold such an otherwise joyful event. The air conditions were off. A few guests went to the club staff to complain. They weren't on until the end of the event. The staff at the bar whose only task was to serve lunch packs couldn't have been less unfriendly.
On the positive side, the bathrooms were clean though.
