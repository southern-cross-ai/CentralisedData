Text: Super stay. Great location next to the beach and near to a convenience store, cafes and good restaurants. Friendly staff. Car park a big bonus. Rooms clean and comfortable.

The city twins are on the second floor and overlook the car park. There's just a little bit of noise from bathroom plumbing coming from other rooms especially in the night and the cleaners wheeling the bins around in the car park at 630am! Also watch out for the very hot water from the bathroom taps.

Text: Parking free under the building (small tight spots), friendly reception staff. We stayed on the 4th floor, bathroom seemed to have been recently refurbished and nice. Bed wasn‚Äôt the best, and furniture in the room a bit dated. Mini bar reasonably priced, tea/coffee/biscuits in the room, TV & foxtel. Views - spectacular! Bring binoculars - we saw several whales breech far out in the ocean which was exciting. Buffet breakfast was varied and tasty, again, amazing views! Walked to the end of the street for dinner at Sticky Rice Thai (yum!) and other restaurants close by. Would definitely stay at Noah‚Äôs again, we have a great time!

Text: As my wife & I were attending an event in Newcastle on the Saturday, we decided to stay overnight & booked in to Noah's on the beach. Although it was only one night, I would have no hesitation in staying there again & recommending Noah's to anyone looking for accommodation in the heart of Newcastle. The friendly staff @ reception made it easy to check in & the upgrade to an ocean view room was much appreciated after a long day to just relax & watch the waves roll in.

Text: We stayed at Noah's over the weekend. It was $500 for the 2 night for a room with a queen and a single  on the harbour side not the beach side. If you are on a high enough level (we were on 5) The harbour side is more interesting to look at at night, lots of city lights and big ships coming in to the port. The beach side would have nice views during the day but be pretty dark at night. There are slightly cheaper rooms but you are lower down and look at the parking lot. Really good location to walk around that end of Hunter St. We enjoyed our stay, would have been nice to have a microwave. Oh and they have actual cable, all the good channels which was fantastic!

The prime minister was there too so that was fun, my son went down and shook his hand.

My only criticism is that there is only one guest washer and dryer, it took me hours going up and down the lift seeing if the machines were available. If they added even one more of each it might help.

Text: Fern bay motel was located opposite to the river and was a clean decent motel.
Rooms were big and spacious and had a refrigerator, microwave, kettle, tea coffee biscuits, iron with board and a toaster.

The room we stayed was a family room with two double beds and 1 single bed. The single bed was just under the TV which was a little odd to place rest the rooms were quite clean and well thought off.

There is an outdoor seating but since it was quite cold so we could not use that.

The owner called us since we were checkin in late so she helped in getting in without issues.

The only issue was that there was no cutlery to use for our breakfast and dinner and the person at the reception was a bit rude when asked for it. Also we arrived late sat evening so we asked if the room could be cleaned on sunday afternoon as kids do make it a little messy and we would like to change towels and bedsheets and the receptionist refused straight away saying we don‚Äôt clean rooms on sunday and monday.

I am concerned here that if someone leaves the motel on sunday then how do they get the room cleaned for next guest.

It‚Äôs a little far from anna bay but in a peaceful location.

Text: We are two 21-year-old girls who stayed at this hotel for one night. The bar and pizza place downstairs were great and the room and bathrooms were reasonable for the price we payed (although the showers had a habit of going from boiling to freezing to boiling again‚Ä¶.). The main downside to our stay was how unsafe we felt. The other guests were loud and left their doors open all day and night, playing music and making loud comments when we would walk past (which we had to do get to the stairs and bathrooms). They even came to our door and pretended to be room service. We felt that the staff should have better monitored their guests and at the very least ask them to keep their doors shut and the noise levels down. We understand that the hotel cannot control how guests act but we felt that no steps were taken to ensure the space was welcoming and safe for everyone. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying here for more than one night, especially as a young woman.

When I explained I no longer wanted my sub anymore (because I couldn't have fresh or toasted bread) I was treated as if I'd kicked the lady's dog.

We were ultra casual after a walk around Honeysuckle but we were served with professionalism at every turn.

I highly recommend the tempura prawns, they were delightful and the sweet and sticky dipping sauce was just as nice.

Highly recommend a visit and will definitely return on our next visit to Newcastle!

My mum had the chicken schnitzel she really enjoyed it. My friend had the Viking cutlet because they where sold out of the Scotch fillet. It had a nice flavour to it.

Text: Hi,

This place is not what you'd expect. The food is respectable but not great, the serving sizes are small and format for eating is a bit odd. Gazetted 1.5hr slots to eat and go. We were only there an hour anyway. I emailed to offer to provide some private feedback but to date they have not responded.

Pork belly, dry. And ok.
Squid - pub feed quality, sufficient
Cauliflower entree, not good.
Meal sizes are very small, eat before going there.

Overall, the cost makes it a little rough to stomach. Waitstaff were ok, but not what you'd expect in an expensive restaurant.

The experience left me wanting, more food, and better service.

Thanks.

We would eat there at least once a week.

Unfortunately, they discontinued this menu in favor of traditional "pub food" and we have not been back since.  We can get pub food anywhere, and not have to deal with finding parking on Darby Street.  Not interested in returning until the menu is more original again.

They give the least about of lettuce and even counted 6 shredded pieces of carrot before asking for more to be added. I would suggest a bit more care taken when cutting the bread as a lot of times i feel like the bread is mangled after and squash the bread down flat.

From the moment we booked the venue, Chris, the function manager, was incredibly accommodating and attentive to our needs. He went above and beyond to ensure every detail was taken care of, making the planning process smooth and stress-free. His dedication and genuine care made us feel confident that our special day was in good hands.
The bar staff at The Kent were outstanding! Not only were they efficient and professional, but they were also incredibly friendly and welcoming. They made sure our guests were well taken care of and went out of their way to accommodate any special requests. Their warm and friendly demeanor added a delightful atmosphere to our reception, and many of our guests commented on their excellent service. The food was amazing, and the kitchen brought the food out in a timely manner.
We also decided to hire the in-house DJ provided by The Kent, and we were thrilled with his work. He did an amazing job of keeping the dance floor alive and playing a great mix of music that kept everyone entertained throughout the night. He was attentive to our song preferences and was able to read the crowd perfectly, ensuring that everyone had a fantastic time.
The recently renovated venue was lovely, and was perfect for our intimate wedding reception. The facilities were clean and well-maintained, and the staff took great care to ensure that everything ran smoothly on the day.
Overall, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better venue for our wedding reception. The combination of the friendly and accommodating staff, excellent service, and attention to detail made our day truly memorable. We highly recommend The Kent to anyone looking for a venue for their event. Thank you to Chris, the bar staff, the kitchen staff, and the DJ for making our day perfect!

The mushroom steaks were sensational, as were the corn ribs. The noodles in the salad were a bit hard like they should have been cooked a little longer and the artichoke tasted a bit too vinegary, so I assume it was the type from the jar in vinegar, a rinse should do the trick to remove a bit more of it and it would have been a great dish. All up we were impressed by the creativity of the menu and the effort to make sure vegans are catered for. We will be back!

Text: I have been to Rustica a number of times and usually walked away happy and satisfied factoring the cost of visiting the restaurant. Unfortunately, my last experience did not meet my previous experiences . The service was pretty ordinary ( slow and more take away cafe like) and the food for such a highly rated restaurant did not meet the high standards of what I had previously experienced at Rustica. The atmosphere was nice sitting by the window, however, the service and meals were a little disappointing in quality and flavour. Spending $400 for 4 people I did expect better or on par to my previous visits, it was a notable difference. Maybe it was just an off night for them.... maybe a slip in standards. I'll  give them another go and the benefit of doubt.

I always complain that wines are too expensive but at least the wine list has a range of different wines which I am happy to spend a little more on. A few more options by the glass would be nice but you should be able to choose one.
The staff a busy, possibly a little to busy to give a little more interaction with the customers. Hats off to the young lady who served us. Knew the entire menu as well as the wine list. Very impressive.

Went in to inform the manager that they were putting out cold food and she couldn‚Äôt care less, I‚Äôve seen kids managing in McDonald‚Äôs that are more productive than this women.

Also, I had to take pictures to demonstrate because I can‚Äôt stress enough how disappointing this is: the singular beef patty they DID put on my burger was suuuper thin. Less than 1cm thick, couldn‚Äôt even taste it in there past all the sauce. Never eating here again üíÄ

The young girl behind the counter said there was going to be another 10 minute wait for a grilled chicken sandwich but they had fried ones ready. That would have been 30 minutes to get two sandwiches. Absolutely disgusted with the service and wait time.

Nestled away in a charming side street, the cozy atmosphere of this restaurant is the perfect place to unwind and enjoy a meal. However, due to its popularity, it's highly recommended to make a booking in advance. The food is as beautiful as it is delicious, with the goat curry being a standout dish that's sure to satisfy. The mango lassi was also delicious.This family-run restaurant has been a local favorite for years, and it's easy to see why. Although prices may be on the higher side ($$), the quality of the food and service make it worth it. Keep in mind that finding parking in the area can be a bit challenging, so plan ahead accordingly. Overall, we highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for an unforgettable Indian food dining experience in Newcastle.

The roasted beetroot and sweet potato salad had no sweet potato but carrots, but the taste was alright though the beetroots were too sour. The other dishes were scrumptious and beautifully made. Their house wines were lovely as well. Tks to the bistro staff who were very friendly and helpful. Will go back in the near future but will never try their pork loin chop again.

I paid extra to upgrade the chicken in one box to one of the new Sweet and Sour Crunch pieces, and instead recieved a regular piece (a sad looking wing piece which was almost entirely bone).

Both drinks were warm on arrival. The delivery only took 5 minutes, so the only explanation is that the drinks weren't refrigerated at all prior to being sent out.

Even the chips were worse than usual.

I've been buying from this store for years, but in the last few months they've been getting worse and worse. The staff clearly just don't care at all. I won't be going back, and I recommend that anybody who values their money stays as far away as possible.

Text: Cold Wings and Chilly Reception: A Drive-Thru Disaster at Waratah Red Rooster

In the fast-paced world of drive-thrus, we often sacrifice a bit of quality for the convenience of quick service. However, my recent visit to Waratah Red Rooster took that sacrifice to a whole new level ‚Äì and not in a good way.

As I eagerly unwrapped my chilli aioli Ripper box, I was met with a chilling surprise: two wings that seemed to have been transported straight from the freezer to my car. Despite the sizzling exterior, It was like biting into an Arctic adventure, with the outside sizzling hot and the inside colder than my ex's heart. It was a disappointment of Antarctic proportions.

What's even more concerning than my own culinary letdown is the thought of someone else biting into these frostbitten wings and unknowingly risking their health. Raw chicken is no joke ‚Äì it's a recipe for salmonella poisoning and a stomachache that'll make you wish you'd stuck to a PB&J sandwich.

While I didn't have the chance to confront the staff face-to-face, I can't help but wonder if they're aware of the risk they're putting their customers in. It's one thing to serve up subpar food, but it's another thing entirely to jeopardize someone's health in the process.

So, if you're considering a visit to Waratah Red Rooster, I urge you to think twice ‚Äì not just for the sake of your taste buds, but for the sake of your stomach. As for me, I'll be steering clear of this drive-thru disaster zone and sticking to restaurants that prioritize both speed and safety.

Sadly, the food was incredibly ordinary, overcooked & very dry chicken, salad drowning in dressing, and croutons were so stale they were actually chewy.   For a large venue marketed towards families (they have a nice under cover play area), they apparently have only 2 high chairs, so we struggled to feed our baby while sitting on our laps until another family finished eating and could give up the chair they were using. I'll finish by saying the staff were lovely, however, and did what they could to assist.

The spicy chicken rolls sadly had overcooked and dry chicken, which made them chewy. There was a limited selection right at noon, more of a variety was expected since the lunch rush would have been starting soon. On the positive side, the sushi was not over-riced, and that was nice. The prices were high for just okay sushi. I did not hate it, but I would not return on purpose.

Text: The bibimbap‚Äôs are amazing, taste great and super good value for money and I will continue to buy these quite regularly. Unfortunately,  the same can‚Äôt be said for the sushi, I have purchased different types of sushi from here on different times of the day but I have finally given up on trying to give them the benefit of the doubt as it is consistently bad!! The rice is always hard and inedible. Compared to the local competitors it is priced at a slightly hirer price and the portions signally are less. The staff however are very welcoming and friendly and I will definitely keep coming back for the bibimbap!

Text: Very first time in Newcastle, and we just had to check out one of the best Italian Restaurants. The overall ambiance was very welcoming and vibrant. Photos do not do this place justice (go experience this for yourself). I will say, at the very beginning we were asked ( Still or Sparkling Water) to we replied with, Sparkling ( know that at the end of our night we were charged without knowing $5 for that bottle of Sparkling water).

The lady and gentlemen that served our table were so extraordinary with their service and how they handled and engaged with the children. The food is always amazing here! One of my favourite places to eat when passing by through Newcastle

Text: My wife and I had the distinct pleasure of dining at The Basement on New Year's Eve. We had been eager to try their menu for a while and were thrilled to get a booking to see out 2023 on a high. We were not disappointed. We arrived 15 minutes early but our host gladly found us a table. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful, explaining the menu and making suggestions when required. Even when not waiting on us, they would acknowledge us with a smile and generally made us feel welcome and catered for. For the entire 2 hours we were there and considering how busy it was, they never made us feel rushed to 'eat, drink and go'

As for the food and the accompanying wine choices, they were top-notch. The food was beautifully plated and delicious. The portion sizes were perfect and we left completely satisfied. We will definitely be back. Bravo!

Ruined my day so early with burnt yet weak flavourless coffee and could not even eat my sandwich it was so burnt. If I could rate 0 star I would.
Used to be my go to spot now turned to garbage! Waste of money and time.

Text: We were really looking forward to eating here on our last night in Newcastle, but what a disappointment beyond words. The young guy serving us was so casual, he seemed disinterested. I ordered the Rosina's special pizza. It arrived undercooked - the mushrooms were raw, the cheese hadn't melted, the ham and prawns were cold. I informed the 'waiter' who shoved it back in the oven without a word spoken! Then it arrived again and yes it was hotter in the middle this time, but now with a black charcoal crust. Again no word came from the waiter as it landed on our table! We explained we couldn't eat it because it was burnt, but he told us it was now cooked!! We asked for another one to be made and it eventually emerged and actually tasted delicious. What a shame it couldn't be achieved first time round. Poor service and rubbish experience. Would not return.

Text: Ordered a margarita pizza to take away. They have not updated the prices on the board as they have gone up. The pizza did not have a single tomato piece or even any tomato sauce, just herbs and cheese and probably should have been heated for another couple of minutes. This is not what I expected from an Italian restaurant. Will stick to the local pizza chain which was far better tasting and value for price. Avoid unless you are very hungry

Text: I had my wedding reception here in March and it went wonderfully. Several of my guests commented how much they enjoyed the food and I also thought it was brilliant.
The venue allows for diy decorations and has speakers and microphones available for use. The staff helped us to set up and pack up everything.
Even through multiple staffing changes since I booked to when I was married, everything we had planned went pretty much exactly how I had hoped.
We found the crown and anchor staff to be very flexible and accommodating and overall it is a great venue if you are wanting an affordable space that is still beautiful and with great food. We had about 50 guests which fit very well in the space.
Thank you Kalila and the crown and anchor team.

Text: Felt like a steak for Sunday night dinner. For a pub there was only one option which was surprising but it was Sunday night. 300g Sirloin with chips and salad. The salad was nothing special but fresh. Chips were how I like them, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. The steak was interesting. A little dry in spots, but not bad. Possibly my fault as I like steaks medium and this was a low fat steak. I like fat on a steak and the parts that had some fat were perfect. Cooked perfectly for a medium steak and beautifully seared on the outside with a nice flame grill. Don't let me sound like I am complaining. If I could cook a steak like this I would be more than happy and so much better than many steaks I have had recently.
As for the two young ladies who looked after me I hope the pub looks after them. Excellent service. Polite, attentive and first class.
Give the pub a go. Excellent value for money and overall a great experience.

Text: Staff, venue & atmosphere I rate 5 stars but my meal was sadly only a dismal 2! The staff were so friendly, welcoming & I couldn't fault them. My friends enjoyed their meals but I was very disappointed indeed. I order a warm pumpkin salad & paid $12 more for warm salmon. I'm yet to see any salmon (maybe there were 2 small tea spoons added). The pumpkin was in one big hunk, uncooked & too hard to cut & the salad was a tiny small handful of greens! The flavour was lovely & the 2 little pieces of feta were nice. For the price I expected a WHOLE lot more. Plus the luke warm hot chocolate was served in the smallest cup I've ever seen & NO marshmallows. It's not that hard to have a packet of them handy! I was not impressed... üòû

The verandah is a stunning spot to bask in the sun, watch the ships roll in and have a cocktail. The beer garden is great for a chill hangout with a group and inside is great for a large sit down gathering. This place has it all.
The staff have been so friendly and helpful on every occasion. Nothing is a bother and they always have a solution. They have made sure that I have easy access for a pram, they always come and take orders in a timely fashion and they seem to always be handy, without hovering.

Lots of fresh veg but hardly any soup, noodles still stuck together and 4 pieces of tiny dry chicken as you can see in the photo. Beef Burger was tasteless and small but lots of chips. Cake was the stand out. Salmon was lovely and well cooked but comes with a cold sauce! Horrible!
Venue is beautiful but service is lacking. Overall disappointing but could be so much better!

Text: The food was excellent, however, not cheap and small portions of ramen. I understand that it's hard to compare to Sydney but just for reference for those wondering, a ramen can be had on average from $16-$20. Their price of $22 isn't far off,  but the servings in Sydney are 50% larger in noodle serving and broth. Still deserves 5 stars because the taste was spot on and absolutely delicious, the toilets were clean, the staff were friendly and the restaurant was clean. Will definitely be back, but not as regular as I would like due to value.
