Text: The staff were exceptionally friendly & helpful.
When I arrived one of the two lifts was broken, and in no time the second one joined in. The fella behind reception let me use the goods lift.
The room was nice and big, I had a view of the Grand Hotel.
The bathroom was very mouldy, & was comical in size. The door to the shower was 42cm wide. In the shower I could touch the heel of my left foot to the wall behind me, and with my feet heel to toe could touch the opposite wall with the big toe of my right foot.
This was also the width of the whole bathroom.
My hand spanned the entirety of the basin.
It was easier to sit down to pee (I’m a bloke) because there was no where to stand in front of the toilet.
I am not a giant.

Text: Staff were friendly enough and the location is good, one of the elevators was out of service, my room had leftovers in the fridge (pierced milk cartons) from the previous person still in the room. The bathroom was small with black mould, and I was locked out of my room multiple times because my key card stopped working, not very convenient and quite frustrating having to go down and get it replaced each time.

Text: My First Stay on my own was in
a Match Box Room
This time I did a last minute booking due to the XPT Train arriving late into Southern Cross Station with my husband
We got a King Room
The Bathroom is so compact that my husband was unable to shower, which is very disappointing for a King Room
There is no luggage rack to place the Travelling Bags and no Hand Towel, just two tiny Face washers
For the price we paid I am not impressed!
Would prefer not to stay here

The only real drawback I had is the extremely thin walls. And people drying hair at 2 am showering at anytime, you hear it all. Dont come without earplugs!

Hotel staff very accomodating and easy to book.
Very welcoming on arrival.

We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment with our 4 children.
Room was extremely clean and great layout. Very quiet we didn’t hear any noise from other rooms or outside. Beds were so comfortable. The balcony great size.

Room service: easy to order, quick 30 mins max arrival and the food was amazing.

Parking: secure parking with number plate recognition access.

We will definitely be coming back and recommending. Thank you.

Text: Stayed on Saturday night. Room was ok - clean but extremely dated, TV was barely working. Shower in the bath - really needs renovation. Stunk of old cigarette smoke in the hallway to get to the room very off putting.

Service.. checked out early Sunday morning and got the night manager - charged me for my beer no worries. Asked for receipt for the $50 charge they take off you when you check in to confirm this has been refunded. Response no you don’t need that it will just take 3 days and the hold will come off your card. Into day 4 now the hold which is now not a hold and a $50 charge on my card has not been refunded. Called them - yep no worries I’ll get that sorted for you again asked for some confirmation via email and still have nothing. Very average service. It’s only a small ammount of money yes but it isn’t theirs to keep!

Location was good.

We ordered oysters, the T Bone. crispy skin barramundi, crab ravioli, wedge salad and asparagus. The ravioli was to die for. Perfect balance of the sweetness of the crab and the lemony tartness of the sauce. T Bone and the fish was cooked perfectly. The T Bone was charcoal grilled and served with crispy wedge potatoes and baby lettuce. All of this was against the backdrop of the beach and the sea.

We had the most lovely room. Incredibly comfortable night sleep, the bed was very comfortable.
It was a shame we were only there one night as the room was ideal for a long weekend away, everything you need, including the Nescafé machine.
The only downside was the cleaners had missed a few things, even rubbish in the bin under the sink from the last people. Also we had a little bit of a problem with an alarm on the fridge going off loudly during the night.

The rooms are huge compared to modern hotels and are well equipped.  This one had a full kitchen and even a large fridge.  Secondary windows have been installed behind the original ones so it's double glazed and very quiet but they open if you want which is nice.  A hand written welcome card from Denis along with some lindt chocolates was a lovely touch that made me smile.  Perfect location as a base, I'll stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.

Mains I had vegetarian penne, husband had seafood pasta while others had vegetarian risotto and steaks (one with dmsakad abd onw with chips).  Drinks - Proseccos, red wines, ber, cokes and coffees (decaf soy latte and flat whites). Also cannoli and vanilla gelati.  Hadn't been to La Camera in years so good to go back.  Really great position in Southgate so nice views.  Lots of seating too.  However husband was quite sick later and only thing he had different that could have possibly caused this was the seafood.

Service was quick, we didn’t wait long for our meals at all.
We ordered the arancini which were nearly as good as my mums, but possibly the best I’ve had in a restaurant, calamari were very fresh & tender, the risotto & gnocchi were also good - I’m a tough critic when it comes to Italian food as being Italian I cook it myself at home all the time, however - it was nice to have it cooked for me.
Overall, it was a lovely experience!

Food was absolutely disgusting
Service was a joke and the waiters are absolutely usless there was one waiter with long black hair and his English was absolutely garbage
The place needs to update it's menu as the food is out of date. Possible the owner should sell and someone else that knows how to Run a restaurant should take over by far one of the worst restaurants I have been to in the cbd.
There was that much oil on my plate that I couldn't even finsih my meal I'm very disappointed and a waste of money

Text: Firstly, the food was incredible. I think It's hard to have dinner at a place where you would rate every single course of the night 5 stars, but the pizza and lasagne were excellent, and the dessert, tiramasu  and gelati were perfect 👌🏻.

Servers were friendly and quick, meal arrived to us within 10-15 minutes of ordering (on a Wednesday night), and the atmosphere was cool and quiet, we had the fortune of a nice well lit window seat.

I'll be coming back for my Mum's birthday as a nice surprise for her.

Text: Very friendly staff. We stayed for 4 nights. However, our 2 bedroom apartment was nothing like the pictures on the website.  Pictures showed a full kitchen with island bench but we had a minute galley kitchen which if 2 people were sitting at the kitchen side of the dining table, meant that you couldn't open the oven or dishwasher doors.
Pictures showed a sitting area with 2 large couches.
Ours had 1 tiny couch that just fitted 2 people as long as you were friends.
There were beds for 5 squeezed into the 2 bedrooms. Master plus a single in one room but no space to put any bags.
2 singles beds in second bedroom with less than a rulers width between them.
Tiles in the shower were extremely slippery when wet, so I had to buy a nonslip mat before letting my 100 yr old mother use it. The kitchen was badly stocked re crockery and cutlery. For Eg, 2 bowls, 2 mugs, 2 wine glasses, 8 plates.
Cleaners were very helpful, but when I checked under the beds, while packing to leave, I found 3 miss matched socks and a bra insert, none of which were ours. To be fair, there is so little space in the bedrooms that it is almost impossible to look under the beds.
We were 3 adults and it was unsatisfactory, but I pity any family of 5 trying to stay there!
Sadly, we had hoped that it might work for regular visits, but we will be looking elsewhere.

Text: If you just need a room for the night then it’s acceptable. The room I had was executive. It had a queen bed, a lounge to sit on and a single bed. The furnishing is old and marked. The bed was comfortable and for the price of $127 it was fine for the night.
When I pulled down the blinds it had dozens of squished dead mosquitoes and bugs. Bad enough to the point I asked the reception to clean it while I went to get dinner as it was quite gross. She did make a comment that it was something that happened often which made me wonder why then the cleaners weren’t doing a better job.
The shower was over a bath which was very annoying and would be impossible for some to use. When getting out I nearly slipped given there is quite a decent step over the bath to the ground and nothing but glass to hold onto which you wouldn’t grab for safety reasons.
It was a budget hotel.

Bugs everywhere. Walls cracked so bad we were worried the roof was going to collapse.

Text: Sadly, we didn't have the best experience. My husband and I booked for a couple of nights stay in a queen bed suit. When we arrived, we were told we had not booked a room and had to pay a $100 security deposit (nowhere on the website, did it say you needed to pay a security deposit and we are still waiting on the deposit refund).
We had specifically booked a queen suite, as my husband is over 6ft. We were given the keys to a double bed suite. When we asked for a queen suite, we had to pay extra (even though we paid for a queen bed).The room was nice, but it was in need of some TLC. There was no microwave, the TV did not work (had to be replaced), and the blind was covered in dead bugs (see photo). Also, the room did not look anything like the online photos.
We found the bathroom to be rather gross. The tiles and glass had mouldy grout and silicone around them (see photos). The tiles on the wall and glass had drip marks down it and didn't look  like it had been cleaned properly. The bathtub had some sort of mark on the edge, and the water pressure and temperature was terrible.
Lastly, the bathroom window had spider webs on the frame (see photo) and didn't look like it had been cleaned in a while.

great experience. Beautiful old pub with amazing character and charm. Fire places everywhere which add to the overall vibe. Public bar was pumping and a lot of fun. Restaurant was very nice as were the amazing steaks and wine list too chose from. If your in Middle Park, do not drive past this place. Drop in,  enjoy a cold beer and just relax.

Text: We love coming here and enjoyed apartment room one level one which is spacious, cosy with a gas fire and charming. The food in the bar is just excellent and better than the 5 star hotels you find yourself in. I love this place for its relaxed suburban location, next to coffee shops, a tram stop, the ocean and st Kilda. Staff are friendly and helpful. We can’t wait to return.

Text: Upon visiting your establishment for a roast dinner, I had high expectations, having read favorable reviews. Initially, the bar staff were attentive, but upon the arrival of our roast, priced at $34, my anticipation waned. While the beef was satisfactory, the broccolini was served raw, the Yorkshire pudding was dense like a sponge, and the potatoes lacked the desired crispiness. As a purveyor of Sunday roasts, it's imperative that such staples are executed flawlessly. Upon expressing our dissatisfaction to the waitress, she acknowledged the shortcomings. After a brief wait, the manager approached us to inquire about our discontentment. It was expressed, in jest, that the individual responsible for the Yorkshire pudding's preparation should be dismissed. Regrettably, this lighthearted comment was misconstrued. As a British patron, I trust you can appreciate the intent behind such humor. In conclusion, I advise potential patrons seeking a quality Sunday roast to look elsewhere. This experience stands out as one of the least satisfactory in my seven years of residency here. Additionally, fostering an environment receptive to constructive feedback and displaying professionalism among staff members would greatly enhance customer satisfaction.

Text: Food was really nice and the staff were very friendly and attentive. No problem there at all. It is pricey for what you get I think. $30 for a burger is steep!! It was a good burger but not outstanding. Also there was jugs of water at our table and I don't know if it's because the building is old but it tasted funky and smelled like it had been sitting in a public toilet for a really really long time. I have no idea what is happening with the water but I've never tasted or smelled anything like it. I think that needs to be sorted.

Text: We always drove pass this pub on Victoria Street after we went IKEA and never try it before. We found there's a deal on Groupon , therefore let's buy and try ! We made a booking tonight for both of us and our kid.
The environment is very nice, doesn't look like the typical pub (u know what I mean) , quite elegant and tidy.
We sit down and found out they put our name on the reservation note, that's little warm trick better than lots of restaurant!
Then we ordered the two starters and the two mains and the two drinks as what the Groupon offered and also an extra kid meal
The starters are nice, popcorn chicken are freshly made , one of the best ! perfect with the beer ! the corn rib , also not bad !
The kid meal come first , its' half size parma with chips and surprisingly come with nice salad !!!!! This is one of the best kids meal i told the owner !!! because you know most of the kid meal never provide any veggie and my kid loves veggie

And then our main comes - the Grilled porterhouse and chicken !!! SO YUM !! Worth to come here !

Lastly the owner so nice and gave us the desert !! you need to try !!

Highly recommend you need to try this restaurant for sure !

Text: Had delightful time here as per usual. There’s nothing bad on the menu after dining here over 6 times. It stays true to Chinese but with a twist. The steamed buns and dumplings weren’t the best so don’t expect a full yumcha experience here, but dumplings are dumplings. The stir fry, fried rice and the noodles were great. Love the drink menu rotation especially the traditional festival inspired/limited drinks. The dessert wasn’t its strongest suit but the mains definitely make up for it. Will keep coming back for sure.

The dumplings overall with the great selection of sauces were great as well as the duck pancake and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce but we didn’t find the special fried rice and white chocolate dumplings as enjoyable.  The beer selection was very good.  I recommend but do research on dishes.

The newly renovated decor provides a nice intimate vibe for date tonight, casual catch up or a family event.

The staff were very friendly, the friend that I came here with had been a few times and the owner recognised him and even took some time to chat. This adds a nice and personal touch and keeps him coming back.

Given the quality of the food, the ambience of the restaurant and the quality of the service we thought this was a great price. Thank you so much for the experience!

Text: We had a company team meeting lunch here. As the group is bigger than 8+, we had to order a feed me menu which we were okay with at the start. The options on the menu are slightly limited and you can't choose whatever you want on the list. We opted to go with 8 dishes and the option we have to select 2 items from the stream section and the deep fry, 3 items from the main and one dessert. None of us eat Asian dessert so we asked to swap it with something else and you can only pick from the stream section to replace dessert. You can't just choose dumplings and Dim Sim for all 8 dishes.
As we had all the food details sorted before the day, we were expected a little quicker service than we received. They especially advertise the feed me as unlimited feed that can reorder as much as you can eat in 90 minutes (8 dishes for $56 per person). The first set of stream and fried dishes didn't get to the table until 22 minutes after we seated. Then when we finished all the stream and fry dishes and tried to order a couple more dishes, we were then told we can't reorder anything until all the dishes on the lists have arrived. All the mains and the rest of the dishes arrived at the table after 45 minutes. The staff took some reorder items then. Not all of group like eating the same things so we all reorder want we want to eat and the item I reorder which is a prawn and shallots wonton didn't arrive until 70 minutes into the seating time.
All the reorder dishes also go down in size, for example, the veggies spring roll has 6 pieces in the first serve, but only 4 in the second serve so when we thought one serve will be enough but then some people had to miss out.
To finish it off, they still manage to put through wrong charges of 10 dishes at $68 per person at the start after spending 5 minutes going through the 8 dishes to confirm our order.
Overall very disappointed with the group booking and foods.

They are on top of it always, attention to detail is immaculate and my partner and I love it here.

The steaks are just THAT good. We have traveled to Europe, Japan etc and the steaks here are always better.

We love it here. Coeliac approved. Fully gluten free menu so no risk of feeling sick, they’re on top of it and genuinely care. I’ve never gotten sick here from gluten, not even a second of a stomach ache.

Text: I nearly cancelled my booking after reading reviews. Thankfully I didn’t! Fantastic location - nice end of town, short walk to retail centre, botanic gardens. Tram stop less than 1 min walk away. Friendly and helpful staff - allowed us early access to both rooms. We booked a 1 bedroom suite, so tonnes of room. The kitchenette  was very handy. Yes the bathroom is dated but really who cares? As long as it is clean and in working order. The negatives - surrounded by other buildings so room is dark, we never opened the curtain. no walk in shower. I used the gym showers on top floor instead. The tv didn’t work properly but after the first day, we never turned it on again because too busy with exploring Melbourne! The microwave also didn’t work. Loved the heated  pool and the spa especially at dawn. For $190 per night, this hotel was good value.  Will def book again!

Text: ****Terrible experience, I do not recommend coming here - poor negligence and communication****

I left my room on the second day of my stay and later returned in the evening to see housekeeping cleaned my room but saw my personal item went missing. I notified hotel staff about my missing item and they said they were going to follow up the next morning. I didn’t get any updates until I asked again the next evening. The receptionist told me that housekeeping may have saw it in the bin when they were cleaning. It was confusing why they conveniently ended up in the bin when I knew for certain I left them on the basin table.

They communicated to only compensate me a fraction of the cost instead of the full amount, they won't take any responsibility and withdrew their previous statement to me. Poor communication.  Please do not stay at this hotel where items go missing but take 0 responsibility.

*** EDIT - After they replied to me to try sort out a solution, they stopped responding to me :) No genuine customer service. Seems as though they only replied to my public review to seem empathetic! ***

No phone in room, air conditioning was so old that we were scared to turn it on.  Bathroom was filthy  sink was covered in some sort of sealant, shower was so low that I had to bend over backwards just to rinse my hair, tiles were off, or missing, silicone holding shower glass on by a thread. Service was not great, they didn't even have our booking in computer.  Definitely would not recommend.

Text: My recent stay at Sandown Regency Motor Inn Hotel was nothing short of a nightmare. Upon entering the room, I was greeted by a nauseating odor that seemed to emanate from the stained blanket on the bed. The table was littered with remnants of curry, indicating a lack of cleanliness and attention to detail by the housekeeping staff. Adding to the discomfort, the fridge in the room was broken and contained someone else’s clothes, which only added to the feeling of unhygienic conditions. Despite bringing these issues to the attention of the staff, there was little effort made to rectify the situation. It’s clear this Hotel fails to meet even the most basic standards of cleanliness and hospitality, and I would strongly advise against booking a stay here.

We were waiting for the table more than 30mins (booked 6.30pm, have to wait on waiting area, got to table 7ish) and seem like the chef was tired and everything seem to be rush to get it done within 8.00pm (Another booking was waiting too)

For the food , we paid $118 per person and what we got ....
Starter
- Cold , bland miso soup
- 1 bite of sushi each
- 1 small serve of sashimi
- 1 tiny toast with beef&forgra on top
Main
- 1 grilled prawn, 3 pcs scallop
- 1 serve of grilled chicken
- 1 serve of grilled beef

Side
- Stir fried mix veggie (mostly beanshoot 🥲)
- Cold, bland egg fired rice (tiny bowl)

And a bit of entertainment at the end.
- Throw the bowl
- Throw the omelette

For the $118 I don't think it a fair price for what I got.

The stars just for the good beef and waitress.

Text: When Entertainment Steals the Quality

It's fascinating to note that this dinner ranks among the most entertaining I've been to, yet the food experience falls short with tremendously subpar quality.

The set menu's price doesn't justify the quality of the dishes, a significant portion seems allocated to the entertainment factor. If entertainment is your priority, this is the go-to place. However, the food itself barely reaches an "edible" status, let alone the standards of a decent restaurant.

Credit to our chef for bringing fun and entertainment, but the overall quality of the meal doesn't meet the expectations of a restaurant. It's a tough recommendation.

As seasoned enthusiasts of Japanese cuisine, we frequented this restaurant along with other top-tier Japanese establishments in years past. This restaurant was very popular and always bustling. However, during our recent visit, it was half empty. The ownership was changed. There are lots of new restaurants in the city, more competition.

The children over 10 years old were required to order from the adult set menu, rather than having the option of choosing from the children's menu or selecting dishes a la carte.

Overall, this restaurant may be suitable for those who prioritize ambiance and Teppanyaki style over the food itself, it's not a good choice for families with children and people who wanted taste true Japanese quality foods.

Text: I have been going to this restaurant since 1989 and it is still my favourite in all of Melbourne. It is a classy, sophisticated venue, making you feel special as soon as you step through their door. There is a lovely room off to the side where you can enjoy pre or post dinner drinks and/or dessert. I just love this place. Its a hidden gem so do yourself a favour.

Consistently meticulously prepped Cantonese food that’s wheeled out on trolleys, and my Peking duck was prepared at the table with a few quick manoeuvres by the expert waiter. It’s practically performance art as you dine - not bad. Food was full of flavour and tasty, and a work of art. The Flower Drum’s mantra is a dedicated service that combines great food, fine wine, impeccable service for a unique dining experience each and every time – and it delivers in spades. This is not your everyday restaurant, but a special occasion spot to impress the family or out-of-town guests or simply treat yourself. Very highly recommended 👏👍😊

Generous pieces of chicken in deliciously creamy curry soon kept us occupied. I looked around and every dish was empty. Lots of praise by the colleagues who enjoyed their meals. For $12 this was extremely good value in a sit down restaurant.

The decor hasn't been updated for ... and the menus are worn, but we came here for neither. As we excited, the owner cheekily says "see you next week." I can understand how my colleagues have become regulars here.

The establishment is very clean and actually has a great vibe. The staff are very friendly and welcoming which is always a plus.

There’s lots of room for functions as well as booths for something more private.

There’s a decent bar selection of wines and spirits  (although I’m not a drinker) there’s also a coffee machine with some lovely cakes  (a must for us mums)

The kitchen area is open, and looks very clean.  The food came out fast and the portions are just enough to fill a hungry tummy). Sometimes pubs give such a huge serve that it ends up being a waste. There’s a great selection for the seniors too which are very affordable.

Kids meals are decent with the standard options that one would expect (fish n chips, nuggets n chips, salads, pasta) for $12.

I ordered a chicken Caesar salad it came out fresh and well prepared.

There’s a bowling area, kids indoor playground, as well as an arcade all well kept, clean and great to vent some energy before or after a meal.

To the back is also a sports bar and gaming lounge (can’t comment on the state of either as under 18 is not permitted and I have 2 littles with me)

At the front there is a seperate entrance in the foyer to a “club” with a small stage, dance floor, bar and booths.

They charge you $30 for chicken drumstick and 2 thin pieces of briskets (photo does not do justice of what was on the plate).I don't think it's ok at all. It's a child's plate.

This family-run & owned restaurant has been standing for SEVENTEEN (17) years 🤯 has won so many awards 🏅 AND visits from famous Australians 🙊

We had their Royal Feast 1 ($35pp) and got:
🔼 Samosas
Best samosas we’ve ever had for sure! It came out hot & crispy, tasted homemade.

🍗 Chicken Tikka
This was well marinated & the smoky flavor from being cooked in the Tandoor really shone through.

🍖 Lamb Shank Curry
Super tender, melt-in-your-mouth lamb. Curry flavor was great to complement the flavor of the lamb itself. This was perfect being eaten with the papadams & raita (yogurt) to have that contrast of crispy & soft texture in one bite.

🥘 Butter Chicken
Easily the best we’ve ever had! I’m obsessed with the smokiness flavor and the well balanced sweet & savory levels. This was perfect with naan or rice (+ raita if you’d like). Definitely my favorite! ⭐️

++ sides: rice, papadams, chutney, dips, naan, raita (yogurt)
** Free to choose 2 curries from the menu too

This feast is such a good deal. They’re very welcoming to your taste (spiciness level, etc) as well as generous with their portions 🥰

Time your feast well with their 💃🏻 Happy Hour session 💃🏻 (4:30pm - 5:30pm AND 8:30 - 9:30pm) to get $10 Cocktails or Mocktails 😋

We highly recommend you to visit this place, not only you’re supporting Australian businesses, you’re also getting a great deal on delicious food & drinks ‼️

They were busy and must have been short staffed, but i sat in my car for 10 minutes and then went back inside only to see 1 of my orders sitting open on the bench getting cold whilst the other was waiting for the meat to be fried on the hot plate, the heat in the chips slowly dissipating into the shop. After what felt like an eternity they closed the container because clearly there was no more heat to save from the chips...and placed the container into a brown bag. Everything was cold and they had left out 1 of the 2 sauces my son ordered .  Originally my son asked me why I didn't want to go there, and I said it was because they have stuffed up my last 3 orders out of 5. Once upon a time this place was fast and efficient. I wont go back again. Even when I called the previous time to complain about the order that was stuffed up yet again, the chap I was speaking with had the same level of care and empathy as a dead ant hanging onto the sole of a mud encrusted shoe.

Text: Great tasting kebabs and their chips are honestly 10/10. Shame that their service doesnt match the food ...
We ordered online for 8pm on a wednesday night (so not super busy). Got a text that our order would be ready at 8, but had to wait over 20 minutes in their shop. Was just two falafels and chips.
No one seems to be in a rush to get the food out, they all take their time.

I came here with some friends on a friday night too and legit they had to wait in the freezing cold for over an hour after the time text message said to arrive at. I understand it can be hard when its busy but they dont even look like they are trying to keep up.

If you dont mind waiting for your food, I would recommend this place, because the food is really tasty here :)

Text: So disappointed, so expensive. I ordered off the menu and couldn’t figure out why it was so expensive, the receipt is confusing then I realised that I was over charged, went to the counter and was told prices have gone up, I need to look online at the prices. This is not good enough I ordered from the instore menu and I should be charged as per advertised prices, but they refused to give me a refund. Never ever coming back again.

He seemed like a really nice guy and did what he could to help but couldn’t do or process any refunds due his owners not being there and also not speaking English.

Text: The food and drinks are good. There were 8 meats, 1. chicken wings
2. Chicken hearts
3. Chicken drum stick
4. pork sausage
5. Pork neck
6. Lamb
7. Steak slices
8. Beef rib

If you're not a chicken lover you do need to wait a while for other meats to appear.  The salads are basic and complement the meats. You can have unlimited meat and salads which start from 730pm.
The steak slices were the nicest. The staff were friendly. We would have liked there to be some show or dancing earlier rather than later. The show starting at 10pm was a bit late since we arrived at 730pm. Overall quite a good night and definitely worth the groupon deal for a one off experience but I  would not be keen to pay the full price.

I tried a large supreme pizza which was loaded full of toppings and had more than your standard amount of cheese, as well as a serve of spaghetti bolognese, pasta was average although the bolognese sauce was quite good in my opinion, though the serving size was on the small side for the price( serving size good for 1 person only, too small to split between 2 people) They are open till late( 1am) even during the week, good for those late night cravings. Not wholly authentic Italian cuisine but worth a try nonetheless...

Text: ⭐☆☆☆☆

I recently stayed in Building 37 at Crest on Barkly, and my experience was extremely disappointing. Here are the key issues I encountered during my stay:

Room Quality

•	Low Standards: The room was of very low quality. The electric sockets felt unsafe, and the king bed was a nightmare to sleep on. I woke up with back pain every morning because the bed’s springs were pinching my entire back. It felt like I was sleeping on a pile of springs with minimal cushioning. It’s unacceptable to offer such uncomfortable accommodations, regardless of the reason for a guest’s stay. This part of the hotel, Building 37, seemed neglected and subpar compared to what one might expect from a hotel.
•	Toxic Environment: The room’s windows were old-style and extremely difficult to open. This made the room feel stuffy and created a toxic environment. Fresh air was hard to come by, and the lack of ventilation made the room feel suffocating. It’s unacceptable to have such poorly maintained windows that prevent guests from enjoying a comfortable and healthy stay.

Service and Experience

•	Pizza Delivery Fiasco: I scheduled a pizza delivery through Menulog, but the pizza never arrived. Although Menulog marked it as delivered, it never reached me. When I contacted the staff, I got no helpful response. It was confusing and frustrating, and I still don’t understand what happened to my order.
•	Reception Staff: The reception staff, mainly from Indian backgrounds, were unhelpful and dismissive. It felt like I was being underestimated due to my background and the fact that my stay was government-supported. Regardless of a guest’s background or circumstances, everyone deserves respect and proper service, which was lacking here.

Overall Impression

Staying at Building 37 in Crest on Barkly was one of the most confusing and uncomfortable experiences I’ve had. I risked both online and face-to-face interactions due to the poor handling of my concerns. Crest on Barkly needs to realize that every guest deserves respect and high service standards, regardless of their background or the building they are placed in.

I would not recommend staying in Building 37 until significant improvements are made in room quality and customer service. It’s crucial that management takes these issues seriously and addresses the discrimination and low standards currently in place.

Text: Myself and my partner stayed here for one night and unfortunately we had a terrible experience. On check in we were informed that we had been upgraded to an alternative room. At 01.15am a man walked into our bedroom and gave us both an awful fright. It was a traumatic experience to find out that another gentleman had been checked into our room at this hour. The room itself was very basic and the place needs an upgrade. At 7.20 the same person whom checked us in then came knocking on our door to find out who was in the room even though he checked us into that room. We were advised he would speak to the manger about that this and see what he could. On check out he openly apologised and admitted it was his fault as he did not update the system yesterday on our arrival for the night staff. All we were offered was a cold breakfast which we kindly refused while his colleague behind the desk sniggered and laughed at the situation. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour and completely unprofessional. I would not return here and would like to reach out to the manager for a formal complaint

Text: I had an extremely disappointing experience, i booked to stay at their other location - Crest on Park in St Kilda. When I arrived, there was a sign directing me to this location instead for check-in—a 20-minute walk each way with luggage. This crucial detail was not advertised anywhere, which was incredibly frustrating.

The most frustrating part was the lack of reception at Crest on Park. I waited and called four times before someone finally answered. The staff were rude and made me feel very uncomfortable. When I mentioned that I would contact the third party to cancel my booking due to their lack of care and inability to accomodate, I was met with, “You’re not going to get your money back” and “Go for it.”

It’s unacceptable not to advertise that you can’t check in at the property, but having rude staff without any compassion is even worse. They seriously need to improve their service and transparency.

I would not recommend staying here.

Text: Biggest gripe is portion sizes. We were a party of 3 and most dishes were probably enough for 2 but the person taking our order did encourage us to order an extra hopper as there were only 2. That was really nice with the duck it was served with. Tamarind fish was fresh and tasty although I personally found the sauce too peppery for my liking.

Least favourite dish was the chicken it was so dry and not palatable. Okra was nice but portion size was underwhelming we only had one spoonful each. Same issue with the rice not enough to go for second servings.

Love cake was not what I was use to, it had an almond like paste at the bottom and cake on the top. Lack the spice component which is what makes the Sri Lankan love cake unique.

Text: We had dinner at this Sri Lankan restaurant tonight and tried the black pork curry, lamb curry, and deviled prawns with steamed white basmati rice. For dessert, we had Wattilappam, which was amazing. The food was good, and the prawns were particularly juicy. However, it didn't quite taste like authentic Sri Lankan cuisine. The twist they added to the traditional dishes works well to cater to a broader audience. The service was alright, but we found the cost to be on the expensive side, especially considering the small portion sizes. The ambiance was good too, adding to the overall dining experience.

Text: First some facts - all menu items have gone up between 25-33% since the same time last year.
Traditional Pizza - from $17 to $22 large
Gourmet Pizza - from $18 to $24 large
Tony's Super Supreme - from $20 to $26 large
Black Angus Scotch fillet - from $34 plus FREE sauce for 350gm..... to $38 plus $5 extra for sauce for 300gm!

And here's what the food looks like...this was a $28 half/half "Tony's Super Supreme"/Hawaiian (plus $2 extra for half/half, which I didn't know when ordering over the phone because I just asked "half half supreme and Hawaiian"). We assumed it was priced at a premium due to the addition of prawns....

But as you can see there is a single prawn on the supreme half cut up into tiny pieces! The Hawaiian is mostly ham and very little cheese. Very disrespectful to customers to do this.

We get there is inflationary pressure on prices at the moment but if you go to Queen Vic market you'll notice that meat and seafood prices haven't risen THIS much. I also live nearby and see that the place is fairly busy....

Which suggests to me the price and quality is poor because they can get away with it (plenty of hotels and short stay accommodation around).

Please don't waste your time or money. Pathetic.

Additionally, the last two times I've picked up my pizza order, the staff forgot about me, leaving my food to go cold.

The “Hawaiian” pizza is literally a pile of ham slices and a couple pineapple with barely any cheese. We couldn’t even eat it, it was that gross. The last time I checked, pizza is supposed to have cheese on it? I ordered a Hawaiian not “just a pile of ham please, hold the cheese.” Lol
Also delivery took an hour and a half on a Monday night. And we are less than a 10 min drive from the location. All in all it was not a good experience at all. Giving it 2 stars because the Caesar salad was decent.

What we had:

Malai chaap/lamb cutlets, so juicy, so packed with flavours and really delicious entree that is a must try.

Delhi’s goat masala curry, a curry that is so flavoursome and mouthwatering, can’t explain how good it was smelling, and those tender pieces of meat melted in the mouth right from the very first bite, highly recommended

Butter chicken, a classic and it was very satisfying to eat, good portion size as well.

Peas pulps, a delectable rice dish with peas and tasted so well with the curries. Must try.

Kashmiri naan, sweet and soft bread pairs well with the curries.

Paan flavoured kulfi and gulab jamun, if you haven’t tried this flavour then it’s must try for its soothing and sweet flavours. Strongly recommended

All the food are here of fantastic quality and taste, and the drinks were equally refreshing. The prices are very standard. The service is prompt and attentive by the welcoming, polite and friendly staff and owner. You will definitely have a great time here.

My son  had one bite and knew there were nuts. So he rang.
We were  told ingredients included almonds and pinenuts.
I observed this phone call.   An anaphylactic reaction was inevitable . I rang and asked to speak to manager.   I asked for the ingredients immediately and explained why.  He responded with "I used to  make it and blah blah. Sense of urgency....not!!

Text: We recently visited Desi Dhaba in Melbourne, and it was an exceptional experience that transported us straight to the heart of India. This restaurant truly stands out for its authenticity, with dishes that are bursting with traditional flavors and spices.

What we had:
- Tandoori Meat Platter ($29.5): An impressive assortment of tandoori meats, each piece marinated to perfection and cooked just right, offering a delicious introduction to the meal.
- Punjabi Butter Chicken ($23.9): Absolutely divine. The chicken was tender, bathed in a rich, creamy sauce with a beautiful balance of spices that was comforting and addictive.
- Goat Vindaloo ($23.9): For those who like it hot, this dish delivered. The goat was tender, and the sauce was a vibrant mix of tangy and spicy flavors that packed a serious punch.
- Garlic Naan ($5): The perfect sidekick to every dish, soft, warm, and fragrant with garlic, it was ideal for sopping up all that delicious sauce.

The ambiance of Desi Dhaba adds to the allure, with eclectic decor that captures the vibrant energy of India, making the dining environment as delightful as the food.

What really made our visit memorable was the service. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring we felt welcomed and well taken care of throughout our meal.

Desi Dhaba isn't just a place to eat; it's a destination. For anyone in Melbourne craving authentic Indian cuisine, this restaurant is a must-visit. It offers a genuine taste of India's culinary richness, combined with heartwarming hospitality that makes you want to return. We'll definitely be back for more!

Text: Yummy and affordable Indian food in Melbourne, @desidhaba_melbourne on Flinders is a great spot to indulge in tasty curries, rice, naan and even cocktails too.

What we had here:

Seekh kebab, so delectable but felt a bit dry though, goes well with the Indian condiments especially the mint chutney.

Masala saag curry with goat, quite flavourful and the meat was super tender and goes perfectly well with either rice or naan, must try

Aloo gobi, such a comfort meal this, I absolutely loved the flavours in it, reminded me of home, highly recommended

Malai kofta curry, this was my favourite had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy flavours in it, so delicious and definitely a must try.

Saffron rice, was light and yum.

Cheese naan, an indulgent but great with curries.

Pineapple cocktail,
Mint mojito, both the drinks were super refreshing

The serving size is very generous and the quality seems good for the pocket friendly prices. Service is very prompt and the staff are all very helpful and attentive. Definitely a great vibe here and are open till very late in the night.

I've always wanted to try their dishes, but somehow Desi Dhaba fell through the cracks, till yesterday, when I finally ordered something, and I was quite happy with my food. I didn't have anything for dinner so I decided to order from this place via DoorDash.

🤤🔥

I ordered a Dum Chicken Biryani ($20.90) and an Onion And Green Chilli Salad ($4.50). There was an ongoing offer, so my overall bill was $20.28, all inclusive. Carefully handed to me by the dasher, I couldn't wait to get to my room and dig in. The quantity was good, something I focus on more these days, and even though the chicken pieces were medium-sized, there were enough. The rice was excellent, full of flavours, mildly spicy, and the raita with carrots was a welcome addition. The salad with onions and not-hot green chillies was dressed with some ground spices and I squeezed some lemon that cane with it. It tasted great with the biryani. Overall, a simple, but satisfying dish, and I'd go back for more.

👌🏽💯

Irrespective of the ratings, I was pretty happy with my food, and if I'm around the restaurant, I'm going to pop in. They've a an exciting menu, and I eagerly look forward to trying their other dishes!

Dishes ordered:

Dum Chicken Biryani - $20.90
Onion And Green Chilli Salad - $4.50

Text: We booked the place for 20-25 people for an office dinner party. The host was not ready and made arrangements after we asked about it. The food was fine, staff was fine. Ambience wise nothing too fancy just a basic setup. I haven’t heard great reviews about it but food was not that bad. I liked the snacks more than the main course.

Text: I booked for 15 people ten days out. We arrived and 9 of us ordered Banquet B. 1 hour and 42 minutes after we ordered, the first of the soups arrived. Not all of them. 2 hours and 22 minutes after we ordered the entrees turned up for some of us and again not for all of us. Other diners arrived, ordered, ate and left. 5 Banquet Bs turned out to be five soups and two mains with enough rice for two people. Really? Even an inexperienced waitress would question the lack of food for five people. Waitress then said we didn’t order Banquets but when we complained about the service the excuse was that they were too busy and that we ordered a lot of Banquets. Over three hours in, table after table that arrived after us were fed and left with us still waiting. Never ever going back. One job to do and that’s feed customers and they couldn’t even do that. A possible $600 - $700 table sitting turned out to be a lot less because we didn’t get food. Lots of excuses were given, no responsibility taken.

Text: Good ambiance and service.
Would love togo for the garlic fried rice, they were lip smacking.
Gang Dang 5/5
Pad bai Gapao 4/5
Larp Gai 3/5 didn't like it cause it had a very strong taste of fish oil which left a dainty taste of spicy chicken.

Text: My original choice was closed for the public holiday so I ended up phoning Piyada Thai and I heard such a ruckus at the other end of the line I thought this place must be good as it’s clearly packed to the rafters.

Hubby almost went to the wrong spot for pickup as there are actually two restaurants in this chain (and I had inadvertently called one that was further away but couldn’t be bothered calling back to cancel given how noisy it was in there). Incidentally the woman kept repeating my ordered to me of prawn pad see ew as king prawn pad see ew and when I opened the container I understood why.

This was a seriously impressive dish. None of those tiny shrimp you often receive in a prawn noodle dish these were proper juicy plump prawns perfectly cooked and seven of them no less. The flavour of this was absolutely spot on too. My husbands choice was chicken pad Thai which he was also very pleased with. We have definitely found our new go to

Text: The best Thai food & value for money in Melbourne. You can have Aussie Thai or if you want authentic Thai (70% less sugar) but a little more spicy that’s also excellent. Fantastic service & many dishes are minimum 9 plus out of 10 👍👍

Text: Quaint B&B, with very attentive and helpful owners.
Standard hot made to order breakfast.
Rooms are cosy, each with a different themed decor.
The Arabian Nights room where we stayed has an extremely noisy bathroom ?vent fan, but this inconvenience is easily ignored in light of everything else.
The view was a bit disappointing though, especially not being able to use the balcony due to chilli breeze.

Text: Booked this place for my parents, was looking forward to them having a nice weekend away together. It was unfortunate hearing back that the house was unbearably cold..and the hospitality could have been a bit better. My parents remarks were " felt like we were renting a room in a house" they did mention the house and great location, butba little disappointing.

Text: I bought a visit as a gift to my parents, they decided to leave the B&B. The hosts would not allow them to adjust temperature on the air con unit, and the bed was squeaky and uncomfortable. In any case they had to leave and go elsewhere they didnt feel comfortable staying there.

Text: What a beautiful location, the views are unreal, and you can see the sunset over the bay from the balcony upstairs. Modern rooms, uncluttered and clean, and the owners are very friendly. Photos on the website don't do it justice, it's quite nice.

Text: Usually good tasty food, today they cheaped out though and only gave a half portion. I ask for meals with no cabbage and no onion so maybe they didn't bother adding to make up for it. Really disappointing as it would be obvious to whoever put it in the containers that something is wrong, they just didn't care.

Text: Have been going to this restaurant for takeaway for years. Best Thai in the area..hadn't been for a little while ...but ordered tonight. I could not believe how small the serving was. Ordered Red Curry Chicken. Literally only 5 pieces of chicken in the serve. The serve was 30% the size of what I had always received....?

Text: We have used this restaurant many times in the past and has been a favourite place to order a treat at the weekend . Unfortunately tonight’s meal fell way short of our expectations. The chicken dish though tasty was incredibly small. The Pad Thai was flavourless. The pork belly and broccolini was tasty. Such a shame as  we probably won’t order from here again.
