Text: We recently stayed at this wonderful hotel and from the time that I booked with Claudia , I had a feeling that our stay was going to be special. The staff are professional, and ready to assist you with what you need.
We had a room overlooking the beach and from the moment we walked into the room, we knew that the  view and room was going to add to our experience. It was decorated with beach decor and the special treat on arrival was a lovely touch and one we enjoyed.
We dined at the Bazaar restaurant one evening and given that I am not a great fan of a buffet, we did enjoy, especially our 12 year old Grandson. We had drinks at Stingray- which once again was enjoyable and cocktails out on the lawn area- how good is that?
The pool and surrounds are beautiful.
There is only one place for us to stay, if we are back to the Gold Coast. Thank-you Claudia.

Text: Delightful! The QT Hotel in Gold Coast exceeded all my expectations with its unique blend of modern art deco style and vibrant ambiance. The rooms are not only visually stunning but also incredibly comfortable, making it a joy to stay in.

One of the standout features is the well-stocked mini bar, a rare find in hotels these days, offering a fantastic selection worth raiding. The pool area is nothing short of exquisite ‚Äì the photos truly speak for themselves, but the real experience is even better. The pristine waters and stylish surroundings create a perfect oasis for relaxation.

The hotel's attention to detail and commitment to providing a luxurious experience make it a top choice for anyone visiting the Gold Coast. From the chic decor to the impeccable amenities, every aspect of the QT Hotel is designed to offer an unforgettable stay. Highly recommended for a blend of comfort, style, and sophistication.

Text: We stayed for 3 days 2 nights at QT Gold Coast. The customer service was top notch (10/10!). The staff was incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to assist us with big smiles - which is honestly a breath of fresh air in the hospitality industry these days. Spacious and stylish room with ocean view. Prime location ‚Äì Just steps away from the beach and a short walk to the Esplanade. Clean room, comfortable bed. They even surprised us with a sweet anniversary treat and a personalized message - such a personal and thoughtful touch!
Now, there were a couple of tiny things: the bathroom vanity was a bit on the small side, especially with the shelf above it. Made it awkward to use basin for my tall husband! the buffet breakfast, while good, felt a little pricey for what we got on our first morning. We ended up exploring a cafe nearby the second day, which was way more economical with more options.

Overall, though, the stay was amazing and we'll definitely be back!

Text: Thank you QT Gold Coast for a wonderful stay! The rooms are amazing, the staff are so friendly and helpful. I left a very sentimental piece of jewellery in our room when we checked out, the hotel staff found it and put it in their safe until I could collect it. Unlike many other hotel stays where things you leave behind go missing, QT proved to be honest, accomodating and exceptional in their customer service. Can't recommend highly enough! We will be back! :)

The breakfast buffet was a feast of high-quality offerings, catering to every taste. Downstairs, Driftwood Social Dining was a highlight, with its scenic charm and relaxing atmosphere perfect for dining and unwinding. I highly recommend Vibe Hotel for its picturesque setting, superb breakfast selection, and the blissful ambiance of Driftwood Social Dining.

However when I had a week of stay at the hotel, I noticed at days my room was not prepared and I had to request at the reception. I also experienced bed bugs during my stay at the hotel. I would never stay at the hotel with such discomfort towards the price you pay for your stay. Moreover if you are looking to obtain points towards your hotel stay please forget about that. I hope the hotel brings some genuine rewards and quality to please customers towards their stay.

Huge thanks to Daniel, Ada and Sophie for going above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. The only hiccup was during my spa time at 10:30am on Monday, when a staff member dropped some chemicals without explanation, I felt alarmed and decided to leave the spa. It was quite rude, although I understand the situation. However, despite this minor inconvenience, the overall experience was fantastic.

The Patio was a good finishing touch, and the free snacks/water/milk provided were amazing. Was able to park our car a few hours after our check out time. Came in early and said our room were not ready yet but they communicated to us straight after our room is ready to be checked in. Heard a few noises at night here and there but was so tired after a long day, manageable to sleep. Stayed from Monday - Thursday if that helps. In the heart of Surfers and very close to the beach.

(Scott thank you so much for the amazing service) In the meantime we were sent a complimentary starter which was delicious! When our steak came out again it was cooked to perfection and with complimentary sauces. It was the best steak we had ever had. And we were more than happy to wait an extra 10 minutes. Will absolutely be back can not  fault our experience. Cocktails were equally as delicious!

I would love to visit another time to give it this place a go again because the Japanese Wagyu was phenomenal. Unfortunately, service missed parts of our orders but tried to make up for it by giving us more sauces which honestly we didn't really even touch. We appreciated the apology and the attempt though and understood the night was crazy busy. Oysters were great and the sides were decent.

Text: Every food served there is always great and I am a frequent customer of the place.

When I last visited with friends was last February, although our table was inside the restaurant there were many flies over meals - and it went into my wine glass twice ‚Ä¶. First time I asked to change the wine glass, but the restaurant staff removed the fly from the glass and brought the same glass with same wine back to the table. Yes it was from a bottle purchased but I was hoping they would re serve wine or at least offer a glass of another red, a little disappointed on seeing the staff act, that a bug in your drink is acceptable to be re-served in this type of fine restaurant.

Then second one went into it on my second glass ‚Ä¶. I gave up üòÖ

Except these incidents at the time we had another spectacular dining experience there, steak was cooked perfectly as asked and I will sure go back again.

Text: Having had rather mixed experiences here over the past 10 or so years, I was again preparing to be underwhelmed. So the 30 minute wait to be shown to our table met those expectations and then... Philippe arrived. What followed was a very schmick level of service for the entire evening. Well versed in the wine list and also very considerate of my older parents, he walked and talked us through the huge range of steak offerings. After a mouthwatering 'show and tell' of the premium wagyu sharing style cuts we made our decision, the wine was flowing and our evening just got better and better. The wagyu rib on the bone was absolutely stunning, the suggested medium cooking allowed the fat to melt and the side of tenderloin, maybe a little overdone, gave us a tender and soft alternative to the rich and maillard encrusted wagyu. Very good wine list with some hidden little gems (my secret, sorry) and we finished with some creative and visually beautiful desserts. Bravo Moo Moo, and thank you Philippe for a fabulous evening at table no.4, in the quieter section for us older folks!

Text: Attended their lovely breakfast buffet on the morning of the 02/07/2024 to which we were not greeted and instead experienced rude customer service. The worker at the front desk (Lesley) was rude and did not talk to us properly. We had a big group of 13 (9 adults & 4 kids) on this busy morning but that does not excuse the behavior we experienced. She popped the adults and kids through separately despite us wanting to pay one bill and did not give a reason to why. When we asked, she wouldn‚Äôt give us a proper explanation and brushed it off. She barely spoke to us and projected an aggressive and annoyed tone and body language despite us waiting patiently. The family behind us was Australia to which she greeted with a smile on her face and conversed with ever so nicely so i know she was capable of good customer service but chooses who she displays that too (we are filipino.) We were very disappointed as it was my grandpas birthday we were celebrating. Additionally when we got inside the buffet, finding a seat was very disorganized, we were a large group and did not mind having to push tables together however in doing so we stayed in the far corner, not disrupting anyone or the environment around us. The staff on the floor had no business giving us looks and judging us from afar, especially since we were doing their job for them. Terrible morning. Compliments to the head chef who was very nice and accommodating, the food was incredible too.

Text: Buyer beware! We had booked a 3 night stay, at a cost of $1300 to attend a family wedding. We took the option of no cancellation ,or changes, which was fair enough as we had no intention of not attending our nephews wedding. Unfortunately, our son had to be flown to Sydney for an emergency operation 2 days before book in. I rang the hotel asap and explained ,why we couldn't use the booking. I didn't want a refund, just a credit to use at another time, offered to pay any difference in price. The receptionist Michelle said it wasn't possible. I asked surely in exceptional circumstances there could be some leeway, especially when I was willing to pay extra. She said she would get management to send me an email. 3 weeks later still waiting . Obviously customer service isn't their strong point . I would recommend staying elsewhere, plenty of options and cheaper.
P.S. I had no problem getting credits from airlines etc

Text: I had a delightful stay at the Star Casino. The receptionists were exceptionally professional and even added an additional $200 birthday credit to my Platinum Star Rewards card. I had booked two complimentary rooms for two nights using my Platinum status. I treated my friends to lunch and dinner and relaxed in the pool and spa area.

The gaming area and the perks of unlimited free alcohol and mixers in the Gold Lounge were particularly enjoyable. I highly recommend staying here. Table games start with a $15 buy-in and can go up to a $50 minimum on the lower floor. Private rooms are available for Gold or higher status members upstairs, with minimum bet sizes around $50,000. There is also a dedicated Gold Lounge area and high-limit slots. Most table games use card shufflers and typically feature eight decks.

Text: I've been eating here for a number of years now knowing it's the best Indian on the Coast, but I decided it was a must to post a review after my experience tonight. I've recently found out I'm dairy intolerant. I didnt feel like cooking so we decided to go out for tea, but after a lot of driving and feeling really unenthusiastic about no prospects, my partner remembered the Indian we always get is vegan!
They were able to add chicken to the vegan sauce - and its the best meal I've eaten since becoming dairy free. Tasted JUST like butter chicken - was perfectly creamy, and was a generous serving. Staff were kind and attentive and the food came out so quickly. The restaurant smelt divine and there was light Indian music in the background setting the atmosphere. Also, for those who are plus size, the restaurant has sturdy chairs.
11/10 and always consistent, I highly recommend.

It‚Äôs a small restaurant but has a nice ambience. Had the samosa chaat to start with and it was really flavourful and generously portioned. Followed that with the Malai Kofta which was also great. We took away what we could not eat. Service was quick and friendly. Will definitely return.

I knew what I was doing, I don‚Äôt live under a wet rock and I got what I asked for. I got cheap Mexican food from a chain restaurant. But guys‚Ä¶ did you have to chuck the veiny skin of a red onion in my chicken bowl? When I pulled it out of my mouth I got a really big fright‚ÄîI thought it was the wing of a butterfly.

Apart from that - at least half the chicken was reso nice, and once I was done my tummy was full, so there is that. Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers.

It was a week day night and there were only 2 groups other than us. Adding to this, the bowl looked so sad and it didn‚Äôt look pretty at all. Chicken was burnt. It tasted burnt. Not edible.

Text: So glad that we made a decision to try out this resort. Agreed with some reviews that some rooms are yet to be updated. Our room did look tired and dated however it was super clean and the bed was comfy!!!

In terms of how family friendly this resort is I don‚Äôt think I have to describe much‚Ä¶
The water park - younger kids can spend half a day there
Rock climbing and ice skating and laser tag - these are all on site, so fun and convenient
My girl particularly liked the hair braiding experience a lot.
Not to mention the kids club - one free session per day was truly a bonus for us as parents.

However what made our trip the most memorable was truly customer service.
We indeed could not believe how clean the place was - even for the indoor playground beside the reception, they do cleaning two times a day! Outside the room - everywhere was clean and was so well-maintained.
Apart from the cleanliness, the exceptional service provided by some of the staff members like Roy and the guy who was in charge of many activities like rock-climbing and laser tag‚Ä¶ we appreciated it very much. Their smiles and their enthusiasm have made our stay so comfortable and enjoyable.

Overall - we enjoyed the stay very much.

The restaurants on site were great - the pizza was especially amazing. Staff were all friendly and seemed like they actually enjoyed being there which we appreciated. We didn't use the kids club but it was nice that it was there as an option and other guests told us that their kids loved it. The arcade was fun downstairs. My daughter loved getting her hair braided like a mermaid and doesn't want to take it out! We stayed for 2 nights and got offered complimentary late checkout at 4pm which was so nice - I have never had that at any hotel I have stayed at.
There were several things we didn't get a chance to try like the carousel and ice skating rink so we will be back!
You don't need to leave the resort - everything is there  - and Surfers Paradise is pretty run down and not that exciting to be honest.
Highly recommend for families.

Text: I decided to treat myself to a weekend getaway at this place into the mountains to be away from the city. BEST DECISION I EVER MADE!! I stayed in one of the rooms called 'The Vista's' and the room was gorgeous. Perfect small studio apartment with outdoor bathroom, which they provided Robes and Slippers to use!! [ Loved that ] Along with a small outdoor veranda with a beautiful view of the Cedar Creek. A perfect location to be one with nature and enjoy the scenery. The Room was well presented, the cleanliness was outstanding, the whole room smelt nice and fresh, PLUS they made a customized welcome card with my name on it just made the whole room just that extra welcoming and giving the experience a personalized touch.

The food was fantastic, I purchased one of their Fruit Platters to treat myself. It was well presented; fresh produce and the hospitality service was excellent. Not to mention the housekeeping staff were so lovely! First time they serviced my room, I returned with everything restocked and with some extra kitchen items [ Tim Tam's and biscuits ]. The second time I was greeted by one of their lovely staff members, I think her name was Ashleigh. The one with the glasses. She was so nice and very lovely to deal with, she even provided me with extra bathroom linen as per my request.

Overall, my stay at this place was excellent. Absolutely worth going to if you want to get away from the busy city lifestyle for a quick quiet getaway. I will be returning to this place when I can do so.

We were told they features different country‚Äôs cuisine on a monthly basis, and we happened to get USA the night we were there.  The staff were pleasant and helpful, and quite efficient at clearing used plates etc as well. Our family with very young children were accommodated easily and a highchair provided. Would recommend booking though as this place seems to be popular, and for good reason. They seafood was tasty, salads and cold cuts were very nice (although the cheese section lacked proper cheese knives). So much variety in the Asian food area as well.  The dessert selections are plentiful and soft serve if you‚Äôre game. The tea and coffee station was tucked over in a corner and I missed it unfortunately as I would have liked some before our trip home.

However, the service was close to zero. It took so long for our drinks to arrive even though there were only 2-3 tables when we ordered our drinks. Secondly, no one came to our table to collect our plates and some tables have the plates piled up and so unpleasant to eat with plates full on the table! This is buffet dining, there should be someone there to clear our plates all the time. Only till half way through our lunch, then the staff started coming to clear our table. Some of them were not very friendly!

The rump was quite tough and definitely not medium rare as ordered, had quite a bit of gristle too. The brisket sandwich had plenty of brisket but wasn't very flavourful and the sandwich was overall very dry. The ribs were pretty good but the accompanying slaw and sauce was not.

None of us finished our meals.
Not likely to return for food.

Nice venue with pleasant staff and service though and free pool tables on Sundays.

Yeah servos don't turn over a lot of sugar.
But today I went to buy a lighter and when I was at the register I felt like a sweet treat, I picked up the boost bars I had been watching over the last six to eight months fading in the sun from the front window and said these are fading but I'll have this one under it. The worker told me that no, this was a new flavour and was meant to look like that. Even though none of the rest looked like the top ones. As I was leaving someone asked about pies and she said they were ready, even though the display was empty, they said they would like a plain with sauce she said it won't be ready for 20 mins. I'll be going to seven eleven even though they are two blocks away. This place is due as.
Edited to say the staff on weekday mornings who make coffee are great.

Fuel prices like all BPs reflect the stranglehold large companies have on fuel prices in Australia and cheaper priced fuel is available from smaller chain fuel spots nearby.

Text: Had a very bad experience with customer service it was a male, dark skin and hair, when went to pay my petrol and I did also look up for the promotion of energy drinks. He was just talking with the other staff and when I did pay my beverage he changed me out of the promotion and told me after I paid it was not included in the promotion, I told him that he could inform me before pay and he told me it was up to me to check the product properly. I work with customers service myself and would never try to make money on the top of a customer in a bad way like that and also give that kind of answer but maybe try to help guests to have better options and service to make sure that people can come back. It was today around 4:46pm management should check cameras more often.

Text: I live literally across the road from this petrol station and every Sunday morning my partner and I are woken up by what I can only assume is music! Who ever is playing this dreadful sound plz for the love of god turn it down. There is no need to have music playing that loud at a petrol station on a Sunday morning. Ur choice of music is terrible. Please have some consideration for the ppl who live across from you that have no choice but to listen to it.

Text: The odd thing about this gas station is you will go in there one day and get a great coffee.  Then go back another day get exactly the same coffee made the same way, and it tastes like a cup of hot sick!!   And on a side note. If you sell steak bacon and cheese pies.... try putting bacon and cheese in them!!!!  And don't cook them till the pastry is as hard as a gingernut biscuit!!!  I'll pay your outrageous prices but not if your going to sell me dog food!!!

Then walking to my car a patron called at me from the door to come back I asked what for. She said cashier wants you.  After walking back in i asked whats the problem she asked again what pump were you at. I replied and she said oh ok. How Embarrassing. Not good service. I had already PAID. I will never return again. No appology. That is not good public relations. Don't bother filling up there.

Text: As someone who works in hospo, the kids working this specific store need their heads pulled in by management. Customer service was absolutely disgusting, two girls and a boy working - all poorly kept. Hand hygiene and food safety was very bad. Girls were touching hair with gloves without changing them, then touching salads and meats. They were yelling from across the bench to each other about completely work inappropriate topics while serving us and then later eating chips in front of other customers. They were complaining about working in earshot. They were nice girls but management needs to seriously correct this behaviour as the place seems very unprofessional, poorly run and quite ratchet to put it simply. Not sure if this behaviour is understood as acceptable but as 3 girls who work in hospitality this was very sad.

Other than that guy, it‚Äôs great and all and I see this Canadian girl who works there and the manager they were lovely. I get a six inch meatball sub on white bread with mozzarella cheese double toasted and have salt on there, 3 cookies, one m&m, one regular choc chip and one double choc chip. Sometimes I get a salad bowl and I like to stay healthy at times. I do miss this chick who used to work there with purple hair named Danny I think, I like her a lot and she‚Äôs so sweet and lovely. I would say it‚Äôs good, but not da best, due to some mediocre staff.

A tiny wait to have my sub made with just 1 customer ahead of me. The staff member was attentive and knew her product. My sub was fresh and exactly as I ordered. My request for extra sauce or a change in anything didn‚Äôt seem a problem. A large online order came in with customers waiting and it was all taken in the stride without any stress. An enjoyable experience for a subway! 3 stars on the atmosphere due to the lack of seating to eat the sub. Just one table with 2 seats, utilising the outside seating would have been handy.

It was very hot outside today so I decided to finish of the rest of my hashbrown inside in the air con. I didn't have anything else from McDonald's with me either. I explained to the worker sorry it's hot outside and I will be ordering something. Two chomps later and she says to me if you're eating McDonald's in here get outside. After I finished it I said to her "You know after what I just explained to you and after what you just said to me I will never set foot in your store again." And then unbelievably she actually comes out of the store to shout whatever she was saying at me. WOW seriously!!!
I did not use any obcene language either just saying.

This is not the type of worker I would have working for me. I would loose A LOT of business!

I have been to this Subway more times than I can count and every. single. time. it has honestly been perfect, absolutely five stars!

I get the same thing every time so it‚Äôs easy for me to be nit picky if something is off, but it never is and it doesn‚Äôt matter who makes it, the whole team are wonderful and make my sub perfect every single time! And I see all the other people‚Äôs subs being made next to me as well as it‚Äôs normally lunch rush and very busy, and they always take care and make everyone‚Äôs sandwich neatly and with heaps of fillings.

Everyone who works there is always lovely and pleasant, they‚Äôre also so damn quick as well I barely spend any of my lunch break waiting, and even though they‚Äôre fast it‚Äôs always packed neatly and made with care. Even when they‚Äôre getting slammed they‚Äôre always so friendly and always say hi!

This is my favourite Subway ever, always quick, always fresh and always wrapped up perfectly and never packed messy or anything, thank you so much for looking after my lunch for so many of my shifts, you guys get me through my work day I appreciate you :)

Text: I haven't eaten at Subway again after a "Sandwich artist" at this store, used their gloved hand to dig around in the coin drawer for change and then put it straight into the salads.. Yuck! Does he leave the gloves on when going to the bathroom as well? Hygiene training should be compulsory. It was quiet, so they could have finished making the sandwich and then sorted money but in an effort to get back to sitting around quicker, they wanted to save 30 seconds by doing it while it was in the toaster oven.. maybe they are trained to do that...? But not to use food serving gloves for dirty money and fresh food.

Text: I came here today with a few people and a manager was yelling at a customer threatening to throw him out of the store because the customer was asking for salad on his Subway and the manager got all upset because she thought the customer was telling her how to do he job. I won't be returning to this store after this.

I know you guys are under new ownership and management but I would suggest the franchise owners gets a better manager.

Text: Honestly the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had at a subway restaurant. 2 workers on.  Female and male. Female served me. She was extremely rude from the get go. Ratios completely off, complete attitude to the point I had to pull her up and request a little less attitude. No bags were given, subs made poorly and wrapped extremely poorly, no napkins. For two toasted subways they were completely soggy and cold I don‚Äôt know how that happens on a 5 minute drive home. Subway isn‚Äôt cheap anymore and for the price you pay you expect to get what you pay for.

Text: Today between 1:30-2:30 Pm, I went to subway with my friend, we ordered a foot long, half chicken and half veggie patty. After it got ready and the person who was serving us did not write which one is which, veggie patty and which one is chicken. She should have at least written it on top of the sub and mention veggie patty. Later, I asked her which one is veggie and which one is chicken, and then she said let me check, and she opened one of the sub and closed it back and told me this is a veggie patty. And she also did write VP on the paper wrap which is used to cover the sub. Now when I got home and started eating the sub which mention VP(Veggie Patty) and when I had it, my friend realised it that it‚Äôs not veggie it‚Äôs a chicken one. So my concern is after making a mistake and then after I realised and told the staff to write it for me and then she opened it and also wrote the wrong after even looking at the sub. Being a pure vegetarian, this is really a bad experience from the staff at Subway Arundel, I did let it go for once, but later I realised I should let people know so it doesn‚Äôt happen with anyone else.

I work in hospitality sector and I understand subway is a fast food chain, but getting almost such a poor service is not acceptable.
I request the manager to please over look this situation, check the camera for more evidence, the date today is 04/08/2024.
Times: Between 1:00-2:30 Pm.

Please train your staff, or change your staff, I‚Äôm still letting go off this thing, but it could have been a major problem.

the  platter and it had half  wraps in it and proberly 10 all up and i said this is no way this is going to feed 22 people, and this is not worth $74 are you joking, then she said have  you paid i said yes I showed you the receipt when I came in so I had to get it out and she said oh I didn't read it properly....oh the guy who took my order wrote it all down he was great, can the young lady not read???

I was in shock and appalled by the service , how can you not have a platter ready when it states pick up friday 5pm and what you have ordered.

A very average burger and an even more average Parmi, unfortunately. Onion rings were top-notch, though.
But it's a great place to smash down some beers, relax with family or friends, and just enjoy the views if you can get a table that overlooks the beach. But even seated at the high tables, at least you overlook the park. It's always fresh and breezy here as well. Service is incredibly warm and hospitable. Prices are typical of Broadbeach.

My husband and I enjoyed the food but my mum...87... didn't enjoy the pizza. It was very thin, burnt on the bottom on some slices.  She couldn't pick it up to eat as it just drooped. We also had some cakes which were delicious.

Text: Donto Sapporo has been a staple in the area for years, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. The consistent feedback and reviews I've heard from others were spot-on. Having visited a couple of times, I can confidently say this place never disappoints.

The sushi platter, hand roll platter, and sashimi are absolutely phenomenal. The moment these dishes appear in front of you, they are truly mouth-watering. The freshness is unparalleled, and for the first time, I understood what it means for sushi to "melt in your mouth." The tuna, in particular, was incredibly tender and flavorful.

A word to the wise: make sure you make a reservation for Saturday if you're looking forward to their sushi, sashimi, or any specials, as these are only served with a reservation and it also get superbly busy. The outdoor seating is also a wonderful feature, especially for those dining with pets. It‚Äôs dog-friendly, and they even prepared an amazing bowl for my fur baby, showing just how welcoming and accommodating their service is.

During one of my visits, I dined alone with my dog. The waitress went above and beyond, helping me set up everything outdoor and even bringing the payment machine out to me so I didn‚Äôt have to leave my fur baby unattended. The service here is truly top-notch.

Overall, Donto Sapporo offers a fantastic dining experience with exceptional food and excellent service. Highly recommended!

I'm normally really patient and generous about food service as I'm also working in hospitality industry so long, but this place definitely need to improve their service. it was really disappointed as I got huge impression after eating entree. huge delay service without any checking, or notification let me down so much.

Text: A Delightful Culinary Experience

My recent visit to Donto Sapporo for lunch marked my second delightful experience at this Japanese restaurant. Once again, I was thoroughly impressed by the inviting atmosphere and, most notably, the exquisite food.

This time, I opted for the Sapporo bento, and it was nothing short of a culinary revelation. The bento offered a harmonious blend of flavors and a variety of dishes, making it a pleasure to sample different tastes that complemented each other beautifully. Each bite was a testament to the skill and care put into the preparation.

Given the quality and variety of the food, the price we paid felt like a steal. Donto Sapporo truly delivers on value for money, providing a dining experience that is both satisfying and memorable.

Without hesitation, I highly recommend Donto Sapporo to anyone looking for an authentic and enjoyable Japanese dining experience.

It was not really busy when we visited it on a Wednesday morning around 0910.

We thought it would be interesting to try their pancakes for breakfast.

- pancake egg Benedict with bacon $25
- Canadian Breakfast
2 buttermilk pancakes, whipped butter,
2 bacon rashers and 2 fried eggs. $24
- Dirty Chai Latte $5 mug
- Latte $5 mug

We waited for an hour for the pancakes to come.
We also saw some other guests were getting frustrated as well. Lucky we did not have things planned.
The drinks arrived after ~10 mins.

And the pancakes are highly priced. And the Benedict were disappointing.
Some of the staffs also showed poor attitudes of not wanting to interact with you/ take your orders‚Ä¶

I would only give it 1.5-2/5, mainly because of the designs and the coffees.

The man threw all the salads together as well as slapping the chicken on top, then proceeded to wrap the wrap against the grain of the strip and the strips were halved in the wrap, causing it not to wrap like a wrap normally should. Now, as soon as opened the wrapper, the whole wrap pretty much fell out of the bottom and i had to reassemble it myself which is totally unfair‚Ä¶i do not work for subway yet I felt the need to tell this boy how to wrap my wrap? I have attached a photo below that shows how i opened my subway. As soon as I picked it up, everything streamed out the bottom.

Some colleagues and I decided to visit Stingray Lounge at the QT on a Tuesday, and like many establishments on the GC/around the globe, the "Lounge" offers a Tacco Tuesday. We should have known based on the minimal and awkward seating left empty around the room, that this was not going to be enjoyable.

After finding a high table suitable to eat at and attempting to use a QR code to order, we soon found out this had been deactivated, and bar service was our only option (a non-issue). Our first stop was a round of drinks, quickly discovering the post mix guns weren't working, meaning all soft drinks sat warm on the bench and were cooled by ice in your glass. The watered down consistancy not overly enjoyable for the non alcohol drinkers (a small issue), and then it came to food.

Dry, tepid, and underwhelming would be the polite way to describe what was served.  After seeing the tacos prepared at what can only be described as the DJ booth, I'm concerned if this even meets FH&S regulations.

Attempting to serve food like 300g steak, glazed salmon, and pork belly and in what can really only be considered a bar seems a bit conflicting. A small renovation to accommodate suitable seating or menu refresh is required.
