Text: 1) We checked into our room and had a worker walk into our room unannounced, opened the door with his key and saw my husband standing there and said I need to come in to “lock the interconnecting door”. We looked and it was already locked. We raised it with Reception and all we got was sorry.
2) Car parking was terrible and full by time we arrived so evidently not enough parking. Ended up paying car park $10 overnight approx 200m down the road which was cheaper then hotel price.
3) We tried to phone reception and room service multiple times and could never get through to speak with someone.
4) Never any towels in pool area. First time we tried to call reception and nobody answered.
5) Our room key card did not work for the gym so husband didn’t use the gym.
6) We booked snow package which was good but booking for snow play itself was not clear at time of booking. Rooms a bit outdated but sufficient for what we needed. Location was good, central to everything. Restaurant dinner and buffet breakfast was good.

Text: The Novotel is very conveniently located in the centre of Canberra.  The public areas are nice and must have been fairly recently refreshed however the rooms and corridors were very dated.  There were a lot of stains on the carpets in the corridors and the design of the rooms was quite bizarre.   The bathroom was partly open plan with a glass partition to the bedroom- which was very badly positioned close to the bed.  In the middle of the night getting up for the loo I couldn't see it and bashed my face into it.  It is quite dangerous.
The parking is frustrating too.  It's expensive and there's not enough parking for the hotel so it's first come first served.- even if you've paid for parking - if you can't get in you have to speak to reception to get it removed from your bill.
Overall a disappointing experience - apart from location wouldn't recommend.  Better / nicer options slightly further out on Northbourne Avenue.    I understand from the new manager (who was very helpful) that it's going to be refurbished at some point.  Maybe after that it will be much better.

Text: Don’t expect to use there car park it’s so tight and hard to access they only have about 20 car spaces and it’s subject to availability if your planning on driving you need to park in a nearby car park and walk 10minutes away we found it pretty bizarre for a well known multi level hotel. The room itself was tiny and my door key broke twice during my stay, also the lifts are very old and small and you have to wait a while, first edition breakfast buffet was nice but other than that I wouldn’t say I would stay there again.

Text: Our stay at QT Hotel in Canberra was outstanding! The true test of a hotel's quality is how they handle things when they go wrong, and QT Hotel passed with flying colors. We experienced a minor issue during our stay, but the staff's prompt and efficient response turned it into a positive experience.

The team was incredibly professional and courteous, ensuring that the problem was resolved quickly and to our satisfaction. Their dedication to guest satisfaction was evident, and it made us feel valued and well taken care of.

Apart from the excellent service, the hotel itself is fantastic. The rooms are stylish and comfortable, the amenities are top-notch, and the overall ambiance is both chic and welcoming.

QT Hotel's commitment to exceptional service, especially in handling unexpected situations, makes it a standout choice. We highly recommend it and look forward to our next stay!

Text: This is one of the hardest reviews I have had to do. I would have given it his zero stars if not for the staff. The staff there are amazing. Really good. Nothing is too much trouble. The service is great. That’s where it ends sadly.

The hotel is appalling. So incredibly old and dirty. Oh dear me it’s so filthy I cannot begin to describe it. Truly terrible.

I moved rooms 3 times in the one night. The first room the heating did not work. It was -4deg overnight so it was cold.

They then moved me to another room. The new room was so filthy with mould on the ceilings, a terrible stench from the room and utterly dusty and dirty with stains on the bathroom floor and mould on all the ceilings. I ordered room service that was inedible.

I went to reception and they were very helpful and arranged another room. It was but marginally better.

Broken beds left outside my room in the hallway, and utterly old and incredibly dirty rooms.

I was there for 2 nights for a conference and that was 2 nights too long. I definitely would have stayed somewhere else had I have known what it was like.

Credit to the staff. They all do an amazing job.

It’s so very expensive for what it is. Breakfast was definitely not worth the price. Breakfast was around $40. See pics.

Unless they renovate or pull it down - do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else.  View from the room was a construction site.

I had dinner in the restaurant on the second night. It was better than the room service and  the staff,  as I said before, are just great.

That does not make up sadly for the appalling condition of the hotel.

Text: Having stayed in multiple QT hotels, I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the rooms compared to the other locations. Rooms are usually extremely lavish and quirky yet the QT Canberra felt more like an IBIS. The lobby sadly is the only real modern aspect to the hotel. There is also extensive and noisy construction going on outside which can be heard even with the balcony door closed.
The reception staff were wonderful which I very much appreciated.

Text: $365 a night no breakfast. Right next door to major build works. There is no where close to get brunch or the like as this hotel does not open for food until 12pm. The room is adequate but not stunning which is why I feel like this is a $160-$200 Max place as it is quite ordinary. Prices on the menu are not correct, there is an additional charge.

Pleasantly surprises with how good it was. Easy parking and close to everything. Gym is not much to ride home about. Attrium was a nice area to relax and have a drink. Very unique. Rooms were clean and well presented. Only dealt with staff during check in. No complaints there. Considering the price it was exceptional value and will be our first point of call next time we visit.

They had the private and luxurious wedding of their dreams here, and the stunning architecture, beautiful interior decorations, and gardens were nothing short of phenomenal. From beginning to end, the staff were exceptional at their job, and the ceremony and reception went seamlessly.

We used one of their spacious event spaces, which was just the right size for the entire guest list. There were several perfect spots for photo opportunities, both indoor and outdoor. It's truly a hotel made for special occasions, and I can't recommend it enough!

Text: First time staying here. I’ve had my baby shower, my 21st in the buffet area, my first wedding anniversary, my graduation etc. so in the last 35 plus years many memorable experiences. We stayed for the week end to have our 12 year wedding anniversary as a staycation. We have such a relaxing weekend. We had a tray of chocolates with happy anniversary when we arrived which was lovely. The atmosphere of the hotel I really loved. The bath tub was great, the bed was comfy and the room ever so spacious.
It was hard to get room service and ended going through front desk but the dessert was yum. We had breakfast included with our stay and we really enjoyed it.
If anything negative was that we had a dirty nappy left in the bin but it was dealt with straight away. And parking was far to walk to and from but the beautiful gardens make up for it. We will definitely be coming back, such a lovely place.

Text: Stayed here in Canberra on a deal that included a one-night stay, entry to the Ancient Egypt Exhibition, and a buffet breakfast. I must say, this experience exceeded all my expectations!

The staff were exceptional, going above and beyond for any request I had, and even those I didn't. They upgraded my room at check-in just because, which was a lovely surprise. My partner and I arrived in Canberra early, and they graciously allowed us to check in early at no extra cost – a rare and much-appreciated gesture compared to other hotels that charge for this benefit. Their overall attitude towards guests was genuinely delightful.

The only minor concern was the underground parking, which is quite small, especially when returning to the hotel around 8 PM on a Saturday night. We were very fortunate to find what seemed to be the last available spot. Despite paying for parking, I was unsure of what the alternative would be if the underground parking was full, as there didn't seem to be any backup options.

That small issue aside, everything else was brilliant. The staff were top-notch, the rooms were spacious and clean, and the buffet breakfast had everything you could ask for, including barista-made coffee. What else can I say? If you stay here, you WON'T be disappointed!

The carpets and bathrooms are showing their age but the fantastic service from all hotel staff make up for the other small things that could be improved. Special thanks to the Manager Owen for taking the time to show us the room before we booked and for being so courteous and polite. The breakfast was good, selection from the buffet was good and again, all staff at breakfast were friendly and helpful. Yes, we can see the hotel room fixtures are showing their age, but the pricing was competitive. Overall, an enjoyable stay at the Crowne Plaza Canberra.

The hotel is large and has big common areas with tables and seating.

The room had 2 double beds (not queen) which were comfortable, a desk and a chair, and a single seat. Not big, but fine with two small children.

The stay included buffet breakfast for 2, and kids under 5 were free. An extra $12 a day for a 7yo. The breakfast was the highlight of the hotel for the kids. Plenty of food to choose from.

The location is excellent, with so many shops and restaurants within walking distance.

This being stated location is good, close to the Dickson restaurant precinct, very quiet environment, staff helpful when we voiced our concerns however, there is no excuse for the extreme cigarette odour that we were confronted with. Now this experience is specific to room 104. On entry to this room we were “hit” with the stale smoke odour and, as we are, I suggest, typical older aussie’s we decided to tough it out and not make a fuss. WRONG decision, awake at 3.00am and found it necessary to open up outside door and turn on the air conditioner for any chance of sleep. Yes we were moved to room 106 when we complained, better but not perfect.We were in Canberra to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary and his experience took the edge if it somewhat.Smoker rooms are completely unacceptable.

Only drawback? It was impossible to get mobile data reception.  Unfeasible to write reports after a day's work.  The good news is there are several libraries open to 8pm within 15 mins drive where you can grab a desk and a reliable connection including National Library of Australia.

The light flickered in the bathroom in a creepy way, but I forgot to mention that until my last day.  The buffet breakfast for $25 was terrible.  Selection was poor, and quality was low.
The 2 major positives to me were a memory foam pillow and being so far from other parts of the city, which means that there isn't much light pollution, so you can get a great view of the sky.
I did feel safe here, and the young man at reception was very pleasant and helpful.

Text: I’ll start with the positives first. The staff were friendly and helpful. The water pressure is strong, the aircon works fine and the bedroom and bathroom was clean (but outdated). I tried the dinner room service and the food was tasty.

The hotel is outdated and in my opinion does not meet 4 star standards. I stayed here on a work trip and unfortunately was really disappointed. The internet drops in and out constantly and my door malfunctioned and was openable without a card (this was fixed later). Because it is outdated there is no security required to enter the hotel after hours, anyone can walk in and walk directly to your door (even after hours). I found this to be unsafe, paired with the multiple signs around the hotel about theft and break-ins left me feeling uneasy. The telephone for room service was broken in my room. The shower makes a loud screech when being used and the strangest thing was the tissue dispenser- it’s the type used in public restrooms and not toilet rolls - just something I’ve never seen in a hotel before. Although the bathroom was clean, it was so outdated it felt dirty e.g black grout.
I tried the buffet breakfast and for $25 it was okay..their coffee machine was broken when I was there and they had the usual breakfast items, I would recommend eating out for breakfast.
The hallway lights are automatic so at night the hallways look creepy, nothing wrong with that but it just added to the whole vibe of the hotel. The carpets were also stained and worn.
I was expecting certain things like slippers, toothbrush amenity or writing stationary in the room for a 4 star however they only provide the shower amenities. I won’t stay here again for the price which was $175 per night - you pay for what you get, but they shouldn’t be classified as 4 stars….

Text: My granddaughters and I had a fabulous week in the ACT using GCH as our base. We didn't use the bar or restaurant, but the fare looked quite acceptable. We also didn't use the pool as it was the middle of winter, though it looked beautiful.
The rooms are clean, very comfortable, big enough for the three of us (and sundry amusements the girls brought), and perfect for our week's holiday. The air conditioner was highly efficient in the cold of winter, the wifi was strong and easily accessed. The bathroom was fabulous; it was clean, well stocked, and big enough, but the shower ( ! ) was heavenly 🥰 I would book there on the strength of that alone (I'm probably also easily pleased).
The staff, especially the beautiful Philippino housekeeper, couldn't do enough to help. Thank you for that. Old ladies travelling with little kids are always very grateful for the extras 🥰
I was concerned about the distance from town, but it was actually perfect. Quiet, though on a main road and minutes from all we needed, we were perfectly placed to go absolutely everywhere.
The girls and I will be back. GCH is now our base for all our ACT stays.
Thank you from the three of us 🙋‍♀️👩‍🦳🙋💐

There was a very unpleasant smell in the entrance, throughout the hall way to the rooms. Room was very small, was not cleaned properly. There were tissues in the bedroom bin and the toilet bin already. The cups, glasses and the spoons were dirty. When I told the guy in reception about the cup, he was not interested in swapping. He was like oh ok bring the cup downstairs and I will swap it for you, seriously? Why did I pay $154 for? Never going back there again. The receptionist was rude.

Text: I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Adina Serviced Apartments during a business trip, which lasted about a week. The location is notably convenient, nestled close to the shopping center of Canberra, making it an ideal spot for those looking to explore the city's retail offerings. The premises were consistently clean and quiet, providing a peaceful retreat after a day's work.

Although the building and its design carry a certain vintage charm, they do appear a bit old and outdated. Despite this, the spaciousness and overall loveliness of the apartments more than compensate for the dated aesthetics.

On first impressions, the lobby didn’t look too bad but that’s probably it. The check in process took about 20 mins for no real reason.
Our room (704) has mould on the wall next to the bed, carpet looks filthy and the shower had a massive bunch of black hair sitting on the floor so it obviously wasn’t cleaned.
The beds are quite hard also.
Breakfast is very basic! It was very busy and the pancake machine was spitting out 1  pancake every couple of mins. Otherwise there was cereal, toast and a bit of fruit. I did not try the hot options but my family had and left most of it. All I can say is spend the extra $50 a night and stay somewhere better.

We called to get an upgrade and they brought an extension cord and power-board so we could charge our phones from kettle powerpoint on the other side of the room. We asked for an upgrade and we were told was it was the best room they had. Asked for a refund and left. Definitely try Abode apartments just up the road and much better, plus a lot cheaper.

Caitlin has always made me feel welcomed and was very good a paying attention to details. If it was not for Caitlin's amazing customer service, i would perhaps looked at a different accommodation for my recent trip. However because Caitlin has always been amazing to work with and she made the whole process seem less, i chose to stay where i felt comfortable.

Text: Not trendy but good value, given the very moderate price we paid. Staff were great.

Our room was basic but perfectly clean and adequate. However we were a bit disappointed that it was a bit compact and we only had a view of a fire escape. In hindsight, we should have paid more to get a courtyard room.

Despite the rather ordinary look of the bar and bistro, the food and service was very good. We had the daily specials on both nights of our stay....I wasn't expecting much but the meals were very good and excellent value. The kitchen staff do an amazing job.

Text: Mercure Canberra offers excellent service and clean, nicely decorated rooms. The location is great, close to the city. The building is old but charming and well-maintained. The only downside is the lack of a lift, which made carrying luggage up the stairs a bit challenging. Despite this, the outstanding customer service makes up for it. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Canberra.

Text: We love this hotel and try and stay here every time we visit Canberra. The rooms are spacious and feel homely with warm colours and decor. The loft rooms are our favourite as they provide great space for a young family of four. Breakfast was sumptuous as always, and there was plenty of it given how busy it was both mornings. Though I would say the coffee machine was sub-par and neither of us even bothered to grab one on the second morning as we couldn't drink them the first day. The sofa bed could do with replacement due to the mattress sagging terribly but it was fine for small children. We will certainly be back again.

The location is perfect, right in civic, moments walk from so many great pubs and restaurants and public transport. The place was clean and quiet. Hot tip: the lift is a bit noisy and the beds a little hard (for me personally), but it's comfortable and you can choose from various pillows. I would recommend Quest for a longer stay if you have business in town, I was happy there.

The staff are apologetic and say that can’t do anything about it, but that doesn’t wash with me. And I’ll preempt the ridiculous robot reply I’ll receive and many others have, stick it! You clearly don’t care about your customers and are greedy a-holes. Let’s see what response I get. I had an almost 10 hour drive the next day so thanks for nothing. Be warned, don’t stay here!

Text: Our family trip to Canberra wouldn't have been the same without our stay at Hotel Realm! It was absolutely perfect for us with young kids. They had a blast splashing around in the heated pool and spa, and my husband and I enjoyed the steam room, and sauna. The buffet breakfast was average (but a win with the kids!), and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. The family room was amazing (2 bedrooms) - spacious, comfortable, and clean. The kitchen had a microwave, fridge, dishwasher, and washer/dryer, which was frequently used! The bathroom was big too, and the kids loved the jetted bathtub. Parking was affordable at $15 a night, which is cheap coming from Sydney! Honestly, we couldn't find a single fault with Hotel Realm. It's luxurious yet surprisingly family-friendly and well-priced. We highly recommend it!

Text: We recently held our wedding at Hotel Realm and were thrilled with almost every aspect of our experience. The venue is absolutely beautiful, with a grand ballroom that provided an elegant and spacious setting for our reception. The staff were incredibly professional, attentive, and ensured that our special day went off without a hitch. From the delicious food to the luxurious accommodations, our guests were consistently impressed.

However, we did encounter an unexpected issue regarding the use of a dry ice smoke machine during our reception. The hotel wanted to charge us over $500 to isolate the smoke alarm in the ballroom due to concerns it might be triggered by the dry ice. Given that dry ice smoke only rises to hip level and the ballroom ceiling is over two stories high, we felt this charge was unnecessary and a bit excessive. Furthermore, we found no information online suggesting that dry ice smoke could set off a fire alarm.

Despite this minor setback, our overall experience at Hotel Realm was fantastic. The venue’s beauty and the exceptional service provided by the staff truly made our wedding day unforgettable. We highly recommend Hotel Realm for anyone looking for a stunning and well-managed venue for their special occasion.

Thank you, Hotel Realm, for making our wedding day so memorable, even with the small hiccup regarding the smoke alarm.

The bathroom was extremely clean, though a bit dated, but it had an excellent water pressure shower. The whisper-quiet air-conditioning unit made the room warm, cozy, and easy to fall asleep in.

However, there were some negatives. There was a construction site directly outside our window, and jackhammering commenced at 7:00 AM both mornings we stayed. If I had been staying on business, it probably wouldn’t have been a problem, but since I was taking time off specifically to relax and sleep in, it was not suitable. If I had known about the construction, I wouldn’t have booked this hotel.

The shower was Terrible due to going from boiling to freezing over and over the whole time I was in it that night and in the morning! When I went and told the receptionist she said she would have to get that looked at and apologized then went to the room to check over the condition before coming back and saying she could smell remnants of smoke and I wasnt getting my full deposit back, which I needed to get home.(guessing this happens to a lot of their customers). Eventually she called the manager and they changed their mind and gave me my money. Overall I would never recommend this place to anyone and definitely will never go there again.

However the cleanliness could be better and on the website it looked modern but in reality its not a modern apartment. The swimming pool and gym felt like you were entering a dungeon and to get to the gym you had to go pass the swimming pool. The windows were closed and just seemed like there was no air to breath in the little space. Breakfast options were great. So for long term stay is a good option. For one or two nights I would spend a little bit more for somewhere more cleaner and modern.

The service from the front staff is absolutely poor( do not want to mention the person's name).
I have been staying always in Accor hotels whenever I travel thinking about the service they used to provide but next time onwards I will be thinking on this before any booking is done.
-> As a customer we expect the television in the rooms to be fully setup with all the recent apps and giving a ridiculous reason of refurbishment is not the right answer.
->When a customer gives a feedback try to accept it and move on rather arguing with lame reasons which is not at all acceptable.
-> Breakfast is average.
-> Gyms needs to refurb high time as the equipments have rust coming out.

Positives are the location and the room with some view for a bigger family (2 bedroom apartment).

I hope atleast someone from the senior management will look into this rather giving a standard auto response.

Spent 12 hours driving down from Queensland only to discover the parking complex is tiny and absolutely does not fit the number of guests' cars. I spent at least 20 minutes circling around the blocks trying to find any kind of parking. There was nothing. Only by a sheer miracle did someone finally leave the car park and I could park into the itty bitty space that barely fit my small car.

As far as the room goes, we get what we paid $110 a night for. It's clean, but kinda small. Clearly some old features that have been renovated around, and a toilet paper holder that doesn't hold the toilet paper. It's passable, but the non-existent parking left a sour taste as soon as we arrived. There was no indication that parking would be such a hassle on their website.

All in all, a pretty terrible start to our honeymoon, and I wouldn't bother staying here at all.

- the toilet roll holder was virtually non-existent
- the shower water would just randomly go very hot and cold, making in an unpleasant experience where I burnt myself many times.

Text: Our recent stay at the Madison Hotel and Suites Executive Apartment Hotel in Canberra was far from satisfactory. Several issues marred what should have been a comfortable and enjoyable stay. We weren’t even able to stay 1 night of what was going to be an extended stay celebratory trip of our wedding anniversary.

Firstly, upon entering our room, we immediately noticed a strong scent. This, combined with the uncleanliness of the room, including food on the floor and a dirty sock in the cupboard, set a disappointing tone for our stay.

The balcony door was a cause for concern as it was left unlocked, compromising our sense of security. Additionally, the handle was very loose and random holes on the floor, added to our worries about safety.

The lounge cushions and the bathroom were not up to standard. The cushions were visibly dirty, and the bathroom counter had hair on it that we had to clean ourselves before feeling comfortable using the facilities.

To compound matters, the hotel's WiFi was unreliable, failing to recognize or connect to our devices unless we were in the reception area. Additionally, the poor phone signal made it difficult to even get a 3G/4G connection.

We appreciate and are grateful that the hotel were able to provide us with a refund. The reception staff was also very nice, helped as best he could and gave great recommendations for food in the area 👏

Overall, our experience at the Madison Hotel and Suites Executive Apartment Hotel fell short of expectations. We hope that these issues can be addressed to improve the experience for future guests.

When the agent made the request, they rejected it. I am going to make a formal claim against them.

We resolved everything at the reception, and I took a photo showing the booking will be canceled before I entered my room. After leaving the hotel they made it hard and they want me to inform everyone—the third party, the hotel manager, the website, etc.—but this should have been enough when handled at the reception.

If you request to have a kitchenette then you could have one without any additional cost but you need to make the request. Everything is provided including soap, utensils, sponge etc.
Shampoo, conditioner are provided.
Great value, worth your money.
It is not noisy and you don’t hear your neighbour.
Receptionist is open late and they are all very nice and helpful including the cleaning lady.

The only con is: the mattress, it needs to be better. When partner is moving you feel it and it is not so restful sleeping on it.

On check in, the receptionist informed me the sauna was not working. I asked when it would be fixed, to which I was told "no idea, depends on if "they" want to get it fixed, we need an electrician... ", receptionist shrugs. Ahhhh, what? If an amenity is broken, get it fixed ASAP, and the "we need an electrician" comment doesn't mean it's too hard: get on the phone and get a sparky in. Pretty simple, but an indicator of the mangement's attitude towards guests. Not a good start.

I get to the room, and the place is dirty. The floors don't look like they get vaccumed, with dusty patches where ever there is low foot traffic, dust balls, dead insects and food and dirt and stuff along the corners/skirting of all the carpeted areas. The sheets on the single beds (in a two bedroom apartment) also dusty, and had brown marks on them that looked like they'd been slept in and then remade. No floor mat for the bathroom.

Dryer stopped working, it wouldn't spin, and one of the transition covers on the floor (where carpet and tiles meet) was loose and came away when ever it was stepped on.

I called the receptionist after I started discovering all of this, and he promised the issues raised would be resolved (sheets and dirty carpets at that time) and would personally check it after he spoke to the cleaning staff. I got back to the apartment after work, and guess what? The sheets got changed but the floors didn't get vacuumed/cleaned. I went down to reception and asked him come up to the room to check for himself, which he said he'd "done", but obviously he hadn't because he told me everything had been vacuumed/cleaned. When in the room, the transition cover came off, and I said "that needs to get fixed" but it didn't whilst I stayed there (for another week). I pointed out what I had been talking about: dead insects, dust balls/bunnies, food, etc. He took photos, promised it would be resolved the next day and was again "very sorry".

It never got cleaned, and I stopped asking - two complaints should be enough. If the corners of the rooms were dusty, the skirting near the bed/behind the bedside tables were covered in layers of the stuff - it looked like it hadn't been wiped down in years. I ended up wiping down the fly screens with some wet ones and they were black from an obvious lack of cleaning.

A dusty, dirty apartment. The outdoor pool was also dirty, I also asked the receptionist about its cleanliness when we walking to the apartment - he said that a cleaner comes and cleans the pool, and pointed a pool skimmer - I picked up the pole and guess what, the end where the skimmer is, the actual netting that scoops stuff out/off the top, was missing! Dirt and sand at the bottom of the pool, but no robot or cleaner, either, so god only knows when the last time it got "cleaned" - probably just gets chemically balanced with some chlorine.

The roof repair work didn't phase me, I was away before the works started and back when it had finished, but the scaffolding stuff is everywhere, pallets of unused framining and an obvious lack of concern for keeping things tidy (rubbish, overgrown grass, barrier tape in the mud), or collated (more scaffolding gear took over all the guest parking for the last few days).

The outdoor pool is only open from 9-6 Mon - Fri, because.....? That is when reception is staffed, but they don't provide any lifeguard functions or such. Weird.

Wifi is very slow, they give you 1 Mb speeds for free (what the....), and you have to pay for a higher speed. It is also an open network / not password protected.

These little things, in isolation, I normally don't get phased about, but when you compound all of it, it becomes a problem. Give it a miss

Be prepared to pay $10 per day parking on site, a bit of a shock when most accommodation provides free parking. Good wifi should be included in the cost. Unfortunately it is not. Apart from that, a good place to stay.

The staff were okay. We used the bar in the evenings, and although the sign said the kitchen closes at 9 pm, we were told at 8:40 pm that the kitchen was closed.
The gym wasn't cleaned for the two days we were there with no towels in the basket.

Text: We have always loved our stays at the Kurrajong Hotel in Canberra, making it one of our most favorite places. However, our recent experience was quite disappointing due to the noticeable decline in cleanliness.

From the moment we arrived, it was clear that the standard of cleanliness had dropped significantly. The floors were dirty, with visible dust and debris. The tables near the fireplace in the foyer were neglected and remained uncleaned for the entire duration of our stay.

Thee was an overall unkempt appearance.

It's disappointing to see such a lovely hotel fall short in maintaining its standards. We hope that the management addresses these issues to restore the Kurrajong Hotel to its former glory.

The Art Deco allure blends effortlessly with contemporary comforts, all complemented by impeccable service. It's a place to work, unwind in bespoke furniture, pamper yourself, and immerse in the essence of the nation's capital.
Waking up to birdsong and picturesque views of the manicured garden or staying in a heritage room dating back to when Parliament House was just a paddock adds a unique charm.

Only one front desk staff and quite busy when they have function events and group guests.
Pool and gym located on the other side under the residential building. A bit inconvenient.
Spacious room with all the essentials. Average amenities.
Nothing special with the breakfast. Only the very basic stuff. Definitely doesn't worth paying extra to get the breakfast included.
Convenient location near a tram station and close to the city centre.
Plenty of parking on site but can get quite full with all the function guests. More parking behind the building.

I checked in later in the evening and the reception staff were lovely. I was booked into the standard room located on level 2.

A very clean room and perfect size for a solo business trip.
As you will see in the photos attached there was a king size bed, a small desk, wall mounted tv, mini fridge, kettle facilities, small wardrobe, iron/ironing board and standard bathroom amenities.

Nice surprises in the room included the light switches by the bed there was a usb port which was very convenient for charging devices and the biscuits with the tea.

The Rex utilises a Gym and Swimming pool which is located next door, a short 20m walk away. This facility is strictly used by the Rex hotel guests which was great.

Text: Stayed in a 2-bedroom with my family for 1 night. Found some dirty underwear and a pair of socks behind the door of one of the rooms, and the toilet was filthy. There was no one at reception and no one was picking up the phone so I can raise the concern right on the spot, so had to pick up the dirty underwear and chuck them in the bin myself. Moreover, we were a family of four, but there was just 1 set of toiletries available.

The only saving grace was that the apartment was spacious and Marie, the lady who checked us in, was friendly. Other than that, the cleanliness of this apartment was horrible, and customer service was even worse.

I emailed the property to raise my complaint a few days after we checked out. Had to send 10 followup emails over the course of 3 weeks. Absolute nightmare.

After 5 weeks since I sent my first email, finally got on the phone with a person named Eva who said she’ll process the refund that day, but she didn’t, and I had to call again to follow up.

All that trouble for a measly 15% refund. Absolutely appalling.

Text: They do not have wheelchair accessible rooms told us they did!!!!

Was extremely disappointed with my stay at Oxley court Apartments. I use a wheelchair and had rang five weeks before to check that it was wheelchair accessible per the paperwork. The lady was extremely vague and said yes it is. We have a wet area.. I explained that my chair was heavy as I use a power chair and she promised that there was no steps.

I was a tad nervous, but believed that she knew what she was talking about. My friend also called to doublecheck The next day

When we arrived at the apartments, there was a step. She apologized and said she forgot. Secondly, when we went into the apartment, the wheelchair would not fit into the shower, Access the sink and there was no grab rails. My friend had to go and get some wood and a cot mat that They use for babies (so unhygienic )to scarily get me into the Apartment and we had to try and get my Wheelchair up into it. It did go up after many tries

I ended up in tears as I was due to go out that night to see a show and was unable to have a shower, and my friend had to help me to the bathroom.

So we Tried to get another accommodation room however it was the long weekend and everything was booked out on the Friday night. Luckily, the art deco hotel  very kindly had a room for us the next night and check us in at 11 AM that morning. It was extremely traumatizing and did not need to happen. So please be aware that they DONOT HAVE WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE ROOMS

Rating: 2
Text: At first glance, Rydges Canberra seems like a dream come true: a gorgeous lobby, a serene central location, and spacious rooms. But, like a beautifully wrapped gift hiding a brick, the reality is a bit of a shocker.

Let's start with the bedding. Imagine our surprise when we found bloodstains on the sheets. If this was a crime scene, the only mystery would be why housekeeping ignored our cleaning request entirely. Maybe they were too busy trying to fix the ancient thermostats – because clearly, they weren’t working. Our friends had to summon a space heater from the reception at 3am just to avoid frostbite.

And speaking of unwanted surprises, the nightlight motion sensor had the bright idea of switching on every time we moved in bed. It’s like having a disco in your room, minus the fun. The spa? Mostly non-functional. The sauna? Sporting a gaping hole in the roof, stylishly plugged with paper towels. The gym? A delightful trip back to the 1980s, complete with equipment that looks like it survived the apocalypse.

Sure, the location is great. But unless you fancy living in a DIY repair project, Rydges Canberra might not be worth the Rydges name.

I wiped down all the handles and surfaces, which were disgusting (see picture of dirt from fridge handle - and that was cleaner than the cupboard!), and there were bloodstains on the mattress protector which you could see through sheets.
Bathroom wasn't cleaned properly- bodywash empty and left on shelf to be refilled.
Others in my group staying there had similar issues. I also had no phone in my room, so had to walk downstairs to kitchen to order roomservice. Despite being told that phone would be provided, none turned up. Food was expensive and not great - steak very overcooked (asked for medium).
Only positive was that the bed and pillows were comfy.
Wish I'd read the other reviews before booking. Do yourself a favour and book elsewhere.  Thankfully my hotel in Sydney made up for it.

We got there and was told our rooms were not ready. We waited for over an hour.
Rooms were disgusting, not cleaned, very outdated furniture and the toilet wasn’t flushing!
Reception doesn’t answer your calls from the room, always had to physically walk down to them. All staff (except for the manager) looked like they had no idea about anything. They were extremely short of staff and everything was a delay.
Buffet breakfast: where do I start… dirty cutlery and plates, no cups available for coffee/tea.
Spreads and juices were not re filled  we had to physically get it ourselves from under the cupboards. It was terrible.
Our whole family got itchy rashes either the body wash made our skin itchy or the beds?! I asked reception to change the sheets for us but never heard back from them.. I could go on forever.
Terrible service, terrible experience will never stay here again and do not recommend this place at all!!!

I love that there was a kitchenette that you can use. They have a tablet in the room which you can use to ring the reception, order things and find just about anything which we think was pretty cool. There's a lot of carpet though, so if you have dustmite allergy, you might want to ask for a room with less/no carpets.

For the price of the room, we were disappointed we were placed right near where renovations were being done, having to endure unpleasant noise from early morning. Would have expected to be placed further away from the construction area considering the abundance of rooms. The room was fitted as expected of a hotel of this calibre, but be warned as you'll need to bring your own dental amenities.

The room itself was more than adequate for a one night stay. The hotel itself is about 2 minutes from parliament and 10 from downtown Canberra by car. Would happily book there again.

Text: This is an excellent hotel situated in a quiet leafy area. Only minutes to local shops in Kingston and Manuka  and a stones throw from The back of Parliament House.
The Brassey was built in the 1920's and is a stately building offering old charm ambience.
It is being refurbished at present however that did not distract from our 4 night stay over Xmas.
Our room was an upgrade and for under $100 a night was great value and comfort.
Due to the Christmas break we were only able to have one continental breakfast which was beautifully presented and most appetising.
The bed was honestly the best we have ever slept in. The room was large and extremely comfortable.
Beautifully kept and very clean throughout.
The staff and in particular Anna who we had the most contact with, was delightful. She was happy to share local attractions and places to eat and even genuinely showed interest in a photo album of our recent European holiday. Her bright and happy disposition was really appreciated.
We hadn't  been to Canberra in many years and was here to celebrate a special milestone. We loved every moment in our Capital city and are already planning on returning to The Brassey and Canberra in the not too far distant future.

Text: This place has really comfortable beds. If you're looking for a good night's sleep, then this is the place to go to. The rooms are large and sunny, however there are some issues with maintenance. Our toilet didn't work properly. We had to take the lid of the cistern to get it to refill. There is no minibar in the room's fridge, which wasn't that clean to begin with. The gym is really well appointed; much better facilities than your usual hotel gym. If you want to have a workout during your stay, this place is ideal. They have two squat racks and bumper plates, as well as free weights and machines. The push bike hire station is a great addition too. We hired for 24 hours and rode all around the city. The staff were very friendly and approachable. Good location and good value for money.

Good thing we brought our own domestos, jif and dishwashing liquid to clean out everything first. We had to put a blanket over the couch because it was itchy and prompted so much sneezing. If you're allergic to dust then don't come here. Very poor lighting. Teles dont work. Staff didn't really take care of us in terms of supplying refuse bags daily- we had to buy these. Same receptionist for check in and out - very rude didn't even greet us or pretend to be friendly.

Text: Please read.

General review:
- Thin walls, can hear every word of the neighbours
- No microwave or many facilities in the room at all
- Checking in can take a lot of time. Not knowing which entrance to use, or where your room is, and signage is confusing. The staff around often help with this and can be lovely! But the overall design and setup isn’t great.

Onto the worst bit:
My partner and I stayed here for two nights last year. I had wisdom teeth surgery so I brought soup with me whilst he ate from the restaurant attached to the hotel. Worst food poisoning I’ve ever seen in my life. We ended up calling an ambulance and to this day, almost a year later, he is still seeing doctors regarding issues from it.

I would never, ever stay here again. I just sincerely hope no one else has such an awful experience as we did. 💛

Needed to stay here for 2 weeks. The first time checking in the link I was sent didn’t even work. Was forced to call a number the bar staff gave me to get a code to only my room. Absolutely no direction of where to go or where to park.

The next day our code on the door didn’t let us back in and were on the phone again and forced to change rooms. Skip ahead 4 days and yet again our code won’t let us in, and again we’re asked to change rooms. I’ve had sooo many emails and texts with room numbers and codes I don’t know which ones work and which ones don’t.

Text: I have contacted Samuel Thompson via email, but he did not respond.

I purchased an apartment in January of this year. Samuel Thompson concealed the true body corp fees from me. The actual body corp fees are 50% higher than what Samuel Thompson informed me. Additionally, he did not disclose that the apartment has been in a year-long dispute with the builder due to structural quality issues. At the time of settlement, I compensated the former landlord for the body corp fees up to February of this year. However, in April, I learned from the property management's debt collection efforts about the actual body corp fees, the former landlord's overdue body corp fees for one quarter, and the structural quality dispute.

While I do not deny that my conveyancing lawyer may have been negligent, I believe Samuel Thompson owes me an explanation

Text: I recently stayed at Ovolo Nishi in Canberra, and unfortunately, it was a highly disappointing experience. From the moment I arrived, it was clear that this hotel did not live up to its hype.

First and foremost, the check-in process was chaotic and slow. Despite arriving during the specified check-in time, I had to wait over an hour for my room to be ready. The staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in providing any kind of assistance or apology for the delay.

The room itself was underwhelming. While the design is meant to be modern and stylish, it came off as impractical and uncomfortable. The lighting was dim, making it difficult to read or work, and the furniture was more about aesthetics than functionality. The bed was uncomfortable, and the pillows were flat and lumpy. The cleanliness was also questionable, with dust and dirt evident in several areas.

Noise was a major issue during my stay. The walls are paper-thin, and I could hear everything from the neighboring rooms and the hallway, making it impossible to get a good night's sleep. Additionally, the hotel's location near a busy street meant constant traffic noise at all hours.

The amenities were another letdown. The fitness center was tiny and poorly equipped, and the advertised "complimentary breakfast" was a sparse and uninspired selection that left much to be desired. The Wi-Fi was slow and unreliable, which was a major inconvenience.

Overall, Ovolo Nishi failed to provide the comfort, service, and quality one would expect from a hotel of its supposed caliber. I left feeling frustrated and dissatisfied with my stay, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant and restful experience in Canberra.

Text: I loved the hotel, the amenities and the service. The wood panels are amazing and Monster is incredible. However, I had two bad experiences that don’t allow me to give a 5-star review. One of the reasons I booked with Ovolo Nishi was that it included breakfast, a free minibar, a complimentary drink, and a tote bag. On my arrival, I was informed that the offer had ended that day, and that I didn’t have the right to it. I complained, and they offered me some vouchers for breakfast and drinks, but the minibar wasn’t free anymore. That was a ridiculous situation, as I arrived already needing to complain. Then, when departing, I was informed the total price was different from the price when I booked with a 30% discount. I checked my email, and it was true- the discount wasn’t in my confirmation email. I am 100% sure that when I booked the price it was showing was much less than what I paid in the end, and there was no way to prove it! I should have taken a screenshot when I booked. Again, I felt cheated and unhappy, the opposite of the way I was expecting to leave.

Text: Ugh where do I start… I can’t explain how disappointing my experience here was. I don’t think I’ve had such a poor hotel experience in my life.

I’ll start off with the few pro’s:
clean room, nice bathroom, beautiful interior design throughout the hotel and the breakfast was okay

Now the rest…
I booked my room on July 11 and I didn’t look much into this hotel at all, I had googled hotels in Canberra and thought this hotel looks very interesting and cool. I proceeded with my booking and when finalising the payment, the website said my booking included a complimentary mini-bar (among other things). I even messaged my partner at the time of booking to let him know that I’d be getting the mini-bar complimentary.
When I arrived, the check in process was slow and the desk was kind of in an awkward spot to begin with. I got to my room which was unfortunately only on the 2nd floor and had a very boring view of the road below and some bushland. I unpacked and went to check out the mini bar, when I noticed that there was a price list on the table. I thought there might have been an error so made a note to call reception.
I then noticed there was no bath robe in my room, I thought it may have been forgotten so I attempted to call reception - but the phone was completely broken.

I decided I needed to go speak to the staff directly, when I came down, there were two receptionists at the desk and I told them my concerns. The woman the checked me in was extremely apathetic, and asked if the complimentary mini bar was listed on my booking reservation. I told her that was the thing, I had gone back and checked my email confirmation and there was nothing mentioned there but there definitely had been when I processed the booking on the website. She asked to see the email and then glanced at it for, no exaggeration, maximum 2 seconds, before saying “yeah so it’s not there then,” in a really condescending tone. The man next to her looked up my reservation and said that they no longer do complimentary mini bars, and that I must be confused. How could I be confused? I had no idea this hotel did complimentary mini bars before? I never read the reviews before booking, how would I have just imagined it?

When mentioning my bathrobe, I was told that “this room doesn’t come with robes.” What? What kind of 5 star hotel doesn’t supply bath robes? I had booked the Original Sun room, which was around the mid price range for room options, so it wasn’t like I had “cheaped out” - not that it should matter because again, 5 star hotel.

Despite these things, no apologies or solutions were offered, they just gave me the reception number and sent me on my way. I felt humiliated and like I had made a fool out of myself just based on how rude the staff had spoken to me. I’ve never ever had to ever complain about anything when staying at a hotel, this was the first time and I felt completely shut down.

Across the remainder of the evening, I noticed my room to be really warm, to the point where I was having to strip completely naked. I had turned the aircon down, but it still felt warm. I thought maybe I was feeling sick or flustered, as there was no indication something was wrong. By around midnight, I hadn’t slept at all because of how warm it was. The clock next to my bed said it was 22°, when it was meant to be around 18°. I then checked the aircon control panel and it was flashing a wrench symbol and wouldn’t let me adjust any settings. It was 1AM by this point and I couldn’t see any use in going to the reception to make a complaint because I knew I had to check out in 7 or so hours, it just wasn’t worth the effort. I barely slept.

The super fast wifi was completely unusable. The ceiling lights kept turning on randomly. The blinds were extremely noisy trying to close.

I’ll never stay here again. I’d honestly like a refund. Abysmal experience.

To clear my doubts, I asked a lady what exactly that means and she said they will refill the rice. However when I asked them to refill it for me they said I have to pay extra again . Moreover, we ordered king prawns from specials that costs us $36 and really small portion. I don’t recommend this restaurant. They are very rude. Elderly lady didn’t smile at all when I asked to refill the rice she rudely said pay extra. Meal costs us nearly $70 . It’s not worth it.

We finished our dinner around 8:20ish and we were talking. The other lady came and she didn’t ask whether we want something else or not but she rudely took the dishes and wiped a table. It literally felt like she was asking us to pay the bill and leave . Very rude.

Text: When I entered the establishment, I was greeted by a quiet elderly lady, a friendly young woman, and a nervous young Asian man wearing glasses. However, the experience was marred by the behavior of the young man, which significantly impacted my perception of the restaurant.

His attitude and behavior were biased and not customer-oriented. While placing my order at the counter, he informed me of a $25 fee per person for dining in or suggested taking the food to-go. This came across as off-putting, and I ultimately chose the take-away option for $40.

Upon receiving my order, I inquired further about the dine-in fee, hoping to clarify the matter. His response was dismissive, suggesting I look it up online, despite having already done so. When pressed for more information, he changed his explanation from a dine-in fee to a minimum order requirement.

My main issue stemmed from his unprofessionalism, which created an unwelcoming atmosphere from the moment I interacted with him until I left Portia's Place. Despite this, the restaurant itself is pleasant, and most of the staff seem to be courteous. It appears that this particular individual may have personal issues affecting his professionalism, which he should address in order to meet the expected standards of customer service.

Avoid, no atmosphere, Average service, no smiles, overpriced food and small portions.
Get this just on entrees 1 beef spring roll for $5, and two burnt curry puffs for $10. Two Chicken wings $10, chicken and Corn soup$10.

But the kicker was the restaurant had 10 annual golfers in and this was once their favourite restaurant in Kingston and now not.
$16 take corkage each bottle!
They all said we would never come back, then sat there and made the most of the $16 corkage and strung it out beautifully.
They asked the owner for an explanation and he said do your research most bottles around this area are $30 to $50, it's up to you if you don't buy from us.
Wow! I won't be back. I was ready to order the main meal but after that, I said I would get the bill.

The only other thing I would have liked is parking options, as if you were staying  multiple nights and wanted to sleep in, you couldn't due to having to go down to pay for parking in morning. Other than that, I would stay here again for sure. Many thanks.

The catering on site is good and room delivery is easy to access from online booking. Room is clean and spacious. Facility is convenient to use: washing machine, dish washer, etc.

Text: Rooms were clean and tidy. However we found there to be no bin liners, sanitarian bags, salt or paper and not much sugar for our coffees. Certain objects were in very odd places that you wouldnt usually place. For example the toaster was found on the bedside table and the kettle was found under the bathroom sink. But everything was clean and tidy. Wasn't the best view (a brick wall) but that I understand can't be helped as its the building across the room. But very affordable for one nights accommodation and was close by walking distance to the local supermarket.
Thankyou for the pleasant stay.

Text: Best place to stay hands down!  It felt like the priority was on the guest's experience, not on profit.  You could do everything online, order from the pantry for pre-made meals & snacks, room service with not charge & check out.  The food was amazing & the coffee hands down best in Canberra.

Generous rooms, and the bunk set up is fantastic for small children. Food downstairs, while a little expensive, is great quality.

Text: Do not recommend for young people, especially women.
The only positive I can think of is its good location.
The average age is around 40 to 50, with many looking suspect/homeless. This is something they have mentioned addressing in other review, but I have seen no progress.
There are two toilets per floor (roughly 2 toilets per 90 people), and they were filthy.
Bedrooms offer no privacy with flimsy bunks squeezed together.
Access to your room and building is via your phone however there are minimal charging ports in rooms (though plenty in the kitchen).

Text: The only good thing is the location, closer to the Canberra Centre.
No reasonable parking options, I had to stay for 2 nights and it was hard for me to find the parking.
Cutlery provided in the kitchen was oily, not properly washed/cleaned.
There were no wardrobes in the family room and no hooks in the bathroom so you can't hang anything while you're taking shower.
No option to control the heating/cooling as it's all controlled by the reception. The room was very cold when we checked in.
I would not recommend this property for family with children.

Place: Quality Hotel Dickson

Text: The Quality Hotel in Dickson ACT is an adequate place to stay whilst in Canberra if you are looking for a comfortable place with the convenience of nearby shops and restaurants. The furnishings are clean, pleasant and modern and expect to find the usual in-room facilities such as kettle, air conditioning, microwave and free wifi. I booked my room online, weeks in advance and thought I caught a pretty good deal for a one night stay, but my room overlooked a central courtyard with a bar on the ground floor, so a lot of noise reverberated upward and I wouldn’t had been able to retire to an early night had it not been for the earplugs I packed. There was another wing which appeared to be tucked away from the noise, however it was not clear when my request for an alternate room was denied whether this was because of my discounted accommodation or if the hotel was indeed fully booked. Otherwise, the reception staff were friendly. Another unexpected but disappointing surprise was how the tea with my room service continental breakfast was served in a disposable paper cup. Were they thinking I wanted my tea to go?

The Reception staff were efficient and very helpful, especially Anish and Sia.  Anish sorted out our extended checkout issues promptly and to our satisfaction and we thank him for that.
The staff across the hotel were very pleasant and helpful at all times.  The hotel rooms were very spacious, clean, and quiet.  There were tea & coffee facilities, a toaster, microwave and ironing board which made for a very comfortable stay. The hotel is well located with restaurants, and Coles and Woolworths within walking distance. With complimentary membership of the Tradies, meant food and drinks were well priced and we enjoyed many good quality meals at Bluey's cafe.  The spacious lounge facilities were very welcome especially when entertaining guests. A luggage rack for suitcases would have been helpful, as we had to place our suitcases on the floor.
In all we enjoyed our stay at Quality Hotel Dickson and would not hesitate to stay there again.

There is a desk located in the room which was handy to use while doing some work-related online tasks.
WIFI was great.
The price of the room included breakfast….which came in a pre-made pack containing cereal, milk, energy bar, bowl, spoon, sweet lemon slice & there was a choice of two different cereals.
The reception has staff 24/7.
Lovely coffee & tea selection, with kettle to enjoy a cuppa in the room.
The staff kindly allowed me to use their boardroom for an impromptu morning work Zoom meeting (after check-out).
The boardroom was quiet, private, WIFI was great, many tables & chairs to use, if needed. I offered to pay an additional charge however the staff did not charge me for using the boardroom for 1 hr 😊
The Tradies Hotel is next door to the accommodation & they serve cakes & coffee, brunch, lunch, snacks, dinner & alcoholic beverages.
Also……there is an electric car charge station directly outside the motel which was handy to use.

Text: This place is reasonably priced and good amounts. Fast service and polite. I had the combination chilli box. Was nice and just right for a cold night to warm up. The noodles were not very long in length. I think the cook might have cut them while cooking.  Probably a bit too much onion and there was not much separation in the ingredients- by which I mean it all melded together a bit and was a bit greasy. Others had the Singapore box and that was much better - so maybe I just got a average serve. I would recommend this if you are in a hurry.

Place: The Australian National University

Rating: 5
Text: Visited the university during a short stay in Canberra. Heard it was Australia's top university, so had to make a visit. Campus is located in the center of the city with access to the newly built tram that's within a walking distance. University is well maintained and quite modern building infrastructure. There are a number of shops located within the campus.

Author: Erika

Text: It's a beautiful campus and obviously a great research institution, however if you aren't an academic/in research or simply studying an undergraduate that isn't in a select few areas, then they have no concern for your learning experience. This is one of few unis that is incredibly stubborn and uncaring in regards to any real world experiences, issues or difficulties that you might go through in your life.

Even with the assistance of some departments such as Wellbeing, A&I and more, jumping through hoops and navigating the difficult landscape and culture ingrained within the faculties and teaching staff is almost impossible. It's clear that the university is tailored to rich or upper class people with minimal to no life difficulties or experiences, who complete a typical life cycle of graduate high school -> go to uni full time and have parents fund your bills with a maximum 10 hour per week job/graduate uni -> get a graduate job through nepotism OR continue on to your postgraduate studies/research.

They sacrifice job experience and employability for a focus solely on academia and a refusal to make any accommodations for anyone who might need to work to afford university and life in general (see their refusal to offer any classes past 5 or 6pm or remote classes/learning in general, with no alternative options for remote learning, extra credit to make up for having to be away or missing classes due to any personal/health/financial/safety/similar reasons, and responses to similar requests along the lines of "university and higher education is a privilege and should be prioritised and treated as such").

If you are an intelligent individual but not financially blessed or come from any sort of hardship or difficulty then I'd thoroughly recommend going to another university with comparable or better academic rankings but with a much more caring and flexible approach to their students, as opposed to seeing them as sources of funding as a research institution.

Text: My wife and I did the Wonders of wildlife experience during the recent school holidays. It was amazing. A whole 7 hour day of encounter after encounter.

We were teamed up with Megan for the whole day and we just followed her around feeding and playing with the animals. It was just like having a friend on the inside spoiling you. She was super bubbly, nice, and informative, but also pretty casual and able to have a laugh.

The zoo itself is fantastic. So big, and the amount of care and love given to the animals is next level. It was also fantastic to see the owner walking around and mingling with the guests. You can just tell he has an amazing passion for these animals.

There's also the aquarium component which is small compared to the zoo, but is really nicely set out and beautiful to experience. The aquarium keeper has done a great job! If I were to suggest an improvement, the only thing I could think of is maybe adding some axolotls in the mix 😉 *cough* Ben *cough*.

Was overall an incredible experience and when my 2 little boys are older, we will be returning with them.

Today we did the African Savannah Safari with the lovely Jolly and Cooper and had the best time! We learned so much about the wonderful rhinos, elands, lemurs, zebras, giraffes, Barbary sheep and cheetahs. Such an unforgettable experience. The guys were super knowledgeable, friendly and made the whole experience just awesome. It’s so nice to see and hear how much the staff at the zoo truly care for the animals and know their personalities. Highly recommend the experience!

Text: Huge location in regards to parking, different entry points and very spread out.

Clean facility, ample amenities, dinner and safari were a must do.

The guide we had was really knowledgeable, friendly and had little stories about each animal.

Smaller zoo than ones I’ve been to before, though on the whole a fantastic experience.

4/5 not cause of the facility or service, I was expecting a bigger location, for the price.

Text: If you are a fan of brutalist architecture (I am), then this is a building not to be missed. Around forty years since it opened and still looking pristine - the same cannot be said for the approaches to the building which are being poorly managed.

Unfortunately the court was not sitting but it did give us the opportunity to wander into the court rooms and ask lots of questions of the very helpful and cheerful custodians.

A visit is not just for civic minded school groups! An excellent cafe is fifty metres away at the National Portrait Gallery.

Beds were super comfortable, and rooms were very clean and large (we booked a king room). Loved the touch of walking into a warm room with soothing music being played. Breakfast buffet is continental only, but you are offered a full cooked breakfast straight from kitchen which was delicious.  Unfortunately we didn't get to try their very popular restaurant, as it was closed on Sunday nights.  Library Bar was lovely to have a drink in. Highly recommend a stay here!!

If your into watching someone on the toilet while you sit on the bed, this place is for you. The shower soap wasn't in the shower. You had to get out of the shower and go to the vanity to put the soap on the wash cloth. The bathroom windows had frosted plastic contact stuck to the glass that was falling off everywhere and that was your privacy. Missing towel rails. You had to put your towel on the toilet cistern. My wife had a bath. I had to wait 30mins for the water to heat up again before I could have a shower. We were told AFTER checking in. There are only 15 parking spots at the hotel. I had to park two blocks away on the street and pay extra for parking. The entire hotel just felt tired and unmaintained. The only good thing is the location. We could walk everywhere. Definitely do not recommend this hotel
