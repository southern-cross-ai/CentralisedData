Text: Our stay at QT Hotel in Canberra was outstanding! The true test of a hotel's quality is how they handle things when they go wrong, and QT Hotel passed with flying colors. We experienced a minor issue during our stay, but the staff's prompt and efficient response turned it into a positive experience.

The team was incredibly professional and courteous, ensuring that the problem was resolved quickly and to our satisfaction. Their dedication to guest satisfaction was evident, and it made us feel valued and well taken care of.

Apart from the excellent service, the hotel itself is fantastic. The rooms are stylish and comfortable, the amenities are top-notch, and the overall ambiance is both chic and welcoming.

QT Hotel's commitment to exceptional service, especially in handling unexpected situations, makes it a standout choice. We highly recommend it and look forward to our next stay!

Text: Having stayed in multiple QT hotels, I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the rooms compared to the other locations. Rooms are usually extremely lavish and quirky yet the QT Canberra felt more like an IBIS. The lobby sadly is the only real modern aspect to the hotel. There is also extensive and noisy construction going on outside which can be heard even with the balcony door closed.
The reception staff were wonderful which I very much appreciated.

Text: As a wedding photographer, it's not always that I find a phenomenal wedding reception venue like QT Canberra. When it comes to urban-chic celebrations smack dab in the middle of Canberra, this place is definitely an option for you! My clients chose this funky hotel to have a blast with their wedding guests, and it couldn't have been better.

From the romantic, bar-like ambience to their services, the staff went above and beyond to ensure everything was catered to. And because of the exceptional customer experience, everyone could enjoy and have fun from beginning to end. I also had a fantastic time capturing the energetic bunch in this trendy reception space. I can't recommend it enough!

Text: $365 a night no breakfast. Right next door to major build works. There is no where close to get brunch or the like as this hotel does not open for food until 12pm. The room is adequate but not stunning which is why I feel like this is a $160-$200 Max place as it is quite ordinary. Prices on the menu are not correct, there is an additional charge.

Text: Frequently visiting Canberra and have stayed at many places. This time being a last minute trip there wasn't many options. Did plenty of research and was sceptical due to the review ratings. Pleasantly surprises with how good it was. Easy parking and close to everything. Gym is not much to ride home about. Attrium was a nice area to relax and have a drink. Very unique. Rooms were clean and well presented. Only dealt with staff during check in. No complaints there. Considering the price it was exceptional value and will be our first point of call next time we visit.

Text: Overall, my experience at the motel was dampened by the poor bar service and food poisoning. While I have always enjoyed the beautiful atrium and the abundance of live plants, the recent incidents at the bar have left a negative impression.
I ordered a drink using the QR code and it never arrived. It was only when I questioned the delay that my order was checked and the drink was finally organized.
Things took a turn for the worse on Day 4. When I ordered a beer, I discovered a lemon seed with a small piece of lemon in the glass that hadn't been washed from a previous persons drink. When I brought this to the staff's attention, it was dismissively waved off as a common occurrence. No replacement drink was offered, and I had to request one myself.
Later that evening, when I ordered a couple of desserts through the QR code, they were delivered to a table that wasn't ours. The table was already occupied. Only after I questioned the situation at the bar did a staff member walk over, grab the desserts from the other groups table, and hand them to me. This was a clear lack of proper hygiene and handling of orders. A better approach would have been for the desserts to be given to the table they were initially delivered to, as they had ordered the same desserts anyway. Our desserts should have been freshly prepared and served to us separately. This oversight demonstrated a lack of attention to detail, training and proper customer service.
On day 5 my daughter ordered a pizza, I shared half, appart from breakfast at the hotel, it was all I consumed that day , so we both ended up very ill,  food poisoning as stated by the doctor, the only common denominator was the pizza.
Some bar and evening meal staff appeared uninterested and nonchalant about their service. It is evident that better management and training are needed to improve the overall experience for guests.
The breakfast crew were very good, however the food was cold, and some of the plates had smear marks on them, the service desk crew are very good and helpful, some of the bar staff and the dinner crew destroyed the experience.
As a result of these disappointing incidents, its back to a search for another hotel. I will miss the ambiance of the beautiful atrium.

Text: The accommodation was truly excellent.
It was clean, and all the staff were friendly, so our family had no discomfort during our stay.

However, on the morning of our checkout day, around 10 AM, a rude man yelled and cursed at us on the second floor of the parking lot.
He continued to make derogatory remarks about Asians and gestured for a fight in areas without CCTV.
It was very frightening. He seemed to be a long-term resident, so please be careful if you encounter him.

When we reported this to the hotel lobby, they assisted us.
We are very grateful and had a wonderful stay thanks to their help

Text: The room was dated but decently clean.  The shower pressure was good, but the temperature fluctuated.  The very squeaky door to the room was fixed after I mentioned it.  The light flickered in the bathroom in a creepy way, but I forgot to mention that until my last day.  The buffet breakfast for $25 was terrible.  Selection was poor, and quality was low.
The 2 major positives to me were a memory foam pillow and being so far from other parts of the city, which means that there isn't much light pollution, so you can get a great view of the sky.
I did feel safe here, and the young man at reception was very pleasant and helpful.

Text: I’ll start with the positives first. The staff were friendly and helpful. The water pressure is strong, the aircon works fine and the bedroom and bathroom was clean (but outdated). I tried the dinner room service and the food was tasty.

The hotel is outdated and in my opinion does not meet 4 star standards. I stayed here on a work trip and unfortunately was really disappointed. The internet drops in and out constantly and my door malfunctioned and was openable without a card (this was fixed later). Because it is outdated there is no security required to enter the hotel after hours, anyone can walk in and walk directly to your door (even after hours). I found this to be unsafe, paired with the multiple signs around the hotel about theft and break-ins left me feeling uneasy. The telephone for room service was broken in my room. The shower makes a loud screech when being used and the strangest thing was the tissue dispenser- it’s the type used in public restrooms and not toilet rolls - just something I’ve never seen in a hotel before. Although the bathroom was clean, it was so outdated it felt dirty e.g black grout.
I tried the buffet breakfast and for $25 it was okay..their coffee machine was broken when I was there and they had the usual breakfast items, I would recommend eating out for breakfast.
The hallway lights are automatic so at night the hallways look creepy, nothing wrong with that but it just added to the whole vibe of the hotel. The carpets were also stained and worn.
I was expecting certain things like slippers, toothbrush amenity or writing stationary in the room for a 4 star however they only provide the shower amenities. I won’t stay here again for the price which was $175 per night - you pay for what you get, but they shouldn’t be classified as 4 stars….

Text: My granddaughters and I had a fabulous week in the ACT using GCH as our base. We didn't use the bar or restaurant, but the fare looked quite acceptable. We also didn't use the pool as it was the middle of winter, though it looked beautiful.
The rooms are clean, very comfortable, big enough for the three of us (and sundry amusements the girls brought), and perfect for our week's holiday. The air conditioner was highly efficient in the cold of winter, the wifi was strong and easily accessed. The bathroom was fabulous; it was clean, well stocked, and big enough, but the shower ( ! ) was heavenly 🥰 I would book there on the strength of that alone (I'm probably also easily pleased).
The staff, especially the beautiful Philippino housekeeper, couldn't do enough to help. Thank you for that. Old ladies travelling with little kids are always very grateful for the extras 🥰
I was concerned about the distance from town, but it was actually perfect. Quiet, though on a main road and minutes from all we needed, we were perfectly placed to go absolutely everywhere.
The girls and I will be back. GCH is now our base for all our ACT stays.
Thank you from the three of us 🙋‍♀️👩‍🦳🙋💐

Text: I don’t know where to start from. Room was an absolute shocker for me and my husband. The pictures they have posted online don’t match when you see them live. There was a very unpleasant smell in the entrance, throughout the hall way to the rooms. Room was very small, was not cleaned properly. There were tissues in the bedroom bin and the toilet bin already. The cups, glasses and the spoons were dirty. When I told the guy in reception about the cup, he was not interested in swapping. He was like oh ok bring the cup downstairs and I will swap it for you, seriously? Why did I pay $154 for? Never going back there again. The receptionist was rude.

Text: I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Adina Serviced Apartments during a business trip, which lasted about a week. The location is notably convenient, nestled close to the shopping center of Canberra, making it an ideal spot for those looking to explore the city's retail offerings. The premises were consistently clean and quiet, providing a peaceful retreat after a day's work.

Although the building and its design carry a certain vintage charm, they do appear a bit old and outdated. Despite this, the spaciousness and overall loveliness of the apartments more than compensate for the dated aesthetics. The apartments offer a blend of comfort and practicality, making my stay enjoyable and fulfilling. This accommodation is a recommendable choice for travelers who appreciate space and serenity, coupled with the convenience of a prime location."

Nothing special with the breakfast. Only the very basic stuff. Definitely doesn't worth paying extra to get the breakfast included.
Convenient location near a tram station and close to the city centre.
Plenty of parking on site but can get quite full with all the function guests. More parking behind the building.

I checked in later in the evening and the reception staff were lovely. I was booked into the standard room located on level 2.

A very clean room and perfect size for a solo business trip.
As you will see in the photos attached there was a king size bed, a small desk, wall mounted tv, mini fridge, kettle facilities, small wardrobe, iron/ironing board and standard bathroom amenities.

Nice surprises in the room included the light switches by the bed there was a usb port which was very convenient for charging devices and the biscuits with the tea.

The Rex utilises a Gym and Swimming pool which is located next door, a short 20m walk away. This facility is strictly used by the Rex hotel guests which was great.

To clear my doubts, I asked a lady what exactly that means and she said they will refill the rice. However when I asked them to refill it for me they said I have to pay extra again . Moreover, we ordered king prawns from specials that costs us $36 and really small portion. I don’t recommend this restaurant. They are very rude. Elderly lady didn’t smile at all when I asked to refill the rice she rudely said pay extra. Meal costs us nearly $70 . It’s not worth it.

We finished our dinner around 8:20ish and we were talking. The other lady came and she didn’t ask whether we want something else or not but she rudely took the dishes and wiped a table. It literally felt like she was asking us to pay the bill and leave . Very rude.

Text: When I entered the establishment, I was greeted by a quiet elderly lady, a friendly young woman, and a nervous young Asian man wearing glasses. However, the experience was marred by the behavior of the young man, which significantly impacted my perception of the restaurant.

His attitude and behavior were biased and not customer-oriented. While placing my order at the counter, he informed me of a $25 fee per person for dining in or suggested taking the food to-go. This came across as off-putting, and I ultimately chose the take-away option for $40.

Upon receiving my order, I inquired further about the dine-in fee, hoping to clarify the matter. His response was dismissive, suggesting I look it up online, despite having already done so. When pressed for more information, he changed his explanation from a dine-in fee to a minimum order requirement.

My main issue stemmed from his unprofessionalism, which created an unwelcoming atmosphere from the moment I interacted with him until I left Portia's Place. Despite this, the restaurant itself is pleasant, and most of the staff seem to be courteous. It appears that this particular individual may have personal issues affecting his professionalism, which he should address in order to meet the expected standards of customer service.

Avoid, no atmosphere, Average service, no smiles, overpriced food and small portions.
Get this just on entrees 1 beef spring roll for $5, and two burnt curry puffs for $10. Two Chicken wings $10, chicken and Corn soup$10.

But the kicker was the restaurant had 10 annual golfers in and this was once their favourite restaurant in Kingston and now not.
$16 take corkage each bottle!
They all said we would never come back, then sat there and made the most of the $16 corkage and strung it out beautifully.
They asked the owner for an explanation and he said do your research most bottles around this area are $30 to $50, it's up to you if you don't buy from us.
Wow! I won't be back. I was ready to order the main meal but after that, I said I would get the bill.

Probably a bit too much onion and there was not much separation in the ingredients- by which I mean it all melded together a bit and was a bit greasy.

Text: Reading the reviews, I think some people may have unrealistic expectations of retail staff. Honestly though, service was good, and the food was high quality. I'm use to the chicken being died af, but it was fresh here.

The only thing I can say wasn't so good is the condition the eating area is in. It's clean. However it is 100% the original fit out from 15 years ago. The owner should at least apply some paint to the walls, and should seriously consider looking at the situation with the ceiling tiles.

Other than that, I don't really have any faults with this Subway on my visit.

Text: Ordered veggie delite, Lima (staff member) started preparing chicken for another customers sandwich while mine was toasting so I asked her to change her gloves and she refused saying it doesn’t matter because everything is mixed and touching. I said I would still like her to change her gloves, I had to ask 4 times before she changed them with complaint and kept telling me how everything is mixed so I shouldn’t care and she shouldn’t need to change her gloves. Lima was rude and uncaring staff and talked down to me because I had asked her to simply change her gloves. No other worked at any other subway I’ve ever been to as had an issue with being asked to change gloves. Disgusting behaviour from Lima.

Although others have criticised the decor that goes back to when Jared Fogle was a reputable company ambassador (brick walls, jade green tables, squeaky wooden chairs, enormous pictures of ingredients), it's a nostalgic trip and I hope they avoid following Maccas' uninspired corporate interior design across the road.

Probably BP with the lowest fuel price in Canberra. Good place to fill your tank to full.

And he passed me the EFTPOS terminal with the amount of 165.xx! Luckily I checked it before I actually paid and told him that the number was wrong. He was unwilling to change it and said that the number was correct just the reading on EFTPOS Terminal was wrong. OMG, what an excuse!
After I made the paymemt and back to my car, this guy followed me out and said my credit card was declined! As I used Google pay, it was clearly stated that it went through! He asked me to show him the receipt and I found the receipt and it also showed that the payment was completed!
Then this guy asked me to give him my ID! I refused and then he asked me to give him my contact.
Worst experience with BP as I usually trust this brand!

In a shop where you can effectively “build your own sandwhich” the staff were angry when I asked for  ham instead of chicken in a melt…. Because there is no ham melt on the menu. 🤷‍♀️
I was all too difficult to reach for a different meat. It was even more difficult to put the whole sub in the microwave for 30 sec (coz, um, melt means heat up so that the cheese melts… and then it was too difficult to put “a little bit of onion” on there, and you huffed again when I asked you to remove some of the giant handful you put on there.
I asked for a bottle of soft drink to add to the order, and could only see 600ml bottles in the fridge, but somehow, from somewhere, you produced a small 390ml bottle.
I paid nearly $15 for a 6 inch sub, a small bottle of drink and a cookie… and the experience of your grumpy service.

If you want to run a shop that offers people flexibility in ordering - you need to learn how to have FLEXIBILITY and some customer service.

Text: The star of the show at O'Malley's is undoubtedly their Guinness stout on tap. Poured to perfection, it was rich, creamy, and smooth, exactly how a good Guinness should be. The pint had the perfect balance of roasted malt flavors and a slightly bitter finish, making it an absolute pleasure to drink. For any stout enthusiast, this is as good as it gets outside of Dublin.
Complementing the excellent beer is their delectable Guinness pie. This hearty dish was a perfect blend of tender beef, savory gravy, and a hint of Guinness, all encased in a golden, flaky crust. Each bite was a comforting taste of Ireland, with the rich flavors melding together beautifully. The portion size was generous, ensuring a satisfying meal that pairs perfectly with a pint of Guinness.
In summary, O'Malley's Irish Pub is a fantastic spot for anyone looking to enjoy an authentic Irish experience. The exceptional Guinness stout on tap and the mouthwatering Guinness pie are must-tries.

One of the waitresses was very unprofessional and rude. She shows her attitude when I ordered in Chinese, saying that she can't speak Chinese, I said to her "Well then can you get someone who speaks Chinese(in English)?" She seems like wanted to punch my face. I wonder why she is so angry. Is that because she has not ability speak Chinese but she works in a Chinese restaurant, and she feels shame? Or has She just been jealous because I can speak one more language than her? Anyway, a male waiter came this time and take over ordering, with a pleasant attitude even though he speaks Cantonese.

I will not come back to this restaurant again or recommend anyone visit this restaurant either. 0 star for the service.

26/08/23 update:
The main point is the attitude of that waitress! What happens if she meets someone who does not speak English at all? Will she look down on the client?  I doubt it because I do not see any quality of hospitality from this waitress which should considered important in the hospitality industry.

Plus, I have attached the photo of the dish we had that day in which garlic moss was undercooked.

Again, not recommend anyone visit this restaurant.

The sandwich making was lacklustre. It was sloppy with meatballs falling out the end, and then only the top was cut and it was off centre. I had to rip the bottom to cut it through which meant that eating it was very sloppy and awkward between trying to eat excess bread on one side with a meatball and sauce falling out.
I got what I asked for, but no care was taken in service or sandwich making.
Khush at the till was friendly enough but didn't ask for my subway card or whether I wanted to pay cash before hitting the EFTPOS machine so had I had my card close by and not in its RFID blocking sleeve, it would've taken payment without me scanning my subway card.

Poorly stocked and really roughly cut salads.
Staff are very slow and careless getting other salads and salt and pepper across other sandwiches in the line.
When wrapping fillings were always falling out.
Cashier didn't know how to process items and overcharged me for a 6 inch sub and a small drink charging $15.

This store needs a serious overhaul and actually hire  experienced staff on busy nights like a Friday where all the above happened in one visit.

Until then, go literally anywhere else.

The only downside was that the apartment was quite dark, even with the heavy curtains opened, which meant having to keep the lights on most of the time. This wasn’t a major issue as we weren't in the apartment much during the day.
The hotel's location is excellent—close to food, shopping, and the tram. It's ideal for those who like to get around on foot, as there was no need to use the car at all.

We booked the 5:45 pm session. Other domes got their candles lighted, for whatever reasons, the waitress just left us inside the dome without turning on the light/lighting the candle, thanks for offering us the quiet time in the darkness. If you want us to do it ourselves, please at least let us know where the switch is or leave us a lighter :)

I mentioned to the waitress that I dropped the cutlery, but no one showed up with a new butter knife until I had to go find someone :)

Also low quality furnitures - the dining table was not stable, it was an absolutely delightful experience having dinner on a wobbly table :)

It was quite cold after sunset. The dome’s got an a/c, which was great. However, the a/c remote control did not have a working display - the waitress eventually told us that we had to press and hold the display screen (yes, the screen lol) to check the temperature settings etc lol

Oh I almost forgot to mention the insects on the ceiling :)

While we were having our dinner, no one ever asked if everything was okay :) which obviously wasn’t lol

Very unpleasant experience and I think the food was quite average as well (we had the 3-course dinner which was $120 per person). Don’t waste your time and money :)

As far as the service is concerned, there is only one lady servicing and waiting all the tables. She definitely does her best but she is overworked. Her name starts with 'D'. The owner just sat around and didn't bother to help. When we walked in, we were made to sit at a table that was not cleared. It was messy and the owner did nothing. We had to wait for a good 15 mins before the one lone server was able to get to our table. Not a good start to our experience but thankfully it picked up from there.

In terms of food, we ordered the fried Camembert which was quite a sizable portion and could well be shared between two people. The fried skin was absolutely delicious!

For mains we ordered the Prime Rib and the eye - fillet with peppercorn sauce. The prime rib being a premium cut of meat was quite underwhelming. We ordered it medium rare but it wasn't cooked evenly at all. Some parts were well overdone but the eye fillet with the peppercorn sauce was way way better. The peppercorn sauce was to die for. Dessert was also a hit and miss. The creme brulee we ordered was warm on the inside and didn't have the glass shattering sound from the burnt sugar.  The sticky date pudding however was outstanding and definitely compensated for the hot creme brulee. It's definitely one of the best sticky date puddings I've tried.

Overall, our experience wasn't too bad but in my opinion if you're paying the steep prices, the quality of the food and service needs to be impeccable.

Too many tables for the space allowed in the restaurant, which subtracted from the atmosphere somewhat. However, it was clear that this was a popular restaurant. For a Monday night, most tables were occupied!

We had a larger group of 9 and the venue was quite noisy - hard to hear others not right next to me. There were lots of little nooks around the place and some lovely outdoor seating - I think this would be lovely with 2 or 3 people.
Service was good - didn't have to wait too long to take orders or for food to come out.
Parking was a bit tricky at lunch time on a week day - leave yourself time.

Very happy that they split the bill.

All in all, a pleasant experience.

Text: I love coming here, it's a lovely sparkly gem of hawker. This unassuming cafe packs a punch when it comes to service and food. Staff are attentive and provide efficient service in a warm and approachable manner. Water was provided straight away. Drinks were served quite quickly after placing the order and my knife replaced with a steak knife before the food arrived. No matter how many times I go, the food presentation is impressive. Servings are generous and taste delicious. Hotcakes where light and fluffy, and cooked all the way through, a success for a hotcake so thick. The banana bread was satisfying, not overly sweet, not too dense, and still full of great banana flavour. I loved seeing morning steak on the menu - it makes me nostalgic. This item even blew away my great memories. If you've never had Steak n Eggs for breakfast this is the place to do it. Steak was cooked well, though a little under seasoned for my taste. The bacon was crispy, the eggs just runny and without an acidic after taste, an the holindaise was delicate and creamy. It's a great place to come again, and bring friends.

We decided on Jimmy’s Place for dinner after walking around Dickson for a bit as it was a restaurant with quite a few people in there compared to the others in the area. We thought Canberra was going to be expensive but the lobsters🦞were actually cheaper than Melbourne. We ordered a stir fry ginger spring onion lobster egg noodle & it was delicious!😋Lobster was fresh & noodles were well made/seasoned. We also ordered a variety of dishes to accompany the steamed rice. Each dish was of a generous portion with fresh ingredients used & very tasty. Total bill was also cheaper than Melb which was a bonus. Highly recommended restaurant for yummy Chinese cuisine in Canberra.👍🏻

Pack A ($43.89, good for four) came with Mongolian Beef (truly delicious!), boneless Chicken with Lemon Sauce (moist and flavourful), fried rice (my kids took it all), and three spring rolls that were great but probably would have been even better if we had them freshly fried (we took 15 minutes to get home). We also ordered a hot and sour soup that my wife enjoyed. The counter lady was very friendly and we didn't wait long for our food. Overall, a great experience, we would definitely return and dine in so that we can really enjoy all that food fresh from their kitchen.

The waitress told me that a certain type of chicken is out of stock and asked if i am happy to change to another type of chicken for the same dish without mentioning any additional cost. Not until checkout are we informed that we have to pay $7 extra for the change. They argued with us and insisted us to pay.
Nonetheless, the chicken itself and the so-called ginger and shallot sauce is tasteless. It was like eating boiled meat from the soup.
Terrible dining experience. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to try.

The staff were professional, friendly and attentive. As for the main event (the food), the three tiers were very good with savory options on the bottom plate, a “hot option” which was brought on a separate plate, scones and jam on the second tier and sweet delicacies on the top. The flavors were excellent with great barista coffee and teas.

Well worth the visit. My only criticisms are that some of the gluten free options weren’t as good and there could have been more savory items on the bottom tier. I know that the cake stand approach came in during COVID (understandable), but a return to the buffet would give more choice to customers. That would be a truly 5 star experience.

Text: We were so looking forward to this experience as part of our stay. It turned out to be the most disappointing part of our visit to Canberra.
We were seated and offered sparkling wine, lovely (it wouldn't hurt the staff to smile or make you feel welcomed).
It was then almost 30 minutes before anyone came back. Then the staff confirmed that one of our party were vegetarian, which was correct. Another 20 mins before anyone came back.
The tier of savoury & sweet food came out first. The mini trifles on the second tier might have been nice, but we wouldn't know as we weren't given any spoons small enough to get into the glasses in which they we served. We then began on the scones and had them finished and still hadn't been served any tea to drink. The hot food for the meat eaters was served (even though this was the first course on the menu). Again, another confirmation about the vegetarian food.
We then had to ask for tea. My guest asked for milk, the staff member appeared upset at the request. Another long wait for it to be brought to the table. The cheque was then brought to the table.
We then ate the sweet course and were finished when the vegetarian meal was served, two mini quiches (we had already confirmed the day before on the phone vegetarian - no meat or eggs). We were still drinking our pots of tea when a staff member came around upset that we hadn't paid yet.
This was supposed to be a nice afternoon, it was a shambles.
I honestly couldn't recommend the Afternoon Tea. I wouldn't want anyone else to be made to feel the way we were.
On a positive note, I can say that the Canberra Earl Grey might be one of the nicest blends of tea I had ever tasted - highly recommend.

Text: La Rustica Restaurant in Kingston offers an unparalleled culinary experience that is worth savoring. From the moment I entered, the warm and inviting ambiance set the stage for an exceptional dining journey. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, providing impeccable service throughout.

The menu at La Rustica is a testament to their dedication to authentic Italian cuisine. Each dish is crafted with care, showcasing the freshest ingredients and traditional flavors. From the delicate handmade pasta to the perfectly cooked meats, every bite was a burst of culinary bliss. The presentation of each dish was a feast for the eyes, elevating the overall dining experience.

However, it must be noted that dining at La Rustica does come at a higher price point. The quality of the ingredients and the culinary expertise reflected in the menu do justify the higher cost. Nevertheless, for those on a tighter budget, it may be a splurge reserved for special occasions or when looking to indulge in an extraordinary dining experience.

Despite the higher prices, the exceptional quality of the food, the attentive service, and the inviting atmosphere make La Rustica Restaurant a five-star destination. If you're willing to invest in an unforgettable dining experience and appreciate the finer aspects of Italian cuisine, La Rustica is the place to be.

Text: Since we were due for a lunch or dinner date at a restaurant starting with the letter ‘L’ our ‘ABC’ lunch/dinner group chose La Cantina. One of our party had dined here with work colleagues on several occasions and the pizza came highly recommended.

Several couples ordered the main dish of calamari to share as an entrée. The calamari was tender and crispy and fine as an entrée but I suspect many would find the portion size small for a main meal.

With a long run scheduled for the following day I ordered the Margarita Pizza and it was actually a good size for one and very delicious. My husband ordered barramundi served with clams and he said the fish was excellent but the overall meal size small. He appreciated a few slices of my pizza.😊 Several pasta dishes were ordered and again the serving sizes quite small. Most of us do not have big appetites so not really a problem but if you do enjoy a hearty meal order a few extras.

On the the whole the food was good but I would not say exceptional. The Italian decor is lovely - quite elegant.  However, I did not feel the ‘ambiance’ others have spoken of in some of the reviews. In fact I felt no warmth or welcome from the staff at all. It was a quiet day for the restaurant which may have accounted for this. It’s 3.5 star ⭐️ from me.

Food and beverages were amazing, staff were friendly and on point. Working in hospitality myself, I know the crazy 'markup' (wedding tax) that wedding venues add on, this was definitely not the case at the Boathouse.

The food was absolutely phenomenal.  There was no course that let us down and we're all still trying to work out which course was the favourite -- a good sign.  One of our guests has a small problem with eggs and they quickly pivoted to provide her with something that was just as good to replace what she couldn't eat.

No table was on top of any other table -- so that gives a great ambience as well.

It's a great way to do Christmas and we'd be happy to do it again!

From the early stages of inquiring about availability and prices  Laura and James were fully transparent, responsive and helpful. As we progressed to planning the event, Laura provided answers to our questions in a timely manner and was very accommodating of our last minute changes. The seamless operations included the Boat House team coordinating with other vendors, meaning we could be in the moment on the big day, and in the lead up.

On the day, the food was delicious and the service was impeccable. Many of our guests noted how professional the front of staff house were, and still talk about how amazing the food was. All dietary requirements were accommodated without compromising quality.

The Boat House is such a scenic Canberra location for wedding. The reception outdoors under the trees, overlooking the lake, followed by a classic late summer sunset was truly iconic. The indoor dining space provided the perfect environment for all our guests to talk, before providing the perfect space for a dance floor.
The interior design of the lobby, and dining space provided a beautiful ambience. It didn't come to it, but knowing the lobby was the backup plan for wet weather filled us with confidence.  The decorations organised by the Boat House working with Moxom + Whitney on table settings were beautiful and meant we didn't need to organise any additional decor.

We would not change a thing. Thank you to the Boat House for the perfect day.

Was so excited to try this restaurant for the first time I was sit there and read the all menu for a while and it is a lot of choices which is good but I would say this is the WORST dish I ever had in any of Thai restaurant even inside or outside Thailand. idk how can yall call this as a Pad Kee Mao I believe i did not eat this more then 6 bites and every time i put it in my mouth i feel like I am eating dirt and it is $21 for this dish but thank you for not charging me for this and last thing I wanna say is I HAVE NEVER REFUSE TO EAT THE FOOD FROM ANY RESTAURANT AND THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BECAUSE I CANT EVEN FORCE MYSELF TO EAT IT
(It might be good for someone who have never tried real Thai food or for who have never go to Thailand and have no idea what is REAL Thai food taste like) and to the owner of this restaurant I am so sorry to write this bad review it is just because of the food is bad so I have to.

Text: Food presentation was overall pretty good, but as what Chef Alvin Leung says, "Taste is King."

The Laab Moo Tod tasted a bit burnt. The Pad See Ew was pretty average but less sweet and overall flavourful than your average Pad See Ew and the meat was slightly less chewy than a tire. I would probably only pay $11 at absolute most for this $20.90 dish.

It might be okay as your local thai place, but if you want something exciting, go elsewhere.

We had a very charming and attentive gentleman serve out table and he was very helpful in ensuring the one member of our group who is vegetarian and allergic to crustaceans was provided with excellent alternative dishes when required.
Sophisticated modern Malaysian is how I would describe the menu. There is a fixed 3 course menu for $90.00 and a degustation menu. BYO is acceptable with a $25.00 per bottle corkage fee. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and not too noisy - rare these days! Tablecloths! Also rare. I’d say an ideal choice for special occasions. 5 ⭐️

Text: I recently dined at Lanterne, and my experience was far from satisfactory. The atmosphere lacked any sense of warmth or comfort. Adding to the disappointment was the poor customer service; the staff seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the evening.

The degustation menu was particularly underwhelming. The portions were exceedingly small, leaving much to be desired in terms of value for money. The chicken dish was especially not pleasant, with a texture and flavor that were completely unappetizing. The lavender dessert was equally unpleasant, offering a peculiar taste that did not sit well. We both didn’t touch our dessert at all and none of the waitresses asked why.

To make matters worse, our desserts were served in coffee cups, which differed from the presentation given to other patrons. This inconsistency only added to the feeling of neglect and subpar service.

Overall, my visit to was a thoroughly disappointing experience that I would not recommend to others.

*Quit update:The way the reviews get dealt with is proportional to the level of customer service provided. Instead of taking reviews as an opportunity to improve, it seems that everyone comes from the hospitality environment and they want to judge them! Such a bad approach and customer management.

The food was sensational and lived up to the reputation of trip advisors number 1 fine dining restaurant in Australia for 2020. My boyfriend doesn’t often comment too much on food but for him to say the food was really good as well is huge! The staff were very friendly, professional and attentive. Special mention to Maddy who was exceptional and took very good care of us. The only point I could make was to remove the butchers paper from the tables as it detracted from the fine dining experience. Other than that it was a wonderful experience and I can highly recommend especially for a date night. The mint garden outside is a beautiful setting for a cheeky drink or two. Definitely add sage to your to visit list, you won’t be disappointed.

Our party got the 5 course degustation but they bring out dishes in-between the menu items which was a very welcome surprise. Every dish is beautifully prepared and all the flavours are masterfully put together.

When we went it took about 3 hours to finish the dining experience. Because of all the dishes in-between you hardly noticed but just something to be aware of.

The food was decent but did not quite live up to expectations. The oysters were fresh and tasty, the bread was delicious but the starter and the main were a bit underwhelming. The kingfish sashimi was ok but a bit overdressed. The blue eye cod with seared scallops was tasty but the sauce was a bit thin and watery. I would rather not say anything about the house-made ice cream.
The service was impeccable and overall it was a semi-enjoyable experience.

They allowed me (a table of 1) to have the degustation which is generally reserved for 2 or more.  Some other restaurants don't have flexibility around this so I appreciated their flexibility.

Their degustation is also interesting whereby you can select any 5 or 6 from the menu to try. They just adjust portions accordingly.

I went for the 6 course and had the oysters, kingfish, prawn, duck, eye fillet and the chocolate parfait and they were all excellent! The duck may have been a little too undercooked for my comfort but was still great.

Highly recommended if you are visiting Canberra and want a nice night out.

Text: I expected a little bit more from this restaurant. I was seated at a table near the wall and the place felt a little crammed as there was a person directly behind me, some may call this cosy but the layout could do with some work.

We ordered a cocktail that did not ever arrive and decided not to tell the waiters as we did not want it anymore. The focaccia bread was delightfully soft and crisp, well seasoned. The suckling lamb was tender but tasted purely like red wine and tomato sauce. No other distinct flavours could be distinguished from the dish. The salad we ordered also had many lettuce core pieces and it seemed as if no care was put into the dish as it was mainly comprised of lettuce with a stingy amount of nectarine. At $36 average you can get waaay better pasta in Canberra.

Overall the food was ok but did not leave me satisfied, service was adequate as we had a nice lady waitress but I would not come here again.

We visited from Melbourne at the recommendation of ex Canberra residents and we were expecting a good experience but honestly didn’t expect it to be this good!

He also seemed to visit every table in a very busy restaurant to explain the specials and just have a welcome or goodbye chat. I have never seen this level of attention from the “main man” before. And the food was magnificent and reasonably priced. I had snails done in a different way, tomato based. The juices soaked up by their in house sourdough. Then the duck - fabulous.

The coffee is surprisingly good for a chain, though it's nothing extraordinary. The latte art is a nice touch, making it better than some other places.

We also tried a mango smoothie that oddly tasted like banana and ice—not great at all.

We didn't sample much of the food, but we did have scones. They came with jam in small plastic packets and whipped cream instead of clotted cream, which tasted just as unappealing as it sounds.

The place itself is in serious need of a makeover and a thorough cleaning. The outside tables were dirty from previous guests and bird droppings, which was quite off-putting. The clientele seemed to be mostly pensioners, though it's unclear why.

On the plus side, they did have a highchair, which was a rarity in the area and earned them some points.

And to my surprise there was more vegetables than chicken in my chicken tikka masala which was pretty costly. The gravy was nice but dude where’s the chicken? When we order something a full plate we atleast expect a decent amount, the amount of chicken in it was not even good enough to fill one person let alone two. The food didnt meet indian standards but it was still good. The manager was really nice to us when we gave him feedback about the chicken, however the manager is only nice to you if your order exceeds a good amount 😂 once I went there to just get one dish and he wasnt all that friendly all of a sudden.

The coffee at Yarralumla Gallery and Oaks Brasserie is excellent, and the staff are always friendly, which makes it a nice spot to enjoy a cup of coffee with friends. However, I can't overlook the fact that the area around the coffee shop is often messy and dirty. From the streets outside to the seating area inside, and the toilet cleanliness seems to be an ongoing issue. It's a shame because it affects the overall experience negatively. The owners might want to consider tidying up the surroundings to enhance the appeal of their wonderful coffee. Until then, I'll have to think twice about returning.

The Hellenic Club opened in early 1979, and after many years in 2009, the Hellenic Club expanded to the amazing place it is today...

The club is located on the corner of Launceston  St & Callam St with the parking access off Bowes St, Callam St is close to vehicle access as part of Woden upgrade...

I've been to a couple of beautiful functions here at the Hellenic Club, one in the Olympus Room for the National Day of the Kingdom of Morocco crowning day for the King of Morocco and the other a beautiful wedding for great friends of ours!

The overall layout of the Hellenic Club is truly spectacular from the entrance right through to the small garden lounge area!

The food I've eaten here over time has always been the best of quality, all though I haven't yet tried out the Ginseng Chinese restaurant, which is very nice meals to what I've read...

The staff have always been respectful and helpful, and I must say the Hellenic has some great statutes throughout the club!

The club has a large parking area of Bowes St, which at times can be hard to get parking...

The toilet facilities have always been clean and tidy...
My only suggestion is that some of the seats upstairs in the function rooms need to be cleaned...

It's truly a beautiful club.

The market gets crowded around noon. It becomes difficult to move around. The market is not so clean and there are some shops that you can notice the flies. So be careful what you're taking and eating.

There is live music, which is nice, so you can take a break from shopping.

I didn't find this place to be cheaper then other markets but you definitely can find everything you're looking for. From basic to unique ingredients.

The fish shop there is fabulous!

Text: Mixed reviews so hoped for the best but wish I hadn’t. Chefs special hot and Spicey chicken was just a container of bones. Their special fried rice has peas and carrots in it. Won’t bother again- extremely disappointed.

Text: Tasty food, but had to wait two hours to get it. Ordered at 6.30pm, estimated delivery time was 7.45pm. Phoned at 8.05pm to see where my order was and was told it had been delivered... huh? After explaining it hadn’t, was then told it was being cooked now and would be another 20 minutes. Offered a 10% discount on a future order after complaining, turned that down as doubt I’ll be ordering from here again. Final delivery time was 8.25pm.

Text: From start to finish Diamond Chinese restaurant in belconnen had me smiling all the way!!! :-) :-) :-)

The ladie on the phone was pleasant when taking my order. :-)

All dishes were more then satisfactory.

The Mongolian beef was very flavoursome with lots of sauce. Big :-)

The Honey chicken was crispy and made from real chicken breast and also had plenty honey sauce seperate which I also enjoyed. Big :-)

The curry chicken was also full in the container had a plenty of flavour and once again plenty of sauce. Big :-)

The hot and sour soup was to die for. True complements to the chef. Wow!! :-0

Not only were the meals all we expected they went above and beyond throwing in a bag of prawn crackers and a 1.25lt soft drink. ;-)

Pricing was reasonable and food delivered on time!!! :-)

Hands down excellent service !!! Well done guys!!!

I would rate more then five stars if I could

Text: Edit: that lightning timed response has made my night🤣. I'm almost impressed. Sorry my life doesn't revolve around keeping up with a night club choosing to be lazy with their music choices! x💓 Maybe focus on prioritising the music choices over responding to reviews😘

Also when downstairs the security absolutely manhandled the heck out of a guy that didn't need to be manhandled. It was super messed up you guys x

Is the DJ at mooseheads aware that there are more musicians in the world than Taylor Swift that actually contain multitudes of talent and substance that she herself lacks..... two songs in row is almost forgivable, but when the whole night is just back to back that (over 4 times in a row)...🤢🤮

Text: Mooseheads is a vibrant  dancing club that offers an unforgettable experience for young people . Located in the heart of the Canberra city, As soon as I step inside, I'm  immediately captivated by the lively atmosphere and energetic vibes.The dance floor allows big room for guests to move freely and showcases an incredible sound system that bring you to another level.
The staff at Mooseheads are friendly, attentive, they clean floor roughly 5-10 mins. And they dedicated to ensuring that every guest has a fantastic time. It  is an excellent choice for a memorable clubbing experience.

🧱I liked having breakfast outside, the space is protected by glass with wood frames, which makes it look comfy and chic.
✅I recommend it, for its taste, its service and the style👌🏻.

Text: What a little quaint cafe in Canberra that also resembled the 60s. The service and food were extremely quick. Coffee was good! I ordered the French toast and it was very tasty. Liked the use of fresh fruit. Would’ve preferred a slightly thicker brioche. Also I asked for hash brown as a side. Make sure your specify on a separate dish as they placed it onto my coulis.
Steak Sando was delicious however, the fries were too salty and the steak was not salted enough.

Text: I recently had the pleasure of visiting Gus Cafe, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee hits you as soon as you walk in, instantly setting the cozy and inviting atmosphere. The baristas were not only skilled in crafting the perfect cup of coffee, but they also exuded warmth and friendliness that made me feel right at home.

The quality of the coffee was exceptional, with a rich and robust flavor that truly impressed my taste buds. From the moment I placed my order to the moment I took that first sip, it was evident that the staff takes pride in delivering top-notch beverages. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident in the attention to detail and care put into every cup.

The combination of excellent coffee and genuinely friendly service is what sets Gus Cafe apart. It's rare to find a place that not only serves a great cup of joe but also creates an environment where patrons feel valued and welcome. If you're a coffee enthusiast looking for both a delightful caffeine fix and a warm atmosphere, Gus Cafe is the place to be. I can't wait to visit again and savor more of their wonderful offerings.

Text: Plenty of seats, waiting time is fairly okay. Great coffee, we also tried the matcha latte (they only have with soy milk).
The customer services, on the other hand, is the worst. The waiters are pretty okay and helpful, but there was a girl standing at the counter who did the bill for us, she is very unfriendly, which made us feel very uncomfortable. Food was standard, not too special but portion is good.

Overall, this is still a good place for brunch and gathering, but we won’t come back.

Text: Hands down the best laksa you will find in Canberra. It's the only thing I ever order here aside from a few side dishes, so I can't really comment on the other menu items other than having seen them looking alright. Well-portioned, fragrant and fairly priced laksa is what I'd come here for.

Text: A nice,  casual dining eatery on Woolley Street. The service was prompt, and the decor was neutral. I had the combination laksa, which was nice. I wouldn't say that it's the best laksa I've had in Canberra, but it was pretty good.

Text: We first visited Dickson Asian Noodle House about 14 years ago and remembered the Laksa to be very fragrant and tasty. This certainly doesn’t appear to have changed. Fast forward to 2024, the laksa still tastes great. The Hainan Chicken Rice was good but it certainly didn’t taste like Hainan Chicken.

Came for the laksa. Whilst I enjoyed it, it was a more western version than I prefer, too sweet and creamy, with the protein elements relatively tasteless
Service was excellent and food arrived quickly. I had the jumbo with many protein elements but again, they lacked the deep, spiced flavours I prefer.

Text: My recent dining experience at Asian Noodle House in Dickson left me with mixed feelings about the overall visit. While the food was passable, the service and attention to detail fell short of expectations, resulting in a rather disappointing outing.

Starting with the positives, the menu offered a decent selection of Asian noodle dishes. Although the flavors were just okay and didn't quite stand out, they provided a satisfying meal for our group. However, it was the service that left a significant dent in the overall experience.

One particular instance was the coconut juice we ordered. To our dismay, it had an off-putting chemical taste that was impossible to ignore. We brought this to the attention of the staff, hoping for a swift resolution. Regrettably, it took the intervention of the owner or manager after we expressed our dissatisfaction for any action to be taken. While the explanation regarding a supplier change was provided, it's crucial to note that the taste of a beverage shouldn't be compromised by such changes. Customer experience should be the priority, regardless of supplier modifications.

Furthermore, the beef crispy noodle dish had an unexpected sour note that left us questioning its intended flavor profile. This inconsistency raised doubts about the quality control in the kitchen, affecting our overall perception of the establishment.

In conclusion, while Asian Noodle House in Dickson has the potential to offer a satisfying meal, the lack of professionalism in addressing customer concerns and the inconsistencies in flavor left a negative impression. It's my hope that the management will take these feedback points into serious consideration to elevate the dining experience for future patrons. As it stands, I left the restaurant with a sense of disappointment that overshadowed the positives.

Text: Love the classic Brodburger! The beef patty is super juicy, and the burger is loaded with leafy lettuce, tomato, stretchy cheese and an addictive aioli and tomato relish. Bun was soft, feeling fresh and fluffy. And the onion rings were delicious too. It seemed like they had been freshly battered and fried; I’ve had crunchier, but actually enjoyed the slight soft doughiness after the initial crisp outside.

Nice outdoor seating with fairy lights, and leaves makes you feel like you aren’t that close to a big car park and the old bus depot. Service I received was friendly :)

Text: This is my absolute favourite burger place in the country and anytime I come down to Canberra I always have to go get a brod burger.

There was a bit of an unfortunate mix up with our order last time I visited and we were left waiting for a very long time for our food: as soon as we alerted the staff they were incredibly apologetic and fixed it up immediately. Their customer service when dealing with a hangry customer (its me, hi) was great and I immediately was no longer annoyed, and my mood was instantly lifted as soon as I had the first bite of this delicious burger.

Text: Me and my friends visited the Brodburger Kingston franchise on a calm Saturday night and I was shocked by the service of one of the workers. As she didn’t listen to my friend ordering and didn’t put down her burger in our order. Even worse she didn’t read out the order after we finished ordering. Otherwise Brodburger is an amazing place but this time I was genuinely disappointed by their service.

Text: Lovely place, open space and relaxed vibe.

We didn’t feel very welcome by the person in the counter at the time of making the order. Not sure what was wrong, because it was laughing and smiling to everyone else before and after us 🙃. However the wait wasn’t that long as everyone says… maybe because wasn’t weekend.

The food was really good in general, but the bread was soooo dry. Unsure if that was the way it was meant to be served, but was extremely brittle.

The first impression of the place puts the expectations really high, the whole experience can be improved 😊💪🏽

Unfortunately on arrival at the restaurant. We where informed that the all you can eat was lunch time only. We decided to stay anyways.

The food was of good quality and came out quickly but all dishes had a fair amount of chilli on them. This may have been our fault though with what we ordered.

I definitely look forward to coming back to hopefully try the all you can eat for $20 at lunch time
