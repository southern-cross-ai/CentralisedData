Place: Hotel Grand Chancellor Hobart
Author: Natalie Debono
Rating: 4
Text: The Grand Chancellor is a delightful hotel that made our stay in Hobart truly enjoyable. The rooms are modern and comfortable, with a great selection of pillows to ensure a good night's sleep.

While the buffet breakfast was nice, it was fairly average. The only downside was that good coffee came at an additional charge and wasn't included in the buffet.

Parking was conveniently available on the premises, though it was an extra expense.

One night, we ordered room service. The burger and fries were lovely, but the penne was somewhat disappointing.

The down stairs bar area is lovely and drinks were reasonable.
We also visited the indoor pool, which was a lovely area and very well maintained.

Make sure you ask for a water facing room

Overall, we had a pleasant stay and would definitely return. I recommend the Grand Chancellor to anyone visiting Hobart.

I would highly recommend getting breakfast included as there is a relatively vast range of breakfast options. Rooms were spacious and clean, and the bathrooms were relatively modern.

Text: Lovely hotel in an ideal location on the Hobart waterfront. Rooms are nice, would suggest selecting and paying more for a room that has a view of the harbour (for obvious reasons). It‚Äôs obviously not a cheap hotel however the hotel doesn‚Äôt try and hide that it‚Äôs a high end place to stay. Carpark underneath with plenty of places, nice pool and GREAT gym for a hotel. The sauna is actually a bit hidden as it‚Äôs  inside the bathrooms in the gym and not the swimming pool area‚Ä¶so when you head down there‚Äôs no signage to tell you this point unless you physically go into the gym area and into the bathroom where there‚Äôs a door in each gender toilet to get into the shared sauna

The lobby is vast and nice and clean. The location is 100% one of the best with amazing views. The swimming pool and gym and sauna are nice and clean. To access the sauna, you must walk through the gym! The TV doesn't have Netflix, but you are able to connect your own devices and account to it and watch with your own access and account. Parking is very convenient and for $20 a day, totally worth it. Recommend!

The staff were so friendly and kind, insisting dessert be brought up after dinner for in-room dining and leaving me a gorgeous hand-written birthday card.

We had a view out to the docks and could see boats come in. If you do stay we recommend the free art tour which was interesting both for the art and the historical facts about the IXL jam factory.

Text: Again and again, I return to Henry Jones because simply it is incomparable to any other place I‚Äôve stayed across the world. The warmth of the staff is symbiotic with the hotel ambience. In a word, it is enchanting. From the moment you walk through the doors you are captivated. Each room is exquisite and unique, stone walls and long timbers framing the art laden walls. With windows which peer out on the quiet ambiance of Hobart docklands and views reaching the mountains which hold the timelessness of this city. .The presentation is  perfection. Looking forward to visiting yet again for another memorable experience. Thank you to the staff who continue to provide exceptional hospitality.

Nothing compares to this place. Do yourself a favour and enrich your soul with a piece of Hobart history.  Soon you will be sitting by the window, looking out upon the docks, remembering the importance of beauty and its own place in the history of our hearts, writing a review of your own.

Text: We had a lovely stay at the Henry Jones Art Hotel in Hobart. The location is on the waterfront, in a historic building and a lovely walk to the high street, Salamanca Market and the MONA ferry. Room was very large and charming, including a large bathtub with jacuzzi feature. Gina at the front of house was a stand out - she was always bubbly and so helpful, providing excellent recommendations for food and parking. We stayed at the hotel for a night, left for a few days to visit Cradle Mountain and returned for the rest of our stay in Hobart. On our return, we were pleasantly surprised by a personal card and locally produced chocolates in our room. On our last day, Gina came through yet again with another card and chocolates for each person in our party. Thank you to all and especially Gina at the Henry Jones Art Hotel for making us feel so welcome! Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone visiting Hobart.

The fire was going and the vibe of this place is so inviting and relaxing. The owner Jay, I believe, is an absolute legend. So friendly, so accommodating and made us feel so welcome.

My partner and I shared 2 gluten free pizzas, and both were sensational. The bases are handmade to order, on site and are probably the best I've ever had.

We didn't get the chance to try anything else but we will definitely be back to work out way through the menu.

They couldn‚Äôt give me one of the rooms where the air conditioning was working so without any assistance from them had to find another hotel. The receptionist was incredibly rude - she knew I was ill and needed air con and did absolutely zero to sort out a solution, or to treat me with respect. Note the listed ‚Äúwindows that open‚Äù only open a crack. Avoid booking here - you could end up needing to scrounge for another hotel room yourself because of repair issues - with no assistance and not even a printed refund reciept.

We loved exploring Battery point and Salamanca. There is also the Salamanca fresh supermarket nearby for groceries. We had the 1 bedroom studio with kitchen and it was very comfortable.

It‚Äôs perfectly located, within walking distance of just about everything, and very close to two Skybus stops in the city. Lots of excellent eating options within spitting distance, and the perfect base for exploring this unique destination.

I was so impressed by the hotel itself too, and especially by its staff. It‚Äôs a beautiful old hotel that has been impeccably maintained, but it is an OLD hotel, so it may not look modern, especially the bathrooms. I did not see this as a fault, however, it was just part of the deal. The room was charming and spotlessly clean, and housekeeping did a great job every time. Kellie and Anthony at reception were especially charming and helpful, but the whole team presented a friendly and attentive service.

Text: The hotel itself is rich in history and the decor is what you would expect. The rooms were kept very tidy and clean, as was all areas of the hotel. My only gripe is the parking and the access to it. By the way, if you ask me (a customer) how was my stay and I give you feedback on the parking, I don't expect a lecture on how lucky I am to get parking for $5 a day. Let me be very clear here, the parking location is terrible. You have to walk down the street and around the corner of another street to find the entrance. There are 8 levels (including 4a, 5a, 6a, etc) to circumnavigate each time you enter or leave the building. It feels like a trek in it's own right and to be honest, put us off even wanting to use the car. Yes, it's $5 a day, however most, if not all hotels have their own carparks. I actually would've been happier to pay $20 a day for parking if it was more accessible. It should be more clear on your website on the parking situation. This would at least give people a choice on whether to rent a car or not. Otherwise, thank you for a lovely stay in the hotel.

Depending on want your looking it has a bar area and smaller rooms to eat or alternatively sit in the newly renovated restaurant open plan bistro. Both are nice, however I would have preferred the quieter rooms to eat as it a bit crammed amongst bigger tables..
Nonetheless the waitress that serviced us was excellent. We had starter octopus, a small warm Mediterranean Salad with a few tiny pieces of octopus which was nothing like what was presented on their website which was disappointing, 2/5.
The Salmon was cooked perfect, 5/5 and the steak was deliciously charred to perfection 4/5, with the only complaint being the potatoes were uneatable due to the excessive chunks of garlic and each side for the steak including sauce is + $$$

Rooms were clean, bathrooms, presentable and modern. And the Central location is fantastic but that's where the good features end. The place is difficult to find even with maps. Poor signage from street & No car park. We were greeted by a snarky evening manager who spoke poor English at best and less compassion. Even though it was a Sunday night and there was no patrons in the hotel. The music cranked loudly well after 9:00pm through the paper thin floor into our room.  Tried to approach the main bar only to find all entrances locked and unnaccessable.the noise stopped eventually, and we finally got to sleep only to be woken at 6:00am by what can only be described as someone hitting a  metal garbage can lid with a shifting spanner. Tried to approach the staff again only to be faced with the same problem, locked out. I do not recommend this place, but it does have a few good points mentioned above. We rate this 2 thumbs down üëéüëé

Text: My experience at the Foreshore Hotel was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed with warmth and hospitality that made me feel right at home.

The hotel's location, right along the foreshore, was breathtaking. I had stunning views of the water, and the convenience of being close to the beach was a definite plus. The ambiance in the hotel was relaxed and inviting, making it a perfect place to unwind and take in the coastal charm.

The accommodations were comfortable, well-appointed, and impeccably clean. Whether you're staying in a room or a suite, you can expect a high level of comfort and modern amenities.

If you're looking for a coastal getaway in Australia with stunning views, comfortable accommodations, and outstanding hospitality, I highly recommend the Foreshore Hotel. It's a hidden gem that left me eager to return for another visit.

However, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't anything special provided for our anniversary dinner, like a complimentary cake. Overall, it was a decent experience.

We got seated quickly in the ship-themed place, which was cool (Thank you). But we had to wait a bit too long for our main meal. The staff were nice, but sometimes they forgot about us.

Getting drinks and simple stuff like salt took longer than it should have. It's not a big deal, but it can make a difference in how much you enjoy your meal. When we asked, though, they fixed it fast. If they pay a bit more attention to these things, Drunk Admiral Hobart could be even better for people who love ships and good food.

Thank you üòä

The famed chowder was delicious but a bit too rich. The wok curry was good but not better than any white / cashew curry dish  you can get from any Thai restaurant. Everything else was okay or a miss. The decor was definitely fun especially if you are into the pirate theme.

It is more of a tourist experience than a restaurant for good food.

Text: Steer clear of Tuesday afternoons for ordering!

My recent visit to this spot left much to be desired. 4:25 pm on a Tuesday, the staff seemed rather inattentive. My online order for two footlong subs was a letdown. They were missing ingredients and sloppily put together. One sub didn't even have sauce or capsicum, and the cheese was only on one side. Despite the store being practically empty, with only one other customer, my order wasn't ready at the designated pickup time. I made the mistake of waiting instead of keeping an eye on them while they finished the last sub. It's possible the staff were new and still getting the hang of things, but if that's the case, their trainer should have supervised more closely. It was frustrating to experience.

The golf course was a beautiful place to get married, the view from the reception space was amazing. Bar staff are very friendly also. I have had so many compliments on how beautiful our wedding was. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Laura and the Royal Hobart Golf team.

Sadly the course is just not up to scratch for its ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù title. The greens are mostly the same back to front sloping with very little variety and despite perfect greens the condition of the fairways was very poor.
Reminds of every small town country golf course you‚Äôd expect but with a premium price tag.

Text: Jean-Pascal Patisserie is a local cafe with a highly-rated reputation, but my experience left much to be desired. The small cafe has limited seating, both indoors and outdoors, and also boasts a shop at the end of the road. Unfortunately, the ambiance was marred by unwelcoming staff and poor presentation.

While the cafe is praised for its high rating, the food proved to be average at best. The ricotta and cheddar tart lacked flavor, and the croissant with grilled bacon failed to impress. The coffee, touted as a highlight, was surprisingly average.

The limited seating area may contribute to the cozy atmosphere. Despite its positive reviews, my visit left me puzzled as to why it holds a 4-star rating. Perhaps others have different tastes, but for those seeking a warm welcome, flavorful dishes, and exceptional coffee, Jean-Pascal Patisserie may not live up to the hype.

MONA is literally my favorite thing in Hobart and enjoyed visually dissecting and mentally deciphering the installations of modern and thought-provoking art. Some installments were huge, others small, others took up half the building and some were shocking....so definitely not for children, especially ones who ask questions as you probably won't have an answer for half the things on display. Many will say the art is weird or nonsensical, but I found many installations quirky and wonderful.

Their app allows the people to leave their milquetoast opinions, which are remarkably similar to the low reviews here. Those who take issue with the alleged ‚Äúdownfall‚Äù of contemporary art should stay clear of the museum and revise their reactionary talking points. If you are such a prude maybe stay in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (which is great, no shame there). My only real issue is that it is incredibly expensive to get there, $60 for the ferry and admission is bonkers.

Text: Staff were warm and welcoming - especially for an early Monday morning visit.
Can never say no to Mediterranean style breakfast and the Turkish did not disappoint. The labneh, pickles and hummus were standouts and full of flavour.
Without hyperbole, the coffee was some of the best I‚Äôve had in years.

Text: This place is an absolute gem. Super cute little Cafe with a beautiful setting, very welcoming and cosy. Our waitress was a bit under the pump but she handle herself well and we understood the rush of getting in our order before menu change. So many incredible options, it was hard for us to decide. We were hungry too so naturally we over ordered. We ordered the Kimchi friend rice to share. This was hands down one of the best fried rices ever. ü§§ we also order 2 brekky mains as well, which was definitely too much but so worth it. We had the Mediterranean and the Turkish breakfast. Very very generous portions but the flavours were spot on. I'm not a huge fan of falafel but I was even impressed by those. The beautiful rich sauces and the accompaniments with each dish was incredible. Will definitely be back and highly recommend! 5 üåü

Their willingness to accommodate us, despite the incident being entirely our fault, was incredibly gracious and reflective of their commitment to customer satisfaction.
Throughout the process, the staff maintained a positive and cheerful attitude, ensuring that we felt valued and appreciated as guests in their caf√©.
Thank to the staff's gracious hospitality and the caf√©'s inviting atmosphere.

She had brown hair and was short and looked between 18-21ish. There was an incident with girls wearing full black and duffels smoking in there, I just needed to use the toilet and she was yelling at me as i‚Äôm minding my own business. Not an apology nothing, so unprofessional never going here again!!!

Text: How can someone go so wrong at a Subway Franchise. Utter disappointment at its best.

Bread was undercooked from beginning, cheese was laid unevenly on a Footlong sub (one side getting 3 slice cheese and other one just had 1 slice). Seems like their toaster is broken or the staff doesn't know how to toast a bread properly. After that with putting the salad on the bread it felt like the staff had brought the salad from their home and are on a cost cutting mode. Had to request 3 times to add same salad to atleast bring it to nominal filling.
A young lady serving thought that she's quick in preparing a Sub but she has been missing out on all the important steps in making a decent Sub. Feels like she hasn't been taught at all.

I ordered two foot longers online and it was clearly mentioned in my receipt that need to bes tosted but no one bothered. I mentioned that no tomatoes but they just filled it up with tomatoes. It was way to cold like I took something out from the fridge and straight away eaten it.

The subway was made poorly, putting minimal toppings on.

Text: Finally decided to write something about the fuel station,
First of all, last week I went to wash my car, but instead I made mess of my mats of my car, the floor of the car wash is just gross. Today I went to fuel up and there was a lady leaning on the counter looked like she was chilling and seeing me she wasn‚Äôt definitely happy. I asked her how she was instead of any answer she said ‚Äúnumber 1 50 dollars‚Äù. Then I was trying to tap my card but the efpos wasn‚Äôt responding after that as per her logic I tried to remove my card from card cover to tap it still wasn‚Äôt going through. She then snapped the card from my hand without asking me tapped herself. It wasn‚Äôt nice. She definitely has no idea about customer service. No greetings no thank you. The lady wasn‚Äôt wearing any uniform. She was wearing a black and white striped top. Not gonna come back here. Really unprofessional service.

Tonight there was one worker on his own getting absolutely slammed as person after person and multiple groups came in, one lady (possibly Uber) was standing at the counter in the way holding her phone up as the staff member was trying to check out customers, one customer complaining loudly about the wait time. Felt really bad for the staff member trying his best to keep up! Maybe roster more staff on for peak times as it‚Äôs not pleasant for the staff or customers.

Slammed it close and abruptly says something like 'aint got it' - no explanation as to no small bills, maybe would you like to buy a drink, or anything like that. I was shocked and as I stood there she aggressively follows up with 'not happening pal' and basically stared me down. Completely unreasonable customer service.

Text: Unfortunately I have to give one star to this KFC since it‚Äôs the bare minimum for Google Maps.

I ordered for Zinger Crunch Salad Bowl last night after 9:30pm. The store was freezing cold and it took them over 20mins to put together a salad, of course they didn‚Äôt bother about informing us about the wait. When I held the box my hands became even colder. Never felt that way in any other store.

The salad box was filled with maroon coloured water and half the box was filled with it! The salad was stinking and only chicken felt fresh! It felt like someone cancelled on the salad order and this was sitting in their freezer since forever!? Check the pictures to see how much water was in the bowl. Seriously pathetic!!

Text: Photos won't depict the quality of the food.

Ordered the original box, and the chicken piece, as well as the patty, was very chewy and stale. Felt like it was sitting there for a while and reheated numerous times.

Mum's zinger chicken box had a burger that was cooked well, but the chicken strips were not cooked fully.

There was only one guy who was cooking while two ladies just stared and weren't as actively involved in the job. The floor of the kitchen was flooded (oil or water?) with chicken pieces fallen and left there.

It was rather busy when we turned up but there were a couple of tables inside where we could sit.  I decided on the Po Boy filled with lettuce, tomato, chicken and bacon topped with a killer Spicy Satay sauce that was to die for.  For a drink I chose a dirty Chai Latte which all came to about $28, so worth the value.  The dish was more than enough to fill me.

The staff were super friendly, the wait time was more than acceptable given how busy they were and the value is great.  Would be the perfect place for breakfast also.
