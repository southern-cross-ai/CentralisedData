Text: Loved this hotel! Quirky and stylish. Great service. Arrived early and the team were helpful, storing our bags all day and having them ready in the room on arrival. The room was larger than any other ‘standard’ room I’ve had which was nice. Amenities great and bed super comfortable. Love that the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom but the gap in the door meant you could hear and smell… well… everything. Heard plumbing sounds constantly, too so suggest ear plugs. Would definitely stay here again despite these few things.

Text: QT Sydney - you have my heart!

Thank you again to the beautiful and amazing Justine and team. This was my second stay at the QT in Sydney and it will forever be my most favourite hotel!
Justine always makes me feel like the most special guest. Her energy is so warm and always has the most outstanding customer service!
The QT really does feel like a place of magic, adventure and wonder. It will always be the place I book when I want a little fun, to relax or get my dose of excitement!
My room was beautiful and so clean.
Thank you so much again and I will hopefully see you again soon!

Also I am very sorry, I somehow managed to delete my previous review when trying to post this one! :(

Only negatives (small ones), nowhere to hang a hand towel or anything else in the bathroom, and the sound of toilet filling or other plumbing sounds most of the night.

Text: Perfect location, quirky art deco style of decor but unfortunately my two week stay was let down by the basics.

Got charged extra for breakfast despite it being included as part of my room rate (since been refunded).

Complimentary milk, as a basic, was rarely replaced and I had to request it from the reception. Shower gel too.

Breakfast sometimes took 30 minutes to take my order.

Bathroom is so darkly lit that it becomes a chore to carry out your morning routine.

Overall, feel massively let down especially for the amount of money spent. Think it's a crime for this place to be considered a 5 star hotel. Location couldn't be better though.

Text: What an absolutely terrific hotel. To start off the hotel is very hidden but it’s like a platform 9 and 3 quarters sort of vibe and the whole feel from the reception to the rooms illustrates a hogwarts/out of the ordinary vibe. Loved everything about this hotel.

The room was gloriously large, as was the balcony.  The view was magnificent, and most importantly, the staff and hotel managers were so kind, welcoming and helpful, even delivering a complimentary bottle of wine to our room along with a birthday card for my wife who was celebrating her birthday.

Great location and a quality hotel, made even better by the helpful, friendly staff.

Lovely, olde world appeal. Excellent service. Polite reception made me feel welcome.
Dining was great. Breakfast well presented, buffet style, and a great choice.
One excellent restaurant in the hotel during the evening is supplemented by a wider range just a short walk away where there's several options overlooking the Harbour.
A good view to the harbour from the balcony.

Room wasn’t serviced during the stay & staff made up excuses as to why it wasn’t done. And even after the service, they left rubbish on the bedside table & floor. Hugely disappointing. Safe to say, won’t be staying there again.

The beds definitely need to be replaced as they were super bouncy and not the greatest, and the breakfast was mediocre, however for a quick stay to/from the airport, it was good. The regular airport shuttle service was a bonus as it meant we didn't have to worry about making our own arrangements.

Text: This is a place I won’t be in a hurry to go back to, invited by a friend to visit the Stamford at Mascot for a few beverages and lite entertainment Saturday night. Enter in a quite pleasant comfortable  English decor bar ordered two beverages reasonably prices paid in cash, consumed them and proceeded to order another round, to my amazement the price had increased question the bar staff on pricing and was advised that due to the unavailability of the house spirit we were given premium. I question and advised the staff member  who served us  a so called supervisor in a jacket that perhaps in the future he should advise guests of the situation rather than take upon himself to mark up and serve a premium product without guest consent. After our encounter I went to pay with cash to my amazement advised that no cash transaction were able due to lack  off change in the float and asked with sheer arrogance to tap not bothering to ask for other forms of payment but forced to tap. Taped away consumed our beverages and  Uber to another venue which I might add made our night.
Same we had the intention of dining at a later date but won’t be in a hurry to visit this place

We enjoyed our stay so much, we decided to stay at the Amora in Brisbane later during our trip.

Text: Nice hotel in a good location at a good price point. Not as nice as others I’ve stayed at in Sydney CBD but the price point reflects this well I guess, hence the 4 stars.

The room is average. The bathroom is big but the design needs rethinking. My biggest gripe was the water pressure. It was pretty poor. I rely heavily on a good shower to wake me up and get the job done quick. Definitely did not get this. However, the bed was comfy and the telly was good.

The service I received was very good. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and professional.

Not sure if I’d stay again but would recommend based on the price.

It was easy to change and maintain the temperature and the double doors to the bathroom made me smile every time I had to swan through them! The hotel is a short walk from Wynyard Station and we had no issues walking to food and entertainment venues.

I highly recommend Swissotel Sydney for anyone looking for a luxurious and enjoyable stay in the heart of the city. We'll definitely be back!

Text: My husband and I stayed here in November 2023. This place is absolutely amazing to stay. The customer service is outstanding. Everyone was accommodating and was upgraded for our stay.

The daily breakfast buffet was excellent. So much to choose from. It can be quiet busy, but if you time it right you'll be fine.

The hotel is right at heart of the CBD and you can just walk about everywhere or catch public transport with a breeze.

The hotel facilities were excellent. We had access to the members lounge and it was great to wind down after a busy.

The bar was my favourite place to wind down and have a drink. The cocktails were delicious.

The only thing that was a downside was the elevator situation. The peak times on the elevator during the morning/evening or weekends was a challenge.

Overall, the stay was excellent and we would stay here again next time where down in Sydney. I would highly recommend this hotel.

Text: Me and my partner just checked out this morning and had a mixed experience.

There were a few minor issues, such as no umbrellas available and the pool not being heated.

I understand it was raining so there was a high demand, but just something to keep in mind if you are anticipating they will be readily available at the hotel.

The biggest inconvenience though was the fact that two of the elevators broke down for the majority of our stay, meaning only one was operational and you sometimes had to wait up to ten minutes just to get it, and sometimes there wouldn't be any space anyway.

The big positive for us was that upon checking out we provided this feedback to Solani who was so helpful, attentive and respectful that we would stay there again, whereas prior to that we were definitely thinking of going elsewhere next time.

Text: My family and I stayed here in June 2024. Location is great. Close to good shopping and the park etc. The arrival space is underwhelming at best. The front door is a hole in the wall. When you go up to reception it's nice but I wouldn't say it's anything special. Small. Very small. The service the whole weekend was HORRENDOUS! From the bar staff making the wrong drinks to 2 out of 3 lifts being broken to the waiter taking an hour to ask for our order at dinner then the food came out all mixed up. We stupidly decided to charge our drinks to our room and when we went to check out there were a dozen drinks on our account my husband didn't order! I was checking out while my husband was with the kids so I could only guess how many drinks he had. Now a WEEK LATER they've sent us an email with a bill to pay another $140 for drinks which were not added to our account at the time! They're just a mess. Its too hard. Will not bother staying here again. It's a good location but there are so many other places to choose from for sure. Save your pennies!

Text: Haven't been back to Australia since February 2023, I took my mother, misus and daughter for a walk to Darking Harbour. Stumbled pass this place and I just wanted to have a look at the menu, saw Kangaroo which I really want to try while in Australia, but the ladies wanted to go for a walk, after crossing the bridge and the restaurants there did not seem that interesting to us at that time, I just that Kangaroo dish on my mind, so we decided to walk back.

Upon arrival we got there almost 2pm, the wait staff politely inform us to please quickly order our food as the kitchen will be closing at 2:30pm which was no problem to us at all, totally understandable.

We ordered; Escargot, Kangaroo Loin, Lamb Loin, Beef Tenderloin, Chicken & Chips for my little girl, and the Warm Sticky Pudding.

Escargot was ok, Lamb and Beef was really good, well cooked and full of flavour. But the star had to be the Kangraroo, we ordered rare as recommended the meat is so tender and flavorful, this was truly memorable. Daughter enjoyed her chicks & chips. The Warm Sticky Pudding was the only dessert and it was the perfect way to end the meal, the balance of the temperature was really good.

I will be trying to find more restaurant with Kangaroo dishes while I am here, this place is highly recommended but get there a little earlier than I did. There are other dishes I really want to try. If I get the chance to be back in Australia I will definitely return for sure.

Thank you for the wonderful experience today. Keep doing what you guys are doing.

The basic cleaning is done and it looks good, but move the foot stool or look at the skirting boards and there’s dirt and dust. The pool
Look grand and it was a quiet evening in the neighbourhood. The area is good and easy access to the station but women travelling alone (or in small groups) or elderly should be very careful as the local beggars are extremely bold. We were approached  INSIDE restaurants and shops for $$ so be very aware about using cash publicly and to ready to receive very abusive language when you decline. Keep aware of who’s around you, we were followed around a few times when we were walking around with our suitcase and opted to taxi to the station to avoid more harassment.

The pool was a hit with the kids and the staff were great - especially the reception desk lady (wish I caught her name!) working each morning we were there who chatted with the kids, helped with directions, always had a smile and allowed us to leave luggage and use the pool both before check in and after check out. Rooms were very spacious with TVs in each bedroom, great view and really comfy and clean beds. We appreciated having the beds made for us each day and fresh towels delivered! Only downsides were a few kitchen items that would have been good such as peeler and chopping boards, as well as the outdated bathrooms - these need attention as ours had a broken shower head, a toilet that ran, some cracked tiles etc. For the price and the location though, we will definitely be back!

Text: I have been staying here for work regularly for about 15 years. The location is unbeatable, and the actual design of the place is very good.
However they really seem to be coasting on that location and their reputation, as the cleanliness and maintenance have taken a dive. I will still stay here, partially because it is so familiar it's like a second home. Even with the tired fittings (grime in the bathroom, old shower doors that come off their hinges) I still love it here. The staff are friendly and polite, and the courtyard and pool are great.
But it's overpriced now for the standard. It's sad when a hotel lets itself go.

Housekeeping was very friendly, and the room well-supplied with towels, extra pillows, blankets, etc. The windows are old and a bit drafty, which made the room chilly during my stay (winter—July); there is AC but no heat. The wifi is very dodgy, disconnecting regularly and so weak that I couldn't use it at times. There is a restaurant on premises but I did not visit it; there are good coffee options in the street immediately outside the hotel. The lifts are perhaps the slowest I've experienced. Overall, an older but comfortable and reasonably-priced hotel in the heart of Sydney.

Text: I had a terrible experience at this hotel. When I arrived at 3:30 p.m., the receptionist, Cindy, who was not fluent in English, was extremely rude and had a noticeable attitude. Despite having a confirmed booking through their website, she told me I would have to wait up to two hours for it to be processed and didn’t offer any alternatives. She told me to wait and then answered the phone without acknowledging me.

After waiting, I asked to speak with the manager. Cindy responded as if I was threatening her, which I wasn’t—I simply wanted to discuss the situation. She said the manager wouldn’t be available until Monday and asked me to leave, claiming she felt threatened. When I asked what I did to make her feel that way, she didn’t respond and just pointed for me to leave.

I called the hotel later, and Cindy answered again. She refused to let me speak to anyone else and said she had reported the issue to her manager. When I asked why she could speak to the manager but I couldn’t, she said it was because she was staff and that since I was no longer a customer, she didn’t have to talk to me. Then she hung up on me. The lack of proper communication, poor customer service, and Cindy’s attitude were very frustrating.

I would give this hotel zero stars, if I could.

The staff, at every experience, were fantastic. Our room was not ready yet but they took our cases, labelled them, and put them in a locked room, and we were able to go to f r walk in the nearby park which was so relaxing and exactly what we needed. We returned to the hotel to get glasses of water, freely available in the foyer, and to charge our phones - mine was flat - and the concierge was lovely. We were happy to sit and chat in the cool foyer on their lovely sofas.

Our room was lovely, with everything we needed for our stay. The bathroom was clean and we enjoyed the shower's water pressure - not always the case when travelling. We really appreciated the coffee machine in our room, as we love our real coffee in the morning!

We found the location excellent as there were some lovely places to eat nearby, and the train station just a block away was so convenient. On a couple of nights were were too tired to do anything but order room service and this was not more expensive than their cafe on the ground floor, but was always prompt and delicious.

I can highly recommend Vibe if you're staying in Sydney and need a central location. We hope to visit again in the future.

It has your standard iron. Ironing board, hair dryer. It also had a Nespresso machine.

Breakfast was great. There was a fancy espresso machine. The buffet had eggs, bacon, sausage, croissants, yogurt, fresh fruit and more.

For location, it is up the hill from the Chinatown stop on the tram. There is a bus line that stops, but we didn't use it. The tram is tap on and off with a credit card, so it was easy to use.

Moreover, the balcony floor didn't seem to be thoroughly cleaned and an air conditioning condensing unit was installed right next to the table outside, making it quite cold to use the balcony (not the most thoughtful design), which was a bit disappointing.

However, everything else is well designed and this place is still a good place to have a short stay.

I booked for 3 pax, so an additional single bed (4 - 4.5 foot width) was provided. It was comfortable enough in my opinion. The bathroom also comes with a bath tub, perfect for fall/winter to warm you up before sleep. Cleanliness was alright. Breakfast was definitely of good value for the price of 20 dollars/pax.

Text: This hotel has taken a month to refund our deposit which they informed would only be held for a week maximum.
The room we checked into was in a terrible state of cleanliness. There were spider webs all over the room, crumbs scattered on the floor and beneath the beds, and the drawers were all half open. When I informed the receptionist about the unclean room, he just stared at me with a confused expression and said, "I guess I can inform the cleaners?" This was disappointing service and no apology was given. Pretty sad considering you still have not refunded our deposit.

Service was ok but the rooms are dated, wall is too close in front of the toilet and shower head is too low, would be fine for someone no more than 160cm tall. Had a room on a lower floor and traffic noise could be heard. One day I even had a staffer show up to my room unexpectedly at 4.30pm for housekeeping, which felt like an unusual time of the day.

Because I missed a night due to my cancelled flight, followed up via email after the trip to confirm the charges and the response seemed a bit rude.

Like others, I'd say the rooms are clean & comfortable but a little dated. Room did have a small kitchenette, and was of generous size. Whilst not 5 ☆ the price was reflective of that, and given the location, perfectly acceptable. Parking is available underneath for $50 day (validated at reception). Worth considering.

We had a 1 bedroom suite. Size was good. Had large lounge/kitchen, couch tv desk, dining table & 2 chairs. Very roomy.

Very comfortable king bed.

The only negative is, it’s just a bit tired. It is an old building and they’ve done up the bathroom and repainted the whole unit. It was all clean - no complaints about the cleanliness…. But just be prepared for decor to be a little older.

We would stay again if going on a cruise.

Went there for a steak last night. Asked the waiter how thick the 500g t-bone is and he indicated more than an inch. Sadly the t-bones that came out was more like 1.5 cm thick. It was cooked nicely. The mash was incredible and also the pepper sauce, but for $68 I have had way better t-bone than that.

I even saw one of the cooks eating and plating food. Despite the disappointing steak and mashed potatoes, the attentive and welcoming service made up for it. The restaurant wait staff went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant dining experience, which left a positive impression on me.

The service was excellent and consistent. The front desk staff always greeted us and were very helpful. The room was big enough for the two of us, and the toilet was nice as well. The location of the hotel was superb - we were able to walk to almost anywhere we wanted to go to in the area - Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, Town Hall, Botanical Gardens, etc. It was very conveniently located in the centre of many of the attractions, and there were also many restaurants located nearby. It was also right beside Wynyard train station, which was very convenient when traveling to and from the airport.

Text: The Sydney Harbour B&B has (had?) much to commend it when we stayed there for 3 nights in 2019.  It is centrally located in The Rocks historic district, priced low, and offers lots of atmosphere from their own two historic buildings.  That should have earned it 5 stars from me.  But it earned barely 3 stars from my wife due to several things.  It was badly in need of a vacuuming when we arrived, but the management was unable to vacuum until the next day.  They did not even have an on-site vacuum cleaner that we could use ourselves(?!)  Another thing was that the bathroom was out-of-suite and rather dated; although not shared it was not private.  Another item for both of us was the poorly connected in-room air-conditioning ducting and seal to the outdoors.  A very cool place to stay for people with less expectations, but not so much for seasoned travelers used to pristine accommodations.

Text: Not good at all!

My mum and I stayed here over a year ago and it was disgraceful. Righto so when we arrived at our hotel we couldn't settle into our room because our room had a major leak so the owners were busy cleaning it so we left our luggage behind and went to the piers at Circular Quay, we came back and eventually settled into our room we had a bit of a look around and it was disappointing there was a bed in the kitchen, the bathroom light wasn't working, the room at the very back of our hotel room had a door leading outside that wouldn't lock and we had a little seating area outside and a gate leading outside the gate door also wouldn't lock so we could've gotten broken into with no trouble at all and there was also a mini fridge in the very back of the room and it was broken and leaking so when I told the owners they said it was supposed to do that. Breakfast, at breakfast the toaster wasn't working properly had to toast the bread about 5 times to become actual toast really the only thing that was good at breakfast was the orange juice but that was just drinkable. So glad we got to leave the next day onto the cruise ship, we spoke to some over the people who also stayed at the hotel the same day as us and they also had a horrible experience and they aren't even from Australia. Very poor experience never again 😔

Breakfast was fantastic, as you are given an all you can eat wide selection from fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, roasted potatoes, cereal, bagels, and other food items. My only complaint is that it can be a bit difficult to find, as it's located up off of the street level and only has a small sign that's hard to see. Fantastic experience overall and would definitely recommend to those looking for a bit more peace, quiet, and comfort in the Rocks area.

They seriously need to hire professional cleaners who can give the rooms a thorough deep clean.  Our room was disgusting. Thick dust under furniture, mold and hair in the bathroom.  There was a double bed squeezed into the kitchen area !!  and the place is so noisy, creaking floorboards, people talking, running water etc.  The breakfast is disappointing, funny tasting bacon & eggs, the toast is ok but takes a long time then there’s the obstacle course to get to a table as room is so tiny.  The photos of the building/rooms are so misleading, make it look a lovely place/lovely rooms and the reviews that some people have written, makes you wonder who wrote them.   I love heritage buildings and this one could be nice if the layout was given some thought, the food improved and more importantly the cleanliness.  They say they do the cleaning daily.  Take a look at the photos, they speak for themselves.  We were only there 2 nights so just put up with it.  Definitely won't be going back.

"I had an amazing stay at Nomads Sydney, and a big part of that was thanks to Zara! From the moment I arrived, she made me feel like I was part of the Aussie family. Her warm welcome and infectious smile set the tone for an unforgettable experience.

Zara went above and beyond to give me a true taste of Australian culture. She introduced me to some amazing local spots, from hidden beaches to authentic eateries serving up delicious meat pies and flat whites. Her knowledge and passion for the city were inspiring, and she even taught me some Aussie slang to impress the locals!

The hostel itself was top-notch, with comfy rooms, a lively atmosphere, and a great communal kitchen. But it was Zara's warmth and dedication that truly made me feel like I was living like a local. If you want an authentic Australian experience, look no further than Nomads Sydney and ask for Zara!"

But, you know what? It was actually pretty great. The room gave us exactly what we needed – a clean spot to crash, a comfy bed, and some peace and quiet. It's not like we were looking for five-star luxury with this price tag, but the essentials? Spot on.

We were to find out later the person was sent away for not having enough ID. We contacted the vendor to be told that’s just too bad and they had sold the room to another person and there were to be no refunds. So basically the charity I work for lost $500 and a homeless person slept on the street all weekend. Very sad and unfortunate situation. Have worked in homeless services for many years and have never had an issue like this.

Text: I stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to the university where I was attending a conference. Before arriving I thought that it was rather expensive for Travelodge, but I figured it must be updated in some way and they did have a monopoly close to the university. However, I have been totally underwhelmed by the experience. The lobby does seem updated, But the rooms are dated. There's no place to plug your phone in close to the bed and so it has to be across the room. The bathroom was not very clean when I checked in including hair in the shower. this problem is exasperated because they did not clean my room the first night I've been here. This was after I specifically asked the cleaning staff to clean my room. The front desk staff has been incredibly Pleasant and professional. However, they seem continuously overworked and understaffed. The bar did not open at all on Saturday night, and is open but unstaffed tonight. there's a brand-new Holiday Inn around the corner and I'd highly recommend staying there as opposed to this Travelodge.

This evening, everyone from floor staff to kitchen, went above and beyond for me to provide a vegan meal without any warning. The chef was so accommodating and imaginative and our wait staff so helpful and kind to make this possible for me. Another reason why this is a 5 star establishment - and very vegan friendly! The meal was superb. The ambience is always top notch. Generous addition of house made focaccia was swoon worthy.

Don’t miss this place! A true asset of the area. And the bakery-cafe (open daily) is a god send for locals- open 8 to 4 every day for snacks and lunch fare as well as household staples. Haven’t tried the new Lodges yet but that will be our next stop ;)

I would never have ordered that pizza can't stand anchovies. Will NEVER go back or recommend. What a waste of money straight in the bin. DISGUSTING....Wish you could give negative stars. Maybe if you order on menu log they get it right.

The room I had (16) was very big, clean and everything you needed.
The only criticism is the water in the shower, it was just one level above cold at night, though about 8am it seemed normal.
I chose here for easy access to Central Station to the airport. You can't get any closer.

This was at 5pm, just as the kitchen opened, so it was obvious that no one took the initiative to do re-stocks that day. And it was plain that there was no one around the place in charge. I'm sticking with the Crystal Place where they take an active interest in providing pub grub.

Text: Not my first time to WBH for lunch, but totally not worth the hike there in my opinion.   We sat in the ground floor inside section which felt a bit like a cafeteria. Would have loved to have sat outdoors but the tables with food were being swarmed by seagulls.

Our table inside wasn’t cleared with empty glasses and plates from the previous occupants, so they sat there for the whole duration. The waiter even watched me wipe the table with a dirty napkin and turned the other way. Inside was just a sea of cheap chair & tables with no vibe, not much in terms of decor (but the pizza oven was cool). The service was non existent.

The food menu is great, but with those prices I’d expect a better experience with a more comfortable table to dine at and better service.

Probably a great place to have drinks outside as the outside area has a great vibe!

As you can see from the photos, there is no shame in ordering a plate of pad Thai here. It is one of the best examples you will find this side of Bangkok, along with their Thai milk tea.

My advice is to start with the 'One plate wonders' section of their menu and work your way out from their. You will find dishes from the many regions of Thailand, with some fusion dishes mixed in for good measure, all of the highest quality.

Pricing is as you would expect for this level of quality.

The steak was great and best chips I have had, ever!! A very helpful and friendly waiter. The best part, they got everything right! The food and drinks and even cocktails they recommended were 10/10, zero service mistakes and 10/10 for the food portion size and taste! I will come back here again!! Thanks for a great dinner.

If you are visiting for the first time, I used Google maps to find the location while walking from the W Hotel/Imax and it sent me a very round the world way..if you are looking for this place it’s 2 doors down from Nick’s seafood near the main waterside footpath, near the bird statues and water fountains in the middle area where all the restaurants are. Don’t use Google maps for directions, it sends you to the back of the building to a main road..it’s not there. It’s on the main strip next to all the other restaurants.

Text: My family and I ordered the Australian Wagyu Beef and Kangaroo Meat. Firstly, the location of the restaurant near Darling Harbour offers a beautiful view. However, the quality and taste of the food were completely unacceptable. I couldn't believe that the Wagyu Beef was covered with black grill marks. I ordered the Wagyu Beef medium rare, but the surface was burnt, tasted bitter, and the meat was tough and difficult to chew. As a tourist from Asia who has enjoyed authentic Wagyu in Australia, I reasonably suspect that the Wagyu served here is not genuine. Alternatively, the restaurant might have thought that since we were tourists and unlikely to return, they could serve us subpar food.

Text: It pains me to have to write this review as I fond memories of this place. Firstly I was at the legendary Green Day secret show here in 2011 (?)- and  a mate of mine used to live across the street so we had some fun nights drinking schooners and playing Big Buck Hunter.

I went to the pub pre Souths v Chooks and we had quite a large group so had the (seemingly sensible) idea to meet in the pub closest to the ground.

Awful experience. The pub has been whitewashed of all its charm. There were about 200 NRL fans in the place but it was too hard for management to put the other NRL game happening at the time on TV. Antiques Roadshow was more appropriate apparently.
There’s no music- so absolutely zero atmosphere.
But the true shout out has to go to the genius who rostered only 2 bar staff on to deal with the pre game crowd. Long waits for drinks and frustrated, overwhelmed staff made for an extremely underwhelming experience.

I noted that they had already closed (10pm on a Friday) after the game so you can only guess they don’t want sports crowds in the venue, which is an odd thing when you buy a pub near to the stadium precinct. Avoid at all costs.

Text: Man this place has really taken a dive under new ownership. Extremely rude bar staff, food took over an hour for a chicken wrap because they had two people working out back on a Saturday, and they had the nerve to make out like I was being rude for asking where it was. They have a Saturday Burger and Beer special that isn’t available on game day (even though they are next to a stadium where sport is always on) but on Saturday there was no game on, yet the special wasn’t available because of the Pink Concert. A concert is a game now? Food was awful, they were out of a few ingredients, no salsa for the tacos, and the bread was stale. This once great pub has been gutted because they know they’ll always have overflow from sports stadium next door. Do yourself a favour and go to one of the other, much better, pubs nearby

They would have been busier had they been serving cocktails. The beers were poorly poured, the staff acted like they were from a small village where outsiders aren’t welcome.
We ordered to entrees and after waiting an hour I went to the kitchen to see if I’d missed the call. No, I hadn’t. Two people working in the kitchen on a day when a sold out event was happening across the road. When my meal was finally ready the fish tacos had no salsa on them, despite the menu stating they would. My friend’s BBQ chicken wings were drizzled with Masterfoods BBQ sauce. The wings were grey and dry.
Everything about this place was unwelcoming and unprofessional. They have 2 major stadia across the road and are unprepared for large events. They clearly want no-one but regulars going there because they do nothing to cater for anyone apart from a few old men sitting in their usual seats at the end of the bar.
If I owned this establishment I would be embarrassed to admit it.

We also noticed that another group, who had been there longer, was not asked to leave. Initially, I thought it was because they were a larger group, but the confirmation email stated that all reservations are for a period of two hours. After being informed and paying the bill, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed, fearing someone would come and force us to leave. We hurriedly finished our drinks and dessert, but seeing the next table happily chatting and drinking felt inconsistent and unfair. My partner even had to hold her little birthday cupcake and finish it on the street because there was no time to finish before we left. She was almost crying on our way home, asking why we have to be treated like this, especially on her birthday. The whole experience was traumatic. Overall, it was a disappointing experience on what should have been a special occasion.

Text: A very nice dining experience.

The food was very well executed; it is one of the very few places in Sydney that hasn't left me disappointed with a steak I have ordered. We had the skirt, which I highly recommend for its flavour. And at MS9+, it's still lovely and tender. If you are here for a steak, they pull it off well. Cooked over woodfire, it was well seasoned and had a good sear.
It was arguably served rare, despite ordering medium rare, but they do check the steak is cooked to your likeness, and for us the difference was not a big deal.

We also enjoyed the bone marrow with rare beef on toast (my favourite dish of the night), and the yellowfin tuna and Jerusalem artichokes were also nice dishes.
I would say that overall, the menu was perhaps a touch on the unimaginative for my tastes. A more generous description would be 'classic', perhaps.

Also, the menu is massive. I really felt like a set menu on offer would best guide diners through their extensive offerings.

But the food was great, and the service was some of the best I've had in any fine dining restaurant.

Text: Unfortunately not such good service. The place was empty other than 1 other table and the waiter watched us struggle to get seated with a disabled person but did not acknowledge our presence let alone aid. We waited for a long while to find out what food they might serve when the waiter was not at all occupied until we fetched menus ourselves. We then had to call the chef from the kitchen to order. Saltimbocca which is commonly veal turned out to be compressed chicken. Sorry to say food was bland using low quality ingredients and not seemingly Italian other than in name. Think the dead flower in old water on the table was fairly indicative. .

Text: Transport yourself to Italy as you step foot inside this Italian restaurant. There is an aromatic smell when you walk inside, like walking inside your grandma’s kitchen. It’s a mouthwatering waft of Italian flavours such as garlic and herbs. Either way, it smells delicious and you instantly feel hungry (if you weren’t earlier), I am very excited about what lies ahead of me on the plate.

We ordered the following dishes:

Two antipasto dishes to start with - a bowl of mixed marinated green and black olives and the BBQ mushrooms stuffed with garlic, Parmesan and herb butter. The mushrooms were juicy and exploded with flavour when you bit into them. So far, we are impressed.

Dining like real Italians, we next order primi piatti entree pasta dishes. You can choose your pasta paired with the sauce of your choice.

We ordered two entree sized pasta dishes. ‘Boscaiola’ creamy smoked bacon and mushroom sauce paired with fettuccine. This sauce is simply to die for. If you love creamy, pasta sauces, this is the one for you! It is very similar to a carbonara.

Also ordered the ‘Gamberi’ king prawns, basil, cherry tomato, shallots, kalamata olives, fresh chill, snow peas and baby spinach in extra virgin olive oil paired with spaghetti. What a dish! After the first mouthful, I was in pasta heaven. There is a real kick of chilli in this dish which I didn’t expect, but loved. It was a simple sauce as it was done simply in olive oil but had complex flavours as there were quite a few different ingredients but they were all well balanced. I had three, succulent prawns on top of this pasta.

Both of these pasta dishes were as good as dishes I’ve eaten Italy, they were packed with authentic flavour, you want to eat everything on your plate as it’s so tasty.

Moving on to the secondi main dishes, we ordered two meat dishes (where you can again choose either chicken or veal paired with the flavour of your choice served with roasted season vegetables or chips or salad:

‘Chicken Saltimbocca’ white white sauce layered with smoked hams mozzarella cheese and napolitana sauce. An amazing, flavoursome sauce paired with a juicy chicken breast and topping. Let’s just say, every bite was eaten off this plate, it was that good.

‘Veal Cacciatore’ served with roast capsicums Spanish onion, mushroom in a traditional al napolitana sauce. The thinly sliced veal was cooked to perfection, extremely tender. The sauce had a lovely tomato base and was such a comforting dish. I loved the fact that it had vegetables as well, an all round well balanced dish that I would happily want to order again.

For dolce dessert, we finished our meals off with:

Passionfruit cheesecake with homemade gelato - a good, classic cheesecake. The tart passionfruit jelly top balanced the creaminess of the cheese.

Tiramisu with homemade gelato - a decent standard Italian dessert. I would have probably personally preferred my tiramisu with more sponge finger ratio than mascarpone, the mascarpone cream was indulgently good nonetheless.

Overall, this restaurant highly exceeded any expectations, I was very impressed by the quality and flavours of the food that we ordered. The standouts really had to be the mains and pasta dishes (hard to even choose a favourite dish!). I don’t need to travel to Italy now for authentic Italian food, I can get it from Kingsford! Also good to note they do home delivery (eg. Uber Eats)

Thanks to Ms. Sam and her staff for looking after us, they were very attentive. I found out that Mamma Teresa has been around for over 40 years, with food this good, it’s no surprise!

I only have two words to end this review with: MOLTO DELIZIOSO!

Note: I dined as a guest of this venue. All views and opinions expressed are my own.

Text: Now the name says it all. Its food made with Love. The restaurant offered Italian food and pizza. Its set on the main road, so you will need to find parking in the side streets or behind.

We started with BBQ octopus and caprese salad. The octopus was nicely Charred. The salad was amazing with the chunks of mozzarella with the drizzle of balsamic.

Black Risotto – Italian Aborio rice, fruit from the sea (seafood), shallot, cherry tomato and nero di seppia

The shallots gave it an Asian kind of feel. Everything was black. It was hard to know what you were eating until you ate it. The seafood was very well cooked and they had a variety in there. This was on their specials menu.

Gamberi – King Prawns, basil, cherry tomato, shallot, olives, fresh chilli, snow peas & baby spinach

Again the shallots gave the dish an Asian feel. Maybe because we are so use to eating Chinese dishes with shallots. Anyways, this was plated beautifully. It was so pretty. The Prawns were well cooked and the dish had good flavour and spice.

Last but not least, we couldn’t leave without having a pizza!

Seafood Pizza (actually just Prawns) fresh tomatoes, Prawns, parsley & garlic. This pizza was delicious. We couldn’t finish it so we took it home and it still tasted amazing the day after!

First impression was how clean and bright this restaurant is and first class friendly staff. Coffee was nicely prepared and taste awesome. There are so many choices for coffee style but not overwhelming. You can get small dishes to share with great varieties of sandwiches and wraps to choose from. Lovely selection of delicious cakes as well. A hidden gem I might add. The Capitol Theatre is right across from here and also a short stroll to Paddy's Market and World Square shopping centre. There's a wheelchair accessible entrance here. I'm not sure if there's a lavatory here as I didn't ask. If you are looking for down to earth services with great coffee and relaxing ambience then this is a great place to visit.

The food is delicious. The nachos was so large it lasted for two meals.

The accommodation is located conveniently, only about 200m away from Concord train station.

There aren't laundry facilities at the venue, but there is a serviced laundry next door. I paid just $15 for a wash and dry to be picked up the next day—but be sure to bring cash.

A pharmacy, grocery, and other shops nearby offer a good option for picking up some quick essentials like a loaf of bread or paracetamol.

Finally, the area is very quiet with virtually no traffic . Even late at night I didn't feel any concerns about coming in to my room late. There was certainly nothing to disturb sleep at night. It was very quiet.

The broth for the phò is much better this time round and still generous with the serving, especially beef.

However, on my plate of beansprouts and basil, a very looooong piece of hair was right on top.

Very unappealing and unappetising. The plate got changed. Luckily it was not in my noodle!

In my opinion, I must prefer their phò dăc biět and crispy noodles (with seafood) dish to the wonton soup.

My previous visit review is below.

My order took a little while to arrive due to how busy they were. Rolls were good, but the dipping sauce not so much, it wasn't the peanut sauce I'm used to, I think it was hoisin sauce instead.

Phò was good, however, the broth itself is very bland. Needs more herbs and seasoning. Good size, can't complain about the portion.

I think the chef was sent home from the Hilltop last Saturday night. The curry was meant to contain chicken, which we had to search for in the tasteless sauce.
The mixed platter was burnt beyond eating. To add insult the polystyrene container melted from the oil and ruined what would have been edible.
The only good thing was the rice yet we paid over $60 for eating just rice.

Text: 1. The chicken pot tastes average and has many small bones, making the experience poor.
2. Push the pork ribs pot forward, the taste is pretty good. (The first time I went there, I ordered the chicken stew. I never planned to go there again. Then I accidentally went there and ordered the pork ribs stew. After that, I went there three or four more times.)
3. The hot pot is very average. (I ordered tomato pot once and oil dish again)
4. The side dishes actually taste pretty good, such as belly shreds.

Text: The pizza at this Alberto pizzeria is delicious! We all loved it. There are many different options and pizza types available, so there is something for everyone. The price is reasonable as well. The atmosphere of the pizzeria is nice, and the staff are really helpful and welcoming. Thank you Alberto Pizzeria ❤️❤️❤️

Text: Food here is great (first time I came they didn’t understand and one of my orders was wrong, but it was still good), but for takeaway only. I came to pick up my food and it smelled like cigarettes. Service is not amazing either.

Really disappointed this is not a margherita.
If you calling it margherita and selling it.
it's an insult to italian.

Text: BYO awesome pizza and cheap

Students, groups and families.
Pitzas are great we got the extra large ones and they were BIG with plenty of tipping on them. We went Thursday night and no one else there but we could see take outs so turnover of food keeps it fresh. Take your own drinks ( always makes it cheaper). Salad and garlic bread good.
Catch the train to St Peters train station or walk from Newtown station.
This is a really affordable and good place- not fancy- clean.
Toilets clean and staff friendly but service you need to be proactive.
We will go back with a group of friends. Not a date place but kids yes.
Love your local guide - M❤️

Text: Large menu, good prices. Portion sizes are very big. We dined in but will likely have this as a good take-out option. Garlic bread only cost $3 and was a generous amount.

Text: We went to the pub to have lunch on Wednesday, we were very disappointed with the service of one male staff. We had a few times good experience dining there before, however this time a middle aged man talked to us very rudely, said that "You just want cheap food, don't come back!"
We ordered 5 sets of lunch special plus beer, but he wanted us to order more drinks which we don't like.
Definitely, we are not going back as the man so rude to the customers that we never experienced before!

Reply to the owner,
Please refer to your menu either hard copy or online. It is clearly said on the menu $18 Rump Steaks for Wed for Weekly Specials and it is $16 with any Drink Purchase. I have explained this to your young staff, " You can charge me more."  You as the owner suddenly jumped in and forced us to buy drinks. You were very rude to us and said "You just want cheap and don't come back". We didn't say we were Chinese.  We are Australians and we fully understood your staff and you well, so it can tell from your response that you are racism. Your attitude was so bad so it ruined our family lunch. If your service was good, we would buy more drinks.

Text: We had a roast dinner here yesterday and the experience was very good. Very kid friendly and had the sport on for adults. The roast beef was very good, the Yorkshire puddings were overdone which is my only critique.

Text: Had lunch with a group of friends .
The bar staff rudely approached us and told us we couldn’t eat at our table because it was a smoking area … even though we were not in the smoking area.
Every time a staff member came through to the back fridge to retrieve food items for the kitchen , it smelt like a dead body.
Would not recommend based off the horrendous service and smell.

Text: Room very disappointing compared to photos. Our shower full of mould, toilet bowl inside dirty, not cleaned properly. No brush to clean either. Double room but only one cup supplied, TV remote didn’t work.
Glad we only stayed one night. Had to keep the door closed not the best smell.
I took photos but don’t allow uploading.
Look for review on Google.

Text: Thai Paragon is one of my local restaurants and regular haunts when I’m craving pad see ew after a workout or when my husband and I want to treat ourselves - like tonight! We ordered crispy money bags, a fresh and fragrant soft shell crab green apple salad and a roasted duck pineapple curry which was creamy and delicious. I come here almost once a month and also order takeout from here fairly often. The service is fast and attentive and I have literally never had a bad dish here. Keep up the great work

All staff were very friendly and polite

We ordered the salt and pepper squid, green curry and the lamb chops. Flavors were all excellent but the lamb chops stood out would definitely recommend to anyone
