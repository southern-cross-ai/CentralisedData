The Astronomy of Aboriginal Australia,"Ray P. Norris, Duane W. Hamacher",2009-05-31,"The traditional cultures of Aboriginal Australians include a significant
astronomical component, which is usually reported in terms of songs or stories
associated with stars and constellations. Here we argue that the astronomical
components extend further, and include a search for meaning in the sky, beyond
simply mirroring the earth-bound understanding. In particular, we have found
that traditional Aboriginal cultures include a deep understanding of the motion
of objects in the sky, and that this knowledge was used for practical purposes
such as constructing calendars. We also present evidence that traditional
Aboriginal Australians made careful records and measurements of cyclical
phenomena, and paid careful attention to unexpected phenomena such as eclipses
and meteorite impacts.",files/The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0155v1
Deceased Organ Matching in Australia,Toby Walsh,2017-10-18,"Despite efforts to increase the supply of organs from living donors, most
kidney transplants performed in Australia still come from deceased donors. The
age of these donated organs has increased substantially in recent decades as
the rate of fatal accidents on roads has fallen. The Organ and Tissue Authority
in Australia is therefore looking to design a new mechanism that better matches
the age of the organ to the age of the patient. I discuss the design,
axiomatics and performance of several candidate mechanisms that respect the
special online nature of this fair division problem.",files/Deceased_Organ_Matching_in_Australia.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06636v1
An Australia telescope survey for CMB anisotropies,"R. Subrahmanyan, M. J. Kesteven, R. D. Ekers, M. Sinclair, J. Silk",2000-02-24,"We have surveyed six distinct `empty fields' using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array in an ultra-compact configuration with the aim of imaging, with a
high brightness sensitivity, any arcmin-scale brightness-temperature
anisotropies in the background radio sky. The six well-separated regions were
observed at a frequency of 8.7 GHz and the survey regions were limited by the
ATCA primary beams which have a full width at half maximum of 6 arcmin at this
frequency; all fields were observed with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an rms
thermal noise of 24 microJy/beam. After subtracting foreground confusion
detected in higher resolution images of the fields, residual fluctuations in
Stokes I images are consistent with the expectations from thermal noise and
weaker (unidentified) foreground sources; the Stokes Q and U images are
consistent with expectations from thermal noise.
  Within the sensitivity of our observations, we have no reason to believe that
there are any Sunyaev-Zeldovich holes in the microwave sky surveyed. Assuming
Gaussian-form CMB anisotropy with a `flat' spectrum, we derive 95 per cent
confidence upper limits of Q_flat < 10--11 microK in polarized intensity and
Q_flat < 25 microK in total intensity. The ATCA filter function peaks at l=4700
and has half maximum values at l=3350 and 6050.",files/An_Australia_telescope_survey_for_CMB_anisotropies.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0002467v1
Millimetre Science with the Upgraded Australia Telescope,"T. Wong, A. Melatos",2002-07-07,"A new astronomical window into the southern skies has been opened with the
high-frequency upgrade to the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), which
allows radio-interferometric mapping of sources at wavelengths as short as 3mm.
In anticipation of the upgrade's completion, a two-day workshop was held at the
University of Melbourne in November 2001. The workshop covered a diverse range
of fields, tied together by a common theme of identifying key areas where ATCA
observations can have an impact. More than half of the talks were concerned
with molecular clouds and star formation, with the remainder covering topics
such as molecular gas in the Galactic Centre, Seyfert nuclei, and high-redshift
objects. Some early results from the 3mm and 12mm prototype systems were also
presented. In consultation with the speakers, we are presenting in this article
a summary of the talks. The original slides are available at

ATLBS: the Australia Telescope Low-brightness Survey,"R. Subrahmanyan, R. D. Ekers, L. Saripalli, E. M. Sadler",2009-11-24,"We present a radio survey carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array. A motivation for the survey was to make a complete inventory of the
diffuse emission components as a step towards a study of the cosmic evolution
in radio source structure and the contribution from radio-mode feedback on
galaxy evolution. The Australia Telescope low-brightness survey (ATLBS) at 1388
MHz covers 8.42 sq deg of the sky in an observing mode designed to yield images
with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. The ATLBS
radio images, made with 0.08 mJy/beam rms noise and 50"" beam, detect a total of
1094 sources with peak flux exceeding 0.4 mJy/beam. The ATLBS source counts
were corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution, and primary beam
attenuation; the normalized differential source counts are consistent with no
upturn down to 0.6 mJy. The percentage integrated polarization Pi_0 was
computed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarized
intensity; Pi_0 shows an increasing trend with decreasing flux density.
Simultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images,
with 5"" beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. The
observations provide a measurement of the complexity and diffuse emission
associated with mJy and sub-mJy radio sources. 10% of the ATLBS sources have
more than half of their flux density in extended emission and the fractional
flux in diffuse components does not appear to vary with flux density, although
the percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with flux
density. The observations are consistent with a transition in the nature of
extended radio sources from FR-II radio source morphology, which dominates the
mJy population, to FR-I structure at sub-mJy flux density. (Abridged)",files/ATLBS:_the_Australia_Telescope_Low-brightness_Surv.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4571v1
Regulating trusted autonomous systems in Australia,"Rachel Horne, Tom Putland, Mark Brady",2023-02-07,"Australia is a leader in autonomous systems technology, particularly in the
mining industry, borne from necessity in a geographically dispersed and complex
natural environment. Increasingly advanced autonomous systems are becoming more
prevalent in Australia, particularly as the safety, environmental and
efficiency benefits become better understood, and the increasing sophistication
of technology improves capability and availability. Increasing use of these
systems, including in the maritime domain and air domain, is placing pressure
on the national safety regulators, who must either continue to apply their
traditional regulatory approach requiring exemptions to enable operation of
emerging technology, or seize the opportunity to put in place an agile and
adaptive approach better suited to the rapid developments of the twenty first
century. In Australia the key national safety regulators have demonstrated an
appetite for working with industry to facilitate innovation, but their limited
resources mean progress is slow. There is a critical role to be played by third
parties from industry, government, and academia who can work together to
develop, test and publish new assurance and accreditation frameworks for
trusted autonomous systems, and assist in the transition to an adaptive and
agile regulatory philosophy. This is necessary to ensure the benefits of
autonomous systems can be realised, without compromising safety. This paper
will identify the growing use cases for autonomous systems in Australia, in the
maritime, air and land domains, assess the current regulatory framework, argue
that Australia's regulatory approach needs to become more agile and
anticipatory, and investigate how third party projects could positively impact
the assurance and accreditation process for autonomous systems in the future.",files/Regulating_trusted_autonomous_systems_in_Australia.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03778v1
A Radar-Based Hail Climatology of Australia,"Jordan P. Brook, Joshua S. Soderholm, Alain Protat, Hamish McGowan, Robert A. Warren",2023-06-21,"In Australia, hailstorms present considerable public safety and economic
risks, where they are considered the most damaging natural hazard in terms of
annual insured losses. Despite these impacts, the current climatological
distribution of hailfall across the continent is still comparatively poorly
understood. This study aims to supplement previous national hail climatologies,
such as those based on environmental proxies or satellite radiometer data, with
more direct radar-based hail observations. The heterogeneous and incomplete
nature of the Australian radar network complicates this task and prompts the
introduction of some novel methodological elements. We introduce an empirical
correction technique to account for hail reflectivity biases at C-band, derived
by comparing overlapping C- and S-band observations. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how object-based hail swath analysis may be used to produce
resolution-invariant hail frequencies, and describe an interpolation method
used to create a spatially continuous hail climatology. The Maximum Estimated
Size of Hail (MESH) parameter is then applied to a mixture of over fifty
operational radars in the Australian radar archive, resulting in the first
nationwide, radar-based hail climatology. The spatiotemporal distribution of
hailstorms is examined, including their physical characteristics, seasonal and
diurnal frequency, and regional variations of such properties across the
continent.",files/A_Radar-Based_Hail_Climatology_of_Australia.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12016v2
Australia Telescope Search for Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy,"Ravi Subrahmanyan, Michael J. Kesteven, Ronald D. Ekers, Malcolm Sinclair, Joseph Silk",1998-05-19,"We have made an 8.7 GHz image of a sky region with a resolution of 8 arcmin
and high brightness sensitivity using the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA). in an ultra compact configuration. The foreground discrete-source
confusion was estimated from observations with higher resolution at the same
frequency and in a scaled array at a lower frequency. Following the subtraction
of the foreground confusion, the field shows no features in excess of the
instrument noise. This limits the CMB anisotropy flat-band power to Q_flat <
23.6 microK with 95 per cent confidence; the ATCA filter function F_l in
multipole l-space peaks at l_eff = 4700 and has half maximum values at l = 3350
and 6050.",files/Australia_Telescope_Search_for_Cosmic_Microwave_Ba.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805245v1
A study of the personal income distribution in Australia,"Anand Banerjee, Victor M. Yakovenko, T. Di Matteo",2006-01-22,"We analyze the data on personal income distribution from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics. We compare fits of the data to the exponential,
log-normal, and gamma distributions. The exponential function gives a good
(albeit not perfect) description of 98% of the population in the lower part of
the distribution. The log-normal and gamma functions do not improve the fit
significantly, despite having more parameters, and mimic the exponential
function. We find that the probability density at zero income is not zero,
which contradicts the log-normal and gamma distributions, but is consistent
with the exponential one. The high-resolution histogram of the probability
density shows a very sharp and narrow peak at low incomes, which we interpret
as the result of a government policy on income redistribution.",files/A_study_of_the_personal_income_distribution_in_Aus.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0601176v1
The Australia Telescope 20 GHz Survey: The Source Catalogue,"Tara Murphy, Elaine M. Sadler, Ronald D. Ekers, Marcella Massardi, Paul J. Hancock, Elizabeth Mahony, Roberto Ricci, Sarah Burke-Spolaor, Mark Calabretta, Rajan Chhetri, Gianfranco De Zotti, Philip G. Edwards, Jennifer A. Ekers, Carole A. Jackson, Michael J. Kesteven, Emma Lindley, Katherine Newton-McGee, Chris Phillips, Paul Roberts, Robert J. Sault, Lister Staveley-Smith, Ravi Subrahmanyan, Mark A. Walker, Warwick E. Wilson",2009-10-30,"We present the full source catalogue from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz
(AT20G) Survey. The AT20G is a blind radio survey carried out at 20 GHz with
the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) from 2004 to 2008, and covers the
whole sky south of declination 0 deg. The AT20G source catalogue presented here
is an order of magnitude larger than any previous catalogue of high-frequency
radio sources, and includes 5890 sources above a 20 GHz flux-density limit of
40 mJy. All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarisation measured at 20
GHz, and most sources south of declination -15 deg also have near-simultaneous
flux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz. A total of 1559 sources were detected
in polarised total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies. We detect
a small but significant population of non-thermal sources that are either
undetected or have only weak detections in low-frequency catalogues. We
introduce the term Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) to describe these radio
sources, which have a spectral index alpha(5, 20) > +0.7 and which constitute
roughly 1.2 per cent of the AT20G sample. The 20 GHz flux densities measured
for the strongest AT20G sources are in excellent agreement with the WMAP 5-year
source catalogue of Wright et al. (2009), and we find that the WMAP source
catalogue is close to complete for sources stronger than 1.5 Jy at 23 GHz.",files/The_Australia_Telescope_20_GHz_Survey:_The_Source_.pdf,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0002v1
