    "text": "Westpac board faces reality THE share market obviously approved of the decision by Sir Eric Neal and four other Westpac directors to resign. The banks shares rose on the news. Of course, the entire board must take responsibility for the banks most recent misfortunes. And the list of departing directors does not include the names of all those directors who were on the board before 1987 when most of the bad investment decisions were made. Indeed, of those who have resigned, only Sir Eric and Mr James Scully joined the board before But Sir Eric and his fellow directors have acknowledged the basic issue of the boards responsibility, and the bank has taken an important step towards winning back the confidence of both its shareholders and the wider sharemarket. Thats the point of it all. The share market certainly was not lusting for revenge it was looking for evidence that Westpac was on top of its problems. It was hardly reassured by the sight of an almost undisturbed Westpac board and management, or by the assurances by Sir Eric in January that the worst was over just four months before the huge provisions for bad and doubtful debts and the announcement of a 6 billion halfyear loss. The result is a distinct lack of confidence that, even now, the worst is over for Westpac and its shareholders, and a reluctance to subscribe to Westpacs rights issue. Westpac is heavily exposed to the deeply depressed commercial property market. If the bank suffers more heavy losses, it could be forced to seek more capital to satisfy the Reserve Banks prudential requirements. Why pay 3 for Westpac stock now if Westpac is likely to be back in the market with another, cheaper rights issue in another 12 months Of course, there were other reasons for the spectacular failure of the Westpac rights issue circumstances beyond the control of Westpac. But Westpac was accused of bungling the timing of the rights issue it took four months to complete which, it is claimed, was twice as long as necessary, so that it was overtaken by the general decline in share prices. In any event, the result was a record 883 million shortfall of the 2 billion rights issue and a spectacular vote of no confidence in Westpacs board and management. Last week, four of Westpacs 15 largest institutional shareholders were reported to have indicated their support for a spill of all the positions on the Westpac board. Sir Eric and his fellow directors had to act to recapture the initiative. The question now is whether the market will remain satisfied with the changes to Westpacs board and management. The market will assume that the changes in the board will be followed by further changes in Westpacs senior management. Many of the senior executives responsible for the banks mistakes are still in their jobs. Mr Frank Conroy, the recentlyappointed managing director, has restructured the banks management and tightened control of its activities. Undoubtedly, the share market will want to see further evidence of the strengthening of Westpac management in the months ahead. Few will derive any pleasure from yesterdays resignations. But the Westpac board has to be seen to take its share of the heavy responsibility for the past, disastrous errors of judgment. Only then would investors be confident that Westpac had both fully accounted for and learnt from those errors. Sir Eric and the four other directors had to go for Westpac to go forward. Vietnam Lest we forget TODAYS dedication of the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial in Canberra is not just another step in this countrys acceptance of Vietnam veterans. This is the point at which the Vietnam War as experienced by the Australian men and women who were sent there, and the Vietnam War as experienced by the rest of us, begin to merge into a common memory. How that memory takes shape will have a crucial impact on the lives of veterans and their families. It will help determine the public understanding, not only of what the Vietnam War was about, but of what war in general is about. And, over time, it will affect the meaning and the significance of important national symbols such as the Anzac legend and its central hero the Digger. The fact that 20 years separates the beginning of this process and the returning home of the last Australian troops from Vietnam suggests how difficult the merger is. No soldier returning from war can expect to be completely understood by those who stayed behind. But at least those who fought in World War II enjoyed the continued support of those back home, saw the overall war effort in much the same terms as those back home, and returned home to a welcome befitting victors. That helped the two experiences of the war to merge quickly and smoothly. Not so with Vietnam. Especially in the last few years of Australias involvement, public opinion was sharply divided over the wisdom and the morality of the war. Moreover, as support for the war effort turned to a sense of failure and even guilt, it was all too easy to project those feelings onto those who had to do the fighting. For many years after the war, the experiences of those who served in Vietnam and those who didnt grew more, not less, divergent. Many Vietnam veterans claimed that the nature of the war they fought left them with special needs that other returned servicemen may not have known. And at the same time, the publics perception of the Vietnam veteran was being influenced by exaggerated American stereotypes of the antisocial, angry and alienated personality who could not readjust to society. For both reasons, Australian veterans commonly felt a sense of embarrassment about admitting to their military service in Vietnam. There is still a good deal of pain and incomprehension stemming from Australias involvement in Vietnam. But the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial is proof that there is a degree of shared understanding as well. Importantly, this is not a memorial that glorifies the war effort. Indeed, noone who reflected on the memorial could disagree that war involves a tragic loss of life and that even when that loss is deemed the lesser of two evils, war remains mankinds supreme folly. But even such a folly allows for individual acts of courage, sacrifice and service. Whatever judgements we make about the nature of the conflict in Vietnam, or about Australias involvement in it, should not get tangled up in judgements about those who fought there. Australian men and women who were sent to Vietnam fulfilled their duty to their country and did so with valour. They deserve that recognition. If we honour those who served, suffered and died in Vietnam, we may be less likely to diminish the importance of their stories, rewrite the history of the war to suit latterday purposes, or forget what a painful time it was for all of us. Getting it wrong in East Timor THE newlyinstalled Governor of East Timor, Mr Abilio Soares, says he has a plan to end years of strife and bloodshed in the territory. He wants to set up a voluntary resettlement program to move families to sparsely populated parts of East Timor with rich farming potential. The idea is to develop East Timors agricultural sector and so generate work and raise living standards generally for East Timorese. Thats not all. Mr Abilio says the program to be administered with the help of the Indonesian Army will help teach East Timorese some muchneeded discipline. And together with a course on the virtues of integration in the schools, jobs and discipline will end opposition to Indonesian rule. That is precisely the peace plan that East Timor doesnt need. There is no doubt that a lack of work and economic opportunity in East Timor fuels resentment to Indonesian rule, especially among the urban underclass in the capital, Dili. But it is hardly the source of that resentment. East Timorese have never been given a say in whether or not they want to be part of Indonesia. Ignore that and youre never going to understand their feelings. Nor have the East Timorese been given any reason to believe that their distinct culture and traditions will survive integration. Instead, the Indonesian authorities have discouraged the use of the local Tetum language and of Portuguese, promoted Islam as an alternative to the local Catholic religion, and assisted Indonesian settlers to pour into the territory with little regard for its local inhabitants. Mr Abilios program promises more of the same. East Timorese have a strong attachment to their land even many converts to Catholicism retain some animist beliefs that place great store in natural objects and the physical surroundings. Anything that even looks like threatening their hereditary land claims will provoke further conflict. Moving people around inside East Timor and inviting in outsiders will also undermine traditional communities and breakdown village structures. As for the other ingredients of Mr Abilios peace formals a dose of discipline and a pinch of proIndonesian propaganda noone in their right mind would believe that they are going to help solve the problem. And thats the real rub in this whole proposal. No governor of East Timor is ever going to have too much room for independent action until a settlement acceptable to all sides in this dispute is firmly in place. But the local governor can act as a bridge for the Indonesian authorities and the East Timorese by helping to reduce misunderstandings between the two and perhaps even pushing a genuine settlement along. To do so, he must enjoy Jakartas confidence and the respect of the East Timorese. Mr Abilios predecessor, Mr Mario Carrascalao, was able to strike just such a balance. But on his onesided, proJakarta performance since taking office last month. Mr Abilio has little hope of doing the same. Mr Abilios plan has not yet been approved by Jakarta which is not to say that it didnt originate there and the Indonesian authorities would do well to leave it that way. The plan will only anger East Timorese by reminding them of how little control they have over their own lives and aggravate tensions in the territory. A wiser course would be to put the transmigration program to East Timor on hold, accelerate the quite useful development programs undertaken by Indonesia in the territory, and search for a form of authority that allows the East Timorese to have a stake in Indonesia without being impaled on it. A question of Question Time AN implied benefit from the televising of Question Time in the Federal Parliament was the likelihood that its quality would improve with the new public scrutiny. That likelihood has not unfortunately eventuated. In fact, as the personal animosity between the Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, and the Opposition Leader, Dr John Hewson, has intensified, Question Time has become the political equivalent of feeding time at the zoo, with the parliamentary animals ripping into each other as if they were chunks of raw meat. The Opposition, with Mr Jim Carlton filling in the details, has now promised to make substantial changes in the way the House of Representatives runs. These changes include Lower House committees to examine legislation in detail committees to monitor the performance of departments and reforms to Question Time. The first two changes should be easy to introduce. They have, also, a great deal of merit in that they will help swing the balance of power back a little to the legislature from the domination of the executive. Reforms to Question Time have merit, too, but it is a fanciful notion that these will come about by telling ministers not to adopt past behaviour. The problem with this approach is that the tendency towards confrontation by the Opposition, namecalling by MPs from both sides of the House of Representatives, and the tedious prepared answers from ministers designed to soak up the time available for questions, seems to be ingrained."
