    "text": "a favourite EVERY YEAR Since the age of 14, John Patterson has worked with horses. He now has a regular lead role in Australias most popular race, the fabulous Melbourne Cup For nearly a quarter of a century, a short, lovable character named John Patterson, better known as Paddo from one end of the country to the other, has been at the centre of one of the alltime great moments in sport. Amidst the roar of the huge crowd and before an estimated viewing audience of 350 million people, John escorts the winner of one of the worlds great horse races, Fosters Melbourne Cup. John is a clerk of the course at Melbournes Flemington Racecourse, one of three who officiate at the Fosters Melbourne Cup. All expert horsemen, they are the minders of the race, ready to rush in if there is any emergency. John has been at Flemington probably 35 or 36 years. With his present job comes the traditional finery black hunters cap, pink jacket said to be named for its designer, an Englishman, Mr Pink, long boots and breeches. Barring two occasions, one when he was in hospital and another when there was a fall during the race, he has led every winner since 1969, when Rainlover, the horse he nominates as the best ever. won the Cup. I suppose there have been better times run, says John, but he was a very good twomiler. He rates Roy Higgins a one of the great jockeys and adds, But I suppose Id have to say the greatest jockey of them all was the Aborigine, Darby McCarthy. He had beautiful balance and a wonderful pair of hands not only was he a very good rider, he was also a very good horseman. In the racing industry, the top trainers are like royalty, rarely rubbing shoulders with any of the little people, as John describes himself. But for his money, Bart Cummings and T.J. Smith are two of the very best horse trainers Australia has ever produced. John describes the atmosphere on Cup day as electrifying especially when youre at the centre of it as he is. Their adrenalin is still pumping pretty hard just after theyve won, he says. The jockeys more than the horses. The jockey has taken out one of the greatest races in the world. Hes emotionally exhausted he doesnt comprehend what youre asking him to do. The three of us clerks of the course, usually stop near the mile and a quarter and see them go past after the winning post, in case anybodys in distress. Then you go back to the winning post and the jockey turns around and he comes back and I pick him up. I lead him up the roses which line each side of the track, towards the clock tower. The steward puts a lead on the horse for the winning owners who meet the horse at the mountingyard gate, just near the clock tower and they lead it from there. I escort the horse to the winners stalls. Even an old hand like John feels the extra pressure on Cup day because of the crowd. But I take it all in my stride, he adds with a grin. No use panicking thats the worst thing you can do. Unexpected incidents on Cup day have been few. A year or two ago, some blokes dressed in a bloody camel suit got over the fence and started running up the roses towards the topweight which I was leading out, he relates. It didnt look too good for a couple of seconds. Then last year, after the Cup, the strapper of the winner, Vintage Crop, and the trainers son, I think it was, both Irishmen, were so elated they raced out onto the course and wanted to pat the horse and the jockey. Well, thats just not done if they touch the jockey before he weighs in, he can be disqualified I had a job convincing them they couldnt. John, whose father was a shearer in Hamilton in Victorias Western District, came to live in Flemington when he was It was an innocent era. Flemington was like a country town in the middle of the city, its streets often filled with cattle and sheep waiting to go to the now defunct Newmarket saleyards. A hard mans town, there was little polish. There were plenty of blues, says John, but you blued and that was it. The best man won and and then you walked to the pub and got drunk. He and his family still live in Flemington. The backyard, where they run a horsebreaking business, has 28 stables, the same stables he was apprenticed to as a jockey at the age of Married for 29 years to Glenys, whom he met through her parents riding school, he is the father of three grown children, all excellent riders. Their eldest, Shane, 28, first competed at the age of one year and four days. I had a mate, a trick rider who had a baby and bragged his was the best kid in the world, jumping through fiery hoops and who knows what. But I got Shane to the show before he got his there. As a race official, John cannot place any bets on the Cup. But the rest of Australia wagered an amazing 4 million with the TAB last Cup day. I always get calls for tips and Ive picked a few winners, but not a lot, says John. Ive never been a gambler. The best of all good things get beat, but without the punter Id be without a job. On the other hand, Ive never seen a skinny bookmaker theyve always got a good suit, a good pair of shoes and a nice motor car dotted line CAROL GEORGE NIGHTMARE BIRTH, dream baby Former television star Lisa Patrick and her artist husband longed for a natural birth for their first baby, but fate had something else in mind Early last year, Lisa Patricks whirlwind romance took everyone by surprise. After meeting and falling madly in love with an attractive Spaniard, she left friends, family and a TV career to go to the US to marry him, all within two months. Now, more in love than ever, Lisa, 28, and her husband, awardwinning writer and renowned artist Gines SerranPagan, 44, are celebrating the birth of their first child. And thanking their lucky stars that all is well after complications that endangered the lives of Lisa and their beautiful boy, Francisco, delivered after the former host of Australias Funniest Home Video Show underwent emergency surgery in June. This was nothing like the birth his parents had planned. Kindred souls who share a love of the sea, nature and solitude, Lisa and Gines had decided on a tranquil underwater birth and made arrangements for a special pool to be installed in their cosy New York loft. I have never seen a woman put more energy into a pregnancy, said Gines proudly. She was incredible. She exercised, followed the right diet, read the books and went to all the classes. She was dedicated to having a natural birth but, in the end, nature played games and we just had to surrender to it. Lisa expressed her thanks for the technology that safely delivered her first child. After Francisco was born, someone, one of the midwives, I think, said I might feel grief because I couldnt have the baby the way I had planned, Lisa recounted, but I havent, I feel great. The first complication occurred about a month before the birth, when the baby was found to be an incomplete breech partly upsidedown.When Gines and Lisa decided to move to Santa Barbara, near LA, they consulted a different doctor who turned the baby in less than a minute, with a minimum of discomfort to Lisa, and at this stage, the couple was still very committed to the idea of a water birth. One of Gines aunts, who lives in Santa Barbara, had a guest house in the grounds of her home where Lisa and Gines stayed. Outside it, in the gardens, they installed a pool where the water was kept at a special temperature in preparation for the birth. We researched it well, said Gines. A water birth, attended by someone medically qualified, is quite safe and is said to reduce pain by 25 to 30 per cent. Two midwives attended once Lisa went into labour, but complications set in. It was very scary, said Gines. The contractions were very long, with only four or five minutes between them. Then the babys heartbeat dropped. He couldnt get enough oxygen. We rushed to the hospital. At one point, both the babys life and Lisas were in question. Lisas recollection is hazy. Once the contractions start, a lot happens, she said. When you go into labour, youre in another space. I was aware of the panic with the heart rate dropping, but I kept very calm and strong and talked to the baby. I could see Gines face was white with concern and worry, but for me ... it was like being in a dream. At Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, obstetrician Dr Duncan Turner, after examining Lisa and detecting a degree of foetal distress, said a caesarean section had to be done immediately. Lisa accepted his decision calmly. Then, more complications. During the operation, Dr Turner discovered Lisa had a second uterus. Because this could complicate future pregnancies, it was removed once the baby was delivered. Gines calls me superwoman, Lisa said, laughing. I was so surprised. Ive had examinations over the years and nothings ever come up about it. Dr Turner said that the abnormality of the uterus, combined with the shape of Lisas pelvis, probably contributed to a diminished blood supply to the placenta, and therefore the foetus. Lisas devotion to health and fitness, which continued until she went into labour, helped her make a rapid recovery. In fact, her recovery from surgery was so fast that she left hospital a day and a half later. Ive never seen a patient recover like this before, said Dr Turner. This is the first son for Gines, who has two grownup daughters by a previous marriage. A new life ... it is wonderful, he said. He is very beautiful. Even the nurses were impressed with him. Francisco Gines, who weighed in at a healthy 6kg, will be baptised in an adobe church run by Franciscan monks, in Carmel, California. Francisco is a favourite name in Gines family because it is the name of the patron saint of animals and means free man. Lisa became known nationally after hosting. Australias Funniest Home Video Show on the Nine Network but, in many ways, that woman has gone. In her place is someone with very different focuses. Theres the relationship with Gines that grows deeper and more special every day. And that with her baby. Of motherhood, Lisa says, Its like a new love, one Ive never felt before. Its incredible, such a complete love. You cant take your eyes off the little one. I just want to hold him. Im totally absorbed by him. CAROLE GEORGE mixed and matched Three couples disclose how love and understanding have overcome differences in their cultures Lucy and Hiro When East met West at the Sydney Japanese School three years ago, it was the start of an enriching relationship for Australianborn Lucy Howard and Hiro Shibuya. Lucy, 26, teaches English to migrants Hiro, 30, is a graphic designer. They had two wedding ceremonies, one in a Sydney church and the second in a Shinto temple in Tokyo. Lucy I was attracted to Hiro because of the person he is, not because he is Japanese. Becoming involved with another culture was a bonus. There is so much to be gained from learning about other customs. What attracted me was his calming personality and incredible honesty. Theres also his sense of humour."
